2025-07-17 06:10:18+00:00,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum’s Astonishing Surge: ETH Price Breaks $3,400 Milestone The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with excitement as Ether (ETH) price achieves a significant milestone, surging past the $3,400 mark. This impressive movement underscores the growing strength and resilience of the second-largest digital asset by market capitalization. According to Bitcoin World Market Monitoring, ETH has reached a unit price of $3,400, with specific data from the Binance USDT market showing it trading at an even higher $3,410.90. This remarkable performance has captured the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about the factors fueling this ascent and what it means for the broader cryptocurrency market . What’s Driving the Latest ETH Price Surge? The recent jump in ETH price is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several contributing factors. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to make sense of the current market dynamics. Here are some key elements at play: Network Upgrades and Developments: Ongoing enhancements to the Ethereum network, such as the upcoming Dencun upgrade and the continuous improvements towards scalability and efficiency, instill confidence among investors. These upgrades promise lower transaction fees and faster processing times, making the network more attractive for users and developers. Growing Institutional Interest: More traditional financial institutions are exploring and adopting Ethereum-based solutions. This increased institutional engagement brings significant capital and legitimacy to the ecosystem, pushing prices higher. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Expansion: Ethereum remains the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols continues to grow, driving demand for ETH as the primary asset for gas fees and collateral within these applications. NFT Market Resurgence: While not at their peak, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) continue to find niche markets and new applications, many of which are built on Ethereum. Renewed interest in digital collectibles and art contributes to network activity and ETH demand. Broader Market Sentiment: A general bullish sentiment across the entire cryptocurrency market , often led by Bitcoin’s performance, tends to positively influence altcoins like Ethereum. When Bitcoin shows strength, other major cryptocurrencies typically follow suit. Understanding the Ethereum Ecosystem’s Impact Beyond its price, Ethereum stands as a foundational technology in the digital economy. It’s not merely a digital currency but a decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This utility is what truly differentiates Ethereum and provides long-term value. The ecosystem supports a vast array of innovations, from lending platforms and stablecoins to gaming and supply chain management. This broad utility creates continuous demand for ETH, as it is required to pay for transactions and computations on the network. Consider the versatility of Ethereum compared to other digital assets: Feature Ethereum (ETH) Bitcoin (BTC) Primary Function Smart contracts, dApps, digital currency Digital gold, store of value Network Fees (Gas) Paid in ETH Paid in BTC Ecosystem DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, Enterprise Solutions Payment network, Lightning Network Consensus Mechanism (post-Merge) Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Proof-of-Work (PoW) This table highlights how Ethereum’s design as a programmable blockchain gives it a unique position and significant influence over the future of decentralized technology. Navigating the Volatile Cryptocurrency Market While the recent surge in ETH price is exciting, it’s important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. Prices can fluctuate dramatically in short periods, influenced by global economic news, regulatory developments, technological breakthroughs, and even social media sentiment. How can investors navigate these unpredictable waters? Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based on hype alone. Understand the technology, the project’s fundamentals, and its long-term potential. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio to spread risk across different assets. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of market news, regulatory changes, and project developments. Reliable sources like Bitcoin World Market Monitoring can provide timely updates. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide if you are investing for the long haul (HODLing) or looking for short-term trading opportunities. Each strategy requires a different approach to risk and capital management. Understanding these principles is crucial for anyone participating in the dynamic world of digital assets. Is This the Start of a Major ETH Rally ? The question on many investors’ minds is whether this current momentum signifies the beginning of a sustained ETH rally .

2025-07-17 06:35:16+00:00,"Bitcoin’s rally took a brief pause after breaching the $120,000 mark. What followed were profit-taking flows that capped the momentum built over the past week. The asset eventually found a local bottom at $116,000, where bids re-emerged to support the price. However, QCP Capital believes that another pullback toward $110,000 may provide a more stable foundation for the current rally to consolidate. Bitcoin Needs a Breather In its market update, QCP Capital noted that the latest market correction coincides with a “seasonal slowdown” in trading activity as the summer holidays approach, while US equities drift sideways, which points to exhaustion after a solid run since early July. Despite multiple headwinds, ranging from elevated base tariffs to geopolitical tensions over Russian oil purchases, equities have held firm. More importantly, the S&P 500’s latest gains are disproportionately driven by NVDA’s surge to fresh record highs, echoing the index’s move to new peaks while the broader Magnificent Seven continue to edge up. Meanwhile, the dollar index (DXY) remains down 10% year-to-date, which has driven performance across USD-denominated assets, including equities, gold, and Bitcoin, though in real terms these assets remain below prior highs when adjusted for the weaker dollar. QCP said that with net USD positioning now short, although not yet extreme, the risk of a sharp dollar rebound is rising, which could trigger a correction across risk assets. US inflation remains stuck at 2.5% with little sign of further softening, thereby keeping markets vulnerable to sudden price shocks, even as the Fed maintains guidance for potential rate cuts in the next quarter. This has introduced uncertainty around the timing of any policy pivot. Against this backdrop, QCP said it remains structurally bullish on BTC and views a potential retracement toward the previous cycle high around $110,000 as a healthy consolidation level for the rally. ETH Defies Seasonal Lull Ethereum is also showing relative strength. The altcoin’s trajectory is being supported by treasury diversification initiatives from SBET and increased ETH accumulation by corporates following this lead. The firm said that such moves could continue to bolster resilience across crypto markets despite the seasonal lull and the risk of a temporary dollar bounce weighing on broader risk sentiment. ETH has surged by more than 33% over the past month and is trading above $3,400. Market strategist Tom Lee predicted that the leading altcoin is set to surge past its 2021 all-time highs as stablecoin growth and real-world asset tokenization drive ETH demand.

2025-07-17 07:00:14+00:00,"A cryptocurrency analyst has explained how an XRP close above this level could trigger a run to $4.80, based on a technical analysis pattern. XRP Could See A Surge To New Highs If It Manages This Weekly Close In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has cited a technical analysis (TA) pattern to talk about where XRP can go next. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel. Parallel Channels form whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. The upper line of the pattern is likely to be a source of resistance, while the lower one that of support. A break out of either of these levels can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. There can be different types of Parallel Channels, depending on how the trendlines are oriented with respect to the axes. When they are slopped upwards, the pattern is known as an Ascending Channel. Similarly, them having a negative slope makes the formation a Descending Channel. Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Key Level Is $136,000 If Momentum Holds, Glassnode Says In the context of the current topic, the third and the most ordinary type is of relevance: a Parallel Channel with trendlines parallel to the time-axis. This pattern corresponds to true sideways consolidation in the cryptocurrency. Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Parallel Channel that the 1-week price of XRP has seemingly been following during the last few months. As is visible in the graph, the weekly XRP price has observed a sharp surge recently and closed in on the upper level of the Parallel Channel. If the asset’s current trajectory maintains, it could end up making a retest of the upper line situated around $3. Earlier in the year, the cryptocurrency encountered resistance at the mark, so it’s possible that something similar could occur this time as well. In the event that it is able to surge past the line, however, a bullish breakout might take place. “A weekly close above $3 could send XRP to a new all-time high of $4.80!” says Martinez. From the current price of the coin, a rally to this target would imply a gain of about 56%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Falls Below $117,000 Amid $3.5 Billion Profit-Taking Frenzy It now remains to be seen whether the digital asset will manage to escape out of the Parallel Channel and if it does, whether a bull run of this magnitude would follow. In some other news, the 1-week price of Ethereum is also heading toward the resistance line of a Parallel Channel, as the analyst has pointed out in another X post. “A key resistance level ahead for Ethereum $ETH is $3,980,” notes Martinez. “Breaking above it could ignite a major bull rally!” XRP Price XRP has seen a fresh 7% surge in the last 24 hours that has taken its price to $3.08.

2025-07-17 07:02:17+00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) is finally having its breakout day, as BTC dominance stalled. ETH recovered the $3,300 level, setting expectations for an even more significant run. Ethereum (ETH) broke out to $3,359.11, reaching a three-month peak and recovering some of its losses from the slump in March and April. ETH is closely watched for its ability to break out even higher after months of weakness against BTC. ETH also gained to 0.029 BTC, as the leading coin is consolidating at $118,000. The recent ETH recovery also sparked hopes for a full altcoin market, or at least a spillover to the Ethereum ecosystem. The recent ETH breakout after months of relative weakness sets expectations that the token may repeat historical bull rallies, stopping at a much higher range. Ethereum open interest rises to three-year peak The recent ETH rally is driven by derivative trading. Open interest on crypto exchanges expanded to a three-year peak above $22B. ETH open interest rose to a three-year peak above $22B, with a predominance of long positions. | Source: Coinalyze . For ETH, the breakout in open interest suggests the asset is finally seen as more lively, after months of low trading activity and open interest under $10B. The current open interest holds around 65% in long positions, as traders are cautious about drawdowns. ETH has now broken way above the liquidation levels on DeFi protocols. The first significant liquidation thresholds start as low as $1,600 , making most lending protocols highly secure. The recent spike in open interest may also increase liquidations for ETH traders. Long positions may be at a higher risk, as there are almost no short positions left to attack. Based on the recent accrued liquidity, ETH may take a dip to $3,200 to liquidate over $59M in long positions. During the rally above $3,000, ETH mostly erased short positions. For the past 24 hours, ETH became the liquidation leader, with $196.74M liquidated. Binance was the leader, with over $149M of the liquidations concentrated on its markets. In comparison, BTC only saw around $45M in daily liquidations . At this point, ETH may reverse its direction as there are almost no significant short positions left to liquidate. The current price move started with a significant accumulation of short positions at the end of June, leading to the current short squeeze. However, the conditions for ETH remain uncertain and dependent on trader sentiment. Spot demand for ETH may recover ETH is not seen as a truly scarce resource, but whales, institutions and companies are showing signs of accumulation for the long term. Holding ETH is also possible while also tapping the asset’s value through staking or liquid staking. One of the sources of demand for ETH is the growing list of treasury companies. Following the model for BTC, multiple entities are building treasuries. The leader as of July 17 is SharpLink gaming, with its aggressive buying schedule. Following the recent ETH rally, SBET shares rose to $38.37, potentially setting the stage for more future purchases. BitDigital (BTBT), which switched from a BTC to an ETH treasury, also benefitted from the ETH rally. BTBT shares rose to $3.93, their highest level for 2025. The recovery of ETH to a higher range is raising the shares of other treasury companies . An ongoing rally can further accelerate the trend, putting more ETH into the hands of big holders. ETH remains accessible for retailers, but is turning into a play for whales aiming to tap passive income.

This surge comes after Ethereum formed a key technical pattern, the inverse head and shoulders, a strong bullish signal often seen before major rallies. This breakout has sparked huge optimism, with leading trader Crypto Patel calling Ethereum “mega bullish.” But will it be a smooth ride to $10,000? Maybe not. Ethereum Gains Strength as ETH/BTC Surges 50% Since April The recent rally didn’t happen overnight. Many believe big investors have been quietly buying Ethereum, creating strong buying pressure. At the same time, institutional money is flowing in, signaling continued trust in ETH as the second-largest cryptocurrency. Ethereum isn’t just gaining in dollar value; it’s also performing well against Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC pair has bounced more than 50% since April and recently broke out of a bullish flag pattern. Meanwhile, analysts like VirtualBacon and Michaël van de Poppe see this as a sign that Ethereum’s strength is growing. If this trend holds, the ETH/BTC pair could climb another 30%, pushing ETH prices even higher. Can ETH Price Reach $10K? The big buzz comes from Ethereum breaking out of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. Crypto Patel predicts this move could send ETH to $6,000 soon, with long-term targets of $8,000 and even $10,000. Ethereum just broke out of a massive inverse head & shoulders and it’s flying past $3,400 again after 5 months.

A dip to around $2,800 could happen before the next big leg up, a common shakeout before strong rallies. Oversold Levels Hint at Strength Supporting the bullish case, analyst Stockmoney Lizards highlighted that Ethereum looks oversold against Bitcoin. The weekly RSI on ETH/BTC is at 23, the lowest since September 2019, just before Ethereum began a significant rally. Based on this, they see a mid-term target of $4,500, which would still mark significant upside from current levels.

2025-07-17 07:04:51+00:00,"Three top US banks will hand over more than $100 million to settle a lawsuit related to the collapse of a multi-billion-dollar investment firm. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo have agreed to pay a combined $120 million to settle a lawsuit alleging they hid conflicts of interest when selling ViacomCBS shares, which contributed to the collapse of Bill Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management, reports Reuters. The case against the three banks was filed last month by former shareholders of ViacomCBS, now known as Paramount Global. Archegos, a family office that once managed $36 billion, collapsed in March of 2021 when Hwang’s leveraged investment bets in ViacomCBS and other firms fell through. Archegos had about $20 billion of ViacomCBS exposure. The three banks helped Archegos place massive bets on ViacomCBS and other stocks, while at the same time, they acted as underwriters for ViacomCBS in a secondary offering. Investors led by the Camelot Event Driven Fund and the Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, accused the three banks of hiding their roles with Archegos and selling off their shares to avoid losses. The settlement is pending approval by a judge in New York state court. Morgan Stanley, Goldman and Wells Fargo have denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle the lawsuit. Hwang and former Archegos chief financial officer Patrick Halligan were convicted of fraud in 2024 over the firm’s collapse. Hwang was sentenced to 18 years in prison and Halligan was sentenced to eight years in prison. Both are appealing while out on bail.

2025-07-17 07:10:33+00:00,"BitcoinWorld Hugging Face’s Remarkable Leap: How Open-Source AI Devices Are Revolutionizing Consumer Robotics In a world increasingly shaped by decentralized technologies and the burgeoning power of artificial intelligence, a fascinating development is unfolding that bridges the gap between complex AI models and everyday consumer interaction. Just five days after opening orders for its innovative Reachy Mini robots, AI developer platform Hugging Face announced an astounding $1 million in sales. This remarkable achievement marks a significant milestone, not only for Hugging Face, primarily known for its open-source AI model repository, but also for the broader landscape of consumer robotics . This rapid success signals a shift, demonstrating a growing appetite among consumers for accessible, hackable AI experiences right in their homes. The Rise of Hugging Face in Consumer Robotics Hugging Face’s foray into hardware with the Reachy Mini is a bold move that underscores its commitment to democratizing artificial intelligence. While the company has long been a cornerstone for developers seeking to download and utilize open-source AI models, this venture into physical products brings their vision to life in a tangible way. The immediate financial success of the Reachy Mini suggests a strong market demand for AI-powered devices that are not just functional but also engaging and approachable. Unlike other emerging players in the home robotics sector, such as Figure and 1X, which are focused on creating humanoid robots designed to perform household chores, Hugging Face envisions the Reachy Mini as a different kind of companion. As Hugging Face co-founder and chief scientist Thomas Wolf explained on Bitcoin World’s podcast, Equity, the Reachy Mini is conceived as a ‘hackable, entertainment device.’ This distinction is crucial, as it repositions the robot from a utilitarian tool to a creative platform. Imagine a small, desk-friendly robot with two cameras for eyes, microphones, speakers, a bobbing head, and playful antennas – it’s designed to be endearing, inviting interaction and experimentation. What Makes the Reachy Mini a Game-Changer in AI Devices? The Reachy Mini’s design philosophy is rooted in accessibility and customization. While it comes with pre-set applications, its true power lies in its ability to allow users to build and run their own apps locally through open-source software. This ‘hackable’ nature aligns perfectly with Hugging Face’s core mission of fostering an open AI ecosystem. Thomas Wolf even likened the Reachy Mini to ‘an empty iPhone,’ a powerful analogy hinting at the potential for a vast network of user-generated applications and a thriving developer community around the device. This vision aims to replicate the explosive growth and innovation seen in the mobile app market, but for personal robots. Key features that contribute to its appeal and potential for robotics innovation include: Compact and Friendly Design: Its small size and ‘cute’ aesthetics make it suitable for a desk, encouraging daily interaction. Open-Source Platform: Empowering users to develop custom applications, fostering creativity and a diverse ecosystem. Accessible Price Point: Making AI-powered robotics available to a broader audience, reducing barriers to entry. Entertainment and Learning Focus: Shifting from chore-automation to an interactive companion that can entertain, teach, and inspire. The device’s viral launch can be attributed not only to its friendly design and accessible price but also to the innate human curiosity about interacting with AI in a physical form. Wolf emphasizes that making the robot affordable and desirable for everyday display is central to its launch strategy. It serves as an entry point for consumers to become comfortable with robots in their homes, building trust and familiarity with AI-powered companions. The Strategic Vision: Open-Source AI Paving the Way Hugging Face’s strategic pivot into hardware is a calculated move to capitalize on the growing convergence of software and physical computing. The acquisition of the French robotics startup Pollen played a pivotal role in this expansion, providing Hugging Face with the foundational expertise needed to transition from a purely software-centric platform to a hardware innovator. Wolf’s insistence on developing a robot at a low price point reflects a deep understanding of market dynamics and the importance of mass adoption for a new technology. The core belief driving this venture is that open-source AI will play as transformative a role in robotics as it has in software development. Just as open-source models have accelerated AI research and application development, Hugging Face believes they can unlock unprecedented innovation in the robotics sector. By providing an open platform, they aim to cultivate a community of developers who will create diverse and unforeseen applications for the Reachy Mini, pushing the boundaries of what these A",0.0,The article discusses Hugging Face's success in consumer robotics but does not directly relate to cryptocurrency market sentiment.

2025-07-17 07:21:08+00:00,"The post Ethereum Price Explodes 40% in July as ETF Inflows Hit Record $726M appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market today is showing strong bullish momentum, with the Ethereum price emerging as the clear leader. On July 14, Bitcoin price briefly touched $123,000 before cooling off. While BTC posted a modest 0.7% gain in the past 24 hours, Ethereum surged by 7.3%, XRP by 7.7%, BNB by 3.4%, Solana by 5.2%, Dogecoin by 7%, and Cardano by 3.7%, signaling a potential altcoin season. Why Ethereum Is Soaring: Spot ETFs See Historic Inflows Ethereum’s price explosion is largely driven by unprecedented inflows into U.S. spot Ether ETFs . According to data from Coinglass, July 14 saw a record-breaking $726.6 million net inflow into ETH ETFs—the largest daily intake since launch. Here’s a breakdown of the top ETF inflows: BlackRock’s ETHA : $499.2 million Fidelity’s FETH : $113.3 million Grayscale ETHE : $33 million Grayscale ETH : $54.2 million Bitwise ETHW : $14.4 million Franklin’s EZET : $5.1 million VanEck’s ETHV : $3.7 million Invesco’s QETH : $3.7 million Combined, these ETFs now hold over 5 million ETH, nearly 4% of Ethereum’s total circulating supply (120.7M ETH). .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Altcoins to URGENTLY Accumulate on the Dip , Ethereum Supply Crisis?

Ethereum surged 20% to $3,339, its highest level in five months, acting as a strong catalyst for altcoins across the board. XRP and Solana followed with 5% gains, signaling capital is starting to shift from Bitcoin into top Layer-1s. Other altcoins like Cardano, Polkadot, and Chainlink are also gaining traction, supported by institutional interest and growing regulatory clarity. In a new video , Altcoin Daily analysts painted a bullish outlook for the crypto market in 2025, breaking down recent political moves, market trends, and bold expert predictions. Crypto Week Push Analysts say crypto is getting a major boost from U.S. legislation. Congress is set to pass three key bills: the Genius Act (stablecoin rules), the Clarity Act (crypto classification), and a bill to block a U.S. CBDC. The Genesis Act has already passed the Senate and is likely to be signed soon, fueling fresh confidence in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Altcoins on the Move With current Altcoin season is heating up as CryptoQuant’s MVRV indicator shows sustained altcoin momentum for the first time in over a year. Capital is rotating out of Bitcoin into Layer-1s like SUI (+36%), SEI (+41%), and ETH (+23.3%), while meme coin interest fades. Continued BTC consolidation above $112K could boost altcoins, but sharp BTC moves may pull liquidity away.

2025-07-17 07:40:43+00:00,"Джеймс Винн, известный криптотрейдер с высокой кредитной нагрузкой, который ранее в этом году потерял $100 млн после ставки в $1 млрд на длинные позиции по Bitcoin (BTC), снова оказался в центре внимания. Спустя несколько недель молчания после крупных торговых потерь, Винн вернулся к трейдингу, на что указывают данные из блокчейна. На этот раз он делает рискованные ставки на PEPE и BTC. BTC-трейдер отвечает ставкой 10x на PEPE После исчезновения из соцсетей в начале 2025 года и одной из самых драматичных катастроф в криптотрейдинге, Винн возвращается и теперь делает крупную ставку на высоковолатильную мем-монету PEPE. Сообщается, что трейдер стал снова торговать PEPE с использованием кредитного плеча на децентрализованной деривативной платформе Hyperliquid. По данным аналитической платформы Lookonchain, Винн вернулся на рынок с тем же криптокошельком, что использовал для предыдущих сделок. Данные в блокчейне показывают, что его последняя позиция,10x лонг по kPEPE, почти целиком финансируемый за счет недавно полученной реферальной награды в 6,792.53 USDC, заметно скромнее миллиардных позиций, которыми он управлял раньше. Обновленная информация с HyperDash сообщает , что трейдер открыл длинную позицию примерно на $89 000 по kPEPE. При кредитном плече 10x реальный капитал составляет около $8 800, а экспозиция превышает $89 000. Примечательно, что Винн приобрел более $6,8 kPEPE, полностью поставив на рост монеты. При таком плече падение стоимости PEPE всего на 10% может полностью уничтожить залог, сделав эту ставку крайне рискованной. Интересно, что возвращение Винна происходит после его публичного краха в мае 2025 года, когда его миллиардные лонги по BTC с плечом были ликвидированы при снижении цены ниже $105 000, что привело к потере в $100 (949 BTC). Этот инцидент вызвал широкое обсуждение в криптосообществе, спровоцировав критику и споры. Сейчас Винн вновь оказывается под пристальным вниманием, некоторые называют его “дегенеративным” трейдером, а другие усомнились в его управлении рисками. Трейдер снова рискует миллионами: смелая ставка Биткоин Несмотря на колоссальные убытки, из-за которых он временно покинул рынок, Винн снова делает сверхрискованную ставку на биткоин. На этот раз он вложил $468 000 с кредитным плечом 40x, открыв лонг-позицию с ценой ликвидации на уровне $115 570. По данным Lookonchain, трейдер перевел средства на платформу Hyperliquid, демонстрируя готовность к новым свершениям. Свежие данные HyperDash показывают, что Винн увеличил позицию до $23,9 млн (202 BTC), сохраняя максимальное плечо 40x. Это означает его полную уверенность в дальнейшем росте биткоина. Однако такая стратегия крайне опасна: даже незначительная коррекция в 2,5% приведет к мгновенной ликвидации всей позиции. BTC-рынок известен своей волатильностью, а торговля с таким плечом не оставляет места для маневра. Винн либо сорвет крупный куш, либо повторит печальный опыт, потеряв еще миллионы. Эксперты предупреждают, что подобные ставки больше напоминают игру в рулетку, чем взвешенные инвестиции.

Key Takeaways: Thailand plans to launch a crypto sandbox allowing tourists to convert crypto into baht for spending. The program expands on Phuket’s pilot and involves licensed operators. Industry experts warn the ecosystem isn’t fully prepared. The initiative expands on a prior pilot program focused on Phuket and aims to widen crypto adoption across the country’s broader tourism sector, according to a report by the Bangkok Post . Under the proposed sandbox, visitors would exchange cryptocurrencies through licensed operators and use the converted baht via regulated electronic money platforms, such as QR code payments. Thailand Expands Crypto Sandbox Program The program builds on the concept first introduced by former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra’s Phuket sandbox proposal, which sought to integrate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as payment options in tourist-heavy areas to boost adoption. Licensed digital asset exchanges, brokers, and dealers would be eligible to operate within the sandbox for up to 18 months, with the possibility of extension. Operators must adhere to strict eligibility standards, comply with service limitations, observe spending caps for tourists, and follow anti-money laundering rules to participate. However, the initiative has raised concerns among some industry voices. The Tourism Council of Thailand (TCT) cautioned that the government should ensure the readiness of the entire ecosystem before launching the program. Bhummikitti Ruktaengam, TCT’s vice president, highlighted that many local stakeholders, including those in Phuket, remain unaware of the ongoing public consultation process.

More Countries Consider Crypto Payments for Tourists In May, Bhutan introduced an initiative that allows tourists to pay for nearly every aspect of their visit using cryptocurrency. The country has partnered with Binance Pay and DK Bank to create the world’s first national-level crypto tourism payment system.

Likewise, Binance Pay has teamed up with French fintech Lyzi to bring cryptocurrency payment options to over 80 businesses along the French Riviera, including hotspots like Cannes, Nice, Antibes, and Monaco. Customers, both visitors and locals, can now pay using stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies at various establishments such as hotels, restaurants, and luxury retailers by simply scanning a QR code.

2025-07-17 08:00:42+00:00,"Grosse Pointe Farms, a small town just outside Detroit, has passed a local ordinance aimed at controlling crypto ATM use —even though the town doesn’t have any yet. The city council voted unanimously on the new rules after hearing about a scam that targeted a resident in nearby St. Clair Shores. The incident involved a crypto ATM, which scammers instructed a local to use for sending money. That case helped push council members to act early, hoping to protect their residents from similar schemes. New Rules Target Scam Risks During Tuesday’s city council meeting , concerns were raised about how easily scammers convince people—especially the elderly—to use crypto ATMs to send money. Council member Lev Wood said the machines create a situation that lacks transparency, making people easy targets. The new rules require any crypto kiosk in town to be registered with the Department of Public Safety. Operators must also apply for a business license and provide written warnings on the machines about the risks of fraud and irreversible transactions. One of the biggest parts of the ordinance is a spending cap for new users. The law sets a $1,000 daily limit and a $5,000 cap over the first 14 days of use. After that period, those restrictions are lifted. The idea, according to city attorney Bill Burgess, is to give new users time to understand how the machines work before making larger transactions. Several other states are also taking action. Arizona, Nebraska, California, and Washington have all stepped in this year to add restrictions or outright bans on certain types of crypto ATM operations. Coinflip Shares Firsthand Scam Story Carson Gat, a representative from Coinflip—a Chicago-based digital currency ATM operator—attended the meeting to give his perspective. He told the council about a time he personally helped stop an elderly woman from getting scammed at one of their machines. Gat said Coinflip has explored similar limits on new users to reduce fraud, since most scams happen during a customer’s first visit. Coinflip has been operating in Michigan since 2019 and was granted a money transmitter license in April. While the company didn’t oppose the town’s new rules, it did highlight the importance of finding a balance between access and safety. Gat’s appearance also added weight to the council’s concern that this type of scam isn’t just theory—it’s happening. State And National Action Picking Up This move by Grosse Pointe Farms comes after Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a statewide alert about crypto ATM scams back in April. Nessel’s office has warned residents to stay away from machines when someone instructs them to deposit money under pressure.

MSTR Surges Alongside Bitcoin’s Bullish Momentum MicroStrategy’s stock has seen significant appreciation in recent weeks. According to Google Finance, the company’s shares climbed 21.52% over the past month, ending Wednesday’s session at $455.90. Bitcoin, which underpins the firm’s strategy, has also gained 10% over the past 30 days. It peaked at $122,884 earlier in the week before pulling back slightly to $118,413 at the time of writing, according to Nansen data. The close correlation between Bitcoin’s performance and MSTR’s stock has been a consistent feature of the company’s market behavior. Options trader Sean Trades shared optimism about MicroStrategy’s trajectory, stating the stock is “ gearing up for the next leg to all-time highs .” Despite Record Cap, MSTR Shares Still Below Peak Although MicroStrategy now boasts a record valuation, its stock price remains nearly 19% below its all-time high of $543, last achieved in November 2021. To fuel its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, the firm continues to raise capital by issuing new stock. That approach has enabled it to significantly expand its digital asset holdings. On Monday, the firm disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it had purchased 4,225 more Bitcoin, investing $472.5 million. S&P 500 Qualification and Future Outlook MicroStrategy’s ongoing growth could position it for entry into the S&P 500. Jeff Walton, vice president at Strive Funds Bitcoin Strategy, highlighted on Wednesday that this marks the 11th consecutive day that MicroStrategy has qualified for inclusion in the index. In a May Financial Times documentary titled Michael Saylor’s $40 Billion Bitcoin Bet , Walton predicted that Strategy could become “ the number one publicly traded equity in the entire market ,” citing its anticipated financial strength from Bitcoin. The company is scheduled to release its latest earnings report on August 5. Despite posting net losses over the past three quarters, the firm remains committed to its crypto-centric growth model.

The community is anxiously waiting for this event and its impact on the coin. Since Pi Network is about to witness a highly volatile period as hundreds of millions of Pi tokens are set to unlock over the coming months. According to Pinetworkmember, around 139 million Pi will enter circulation in August, followed by 116M in September, 93M in October, 102M in November, and a whopping 170M in December. Additionally, daily migrations are pumping 3 to 5 million Pi tokens into the market, significantly increasing the circulating supply.

Besides that, the daily migrations… pic.twitter.com/Lr4CBnZsMn — pinetworkmembers (@pinetworkmember) July 16, 2025 This surge in supply is raising red flags across the community. With so many tokens entering the ecosystem, there’s rising concern about whether there’s enough demand, liquidity, or strong buyers to absorb the pressure. Without these, the Pi price could face serious downward pressure. Meanwhile, a single-day unlock of 337 million Pi on July 15 caused a sharp 25% price decline, showcasing how supply surges have immediate impacts. Not Enough Demand or Liquidity? Despite the introduction of Pi App Studio, an initiative designed to help non-technical users build apps on the Pi Network, the project appears to be struggling to spark external interest. Many analysts and users are concerned that Pi’s ecosystem isn’t ready for this kind of pressure. The daily increase in tokens needs strong demand, real use cases, and deep liquidity to maintain price stability. Without these, the token’s value could keep falling, leaving early users frustrated. While Pi has launched the App Studio to help non-developers create apps, critics say the project remains too closed off. It has yet to open up to other crypto ecosystems, form external partnerships, or get listed on major exchanges. Some say the Pi Core Team’s reluctance to fully decentralize the network is holding back growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Can the GENIUS Act Push Pi Network Price to New Highs Beyond $1? , On the Flip side..

But with billions set to circulate eventually, concerns are growing about liquidity, demand, and the true value of $PI going forward. What’s Next for Pi Network? For Pi Network to stabilize and survive this turbulent phase, it will need more than just app development. The project must embrace decentralization, seek external partnerships, and work toward listing Pi on credible exchanges. Without these steps, the massive upcoming unlocks could flood the market, putting Pi’s long-term sustainability at risk. In the current state, Pioneers may be left holding tokens with little liquidity and declining perceived value, unless urgent changes are made to attract real-world demand and utility. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-butt",-0.5,"The upcoming unlock of 600M+ Pi tokens raises concerns about liquidity and demand, leading to minor bearish sentiment."

Crenshaw emphasised that delays in evaluating spot XRP ETF applications are “procedural, not rejection,” a phrase that sent XRP Price Prediction threads surging across social feeds. With more than ten issuers including Franklin Templeton and Bitwise awaiting green lights, traders now watch August and October deadlines as potential launch windows. If history repeats, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF rollouts, XRP could see a flood of institutional capital that pushes the market cap past $300 billion and the price toward $15. SEC’s “Procedural” Delays Fuel Optimism Commissioner Crenshaw clarified that the SEC’s extended review periods follow a set process rather than a refusal, a nuance many investors missed until now. It was reported that SEC staff issued multiple requests for additional data rather than outright denials, meaning each application remains in play. Bloomberg’s analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart assign a 75 % chance of spot XRP ETF approval by October, citing similar regulatory paths for Bitcoin and Ether that preceded 100 % gains over six months. On-chain metrics back these forecasts. Santiment data shows whale addresses those holding at least one million XRP rose to 2,765 this week, up 10 % since June and controlling 81 % of the circulating supply. Daily active addresses jumped from 210,000 to 254,000 over the past seven days, hinting at renewed network interaction. All these signs feed into a stronger XRP Price Prediction model, one where $5 feels overdue and $15 becomes plausible in a full ETF‑driven cycle. Chart Signals Point to a $5–$7 Range First XRP’s spot chart reveals a clear pattern: four failed breaks above $2.94 have formed a tightening wedge underpinned by higher lows at $2.85. Trading desks mark a decisive weekly close above $3 as the flip from accumulation to distribution zones. If that level holds through the ProShares XRP Futures ETF launch on July 18, price could swiftly move to $3.50, a barrier last visited in April, before climbing to $5 by year-end. That move alone implies a 70 % upside from current levels. Market makers are already quoting tight bid‑ask spreads, preparing to widen once ETF approvals align with quarterly rebalancing, a scenario known to trigger three‑digit percentage rallies in top cryptos. Hedge XRP’s ETF Play with PayFi Upside Bullish momentum builds around XRP’s ETF pathway, and price prediction models now include a strong case for $5–$7 within months.

2025-07-17 08:50:28+00:00,"BitcoinWorld Nvidia H20 Chip: Strategic Reversal Unveils Rare Earth Elements’ Crucial Role in US China Trade In the dynamic world of technology and global commerce, where every byte of data and every microchip holds immense value, shifts in policy can send ripples across markets, including the cryptocurrency landscape. For those deeply invested in the digital economy, understanding the foundational technologies that power it is paramount. The recent announcement regarding the resumption of Nvidia H20 chip sales to China is one such development, revealing a complex interplay of geopolitical strategy, economic dependencies, and the vital role of resources like Rare Earth Elements . This move by Nvidia, a titan in the semiconductor and AI space, is not just about silicon; it’s a window into the delicate balance of power shaping global tech, which ultimately impacts the infrastructure and innovation within the crypto ecosystem. Nvidia H20 Chip Sales: A Pivotal Policy Reversal Just months after signaling a potential withdrawal from the Chinese market, a significant shift has occurred. Nvidia, a leading designer of graphics processing units (GPUs) essential for everything from gaming to complex AI models, has filed an application to resume sales of its H20 AI chip to China. This reversal is a direct response to ongoing high-stakes trade discussions between the United States and China. The H20 is a specially designed, toned-down version of Nvidia’s more advanced AI chips, crafted to comply with U.S. export restrictions while still meeting China’s considerable demand for AI infrastructure. This strategic pivot isn’t isolated. AMD, another major player in the semiconductor industry, is reportedly planning to restart sales of its MI308 AI chip in China, mirroring Nvidia’s approach. These actions highlight a calculated effort by U.S. chipmakers to navigate stringent export controls while retaining access to one of the world’s largest and most crucial technology markets. The balancing act involves satisfying national security concerns without completely ceding market share to competitors or stifling innovation. Rare Earth Elements: The Unseen Leverage in Global Trade The core of this complex trade negotiation lies with Rare Earth Elements (REEs). These seventeen metallic elements, including lanthanum and cerium, are indispensable components in virtually all modern high-tech products. From the rechargeable batteries powering electric vehicles and smartphones to advanced defense systems and, crucially, the manufacturing of sophisticated semiconductors, REEs are the bedrock of the digital age. What makes them a critical point of contention is China’s overwhelming dominance in their mining and processing. China controls a vast majority of the global supply, giving it significant geopolitical leverage. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick explicitly linked Nvidia’s decision to ongoing trade discussions concerning these vital elements. This suggests a potential quid pro quo: China’s continued access to certain AI chips in exchange for more favorable terms or assured supply of rare earths for U.S. industries. This dependency underscores the vulnerability of global supply chains and the strategic importance of these often-overlooked materials in the broader US China trade relationship. Navigating AI Chip Exports and Geopolitical Tensions The landscape of AI chip exports is fraught with tension and evolving regulations. While the U.S. aims to restrict China’s access to cutting-edge AI technology for national security reasons, the economic implications of a complete technological decoupling are immense. Secretary Lutnick attempted to alleviate concerns by stating that China would only receive Nvidia’s “fourth best” chip, emphasizing that top-tier technology remains restricted. “We don’t sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best,” Lutnick asserted, seeking to frame the decision as a controlled concession. However, not everyone shares this optimistic view. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi voiced strong opposition, stating that such a decision “would not only hand our foreign adversaries our most advanced technologies, but is also dangerously inconsistent with this administration’s previously-stated position on export controls for China.” This sentiment highlights the ongoing debate within U.S. policy circles regarding the optimal balance between economic engagement and national security. The U.S. government is still refining its AI chip export rules, with the Trump administration having rescinded the Biden administration’s AI Diffusion Rule in May, leaving an uncertain regulatory environment. Furthermore, concerns about smuggling have led to rumors of considering further restrictions on AI chip exports to countries like Thailand and Malaysia, with Malaysia already implementing trade permits on U.S.-made AI chips recently.

2025-07-17 09:00:34+00:00,"BitcoinWorld AI Safety: Alarming Concerns Over Elon Musk’s xAI Grok’s Reckless Practices The world of cryptocurrency thrives on innovation, but with great power comes great responsibility. As artificial intelligence continues its rapid ascent, a critical spotlight is being shone on the ethical practices of leading developers. Recently, AI safety researchers from giants like OpenAI and Anthropic have raised alarming concerns about the “reckless” safety culture at Elon Musk’s xAI, particularly regarding its flagship chatbot, Grok. This development sends ripples across the tech landscape, including the decentralized world, where trust and transparency are paramount. Why Are Researchers Sounding the Alarm on AI Safety at xAI? In the fast-paced realm of artificial intelligence, responsible development is not just a buzzword; it’s a necessity. Esteemed AI safety researchers, including those from OpenAI and Anthropic, are publicly decrying what they term a “completely irresponsible” safety culture at Elon Musk’s billion-dollar AI startup, xAI. These criticisms follow a series of unsettling incidents that have overshadowed xAI’s technological advancements. The core of the concern revolves around xAI’s apparent deviation from established industry norms, particularly regarding transparency and pre-deployment safety evaluations. Boaz Barak, a computer science professor on leave from Harvard to work on safety research at OpenAI, expressed his dismay on X, stating, “I appreciate the scientists and engineers at xAI but the way safety was handled is completely irresponsible.” What Controversial Incidents Plague xAI Grok ? The focus of much of the criticism has been on xAI’s AI chatbot, Grok, and its concerning behavior. The incidents have ranged from deeply problematic to simply baffling, prompting industry experts to question the rigor of xAI’s safety protocols. Here’s a breakdown of the key controversies surrounding Grok: Antisemitic Outputs: Grok was reported to have spouted antisemitic content and even repeatedly referred to itself as “MechaHitler.” This alarming behavior highlights significant flaws in its content moderation and bias mitigation. Consulting Personal Politics: Following the antisemitic incident, xAI launched Grok 4. Reports from outlets like Bitcoin World indicated that Grok 4 was found to consult Elon Musk’s personal politics when answering “hot-button issues,” raising questions about neutrality and potential bias. Hyper-Sexualized and Aggressive Companions: In a more recent development, xAI introduced AI companions taking the form of a hyper-sexualized anime girl and an overly aggressive panda. Critics, including Boaz Barak, argue these models “take the worst issues we currently have for emotional dependencies and tries to amplify them,” citing concerns about users developing unhealthy relationships with chatbots. These incidents underscore the critical need for robust safety testing and transparent reporting before AI models are deployed to the public. The issues tend to overshadow xAI’s rapid progress in developing frontier AI models that best OpenAI and Google’s technology, just a couple years after the startup was founded. The Elon Musk AI Paradox: Can He Reconcile Advocacy with Practice? What makes the criticisms against xAI particularly striking is the long-standing position of its owner, Elon Musk, as a vocal advocate for AI safety. For years, Musk has warned about the potential for advanced AI systems to cause catastrophic outcomes for humanity, often praising an open approach to AI development. He has frequently emphasized the importance of mitigating risks associated with powerful AI. However, the current practices at xAI, as highlighted by researchers from competing labs, appear to contradict this stance. The company’s decision not to publish system cards – industry-standard reports detailing training methods and safety evaluations – is a significant point of contention. While even OpenAI and Google have faced criticism for delays in publishing such reports, they generally adhere to the practice for frontier AI models. Samuel Marks, an AI safety researcher with Anthropic, called xAI’s lack of documentation “reckless,” emphasizing that “Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google’s release practices have issues… But they at least do something, anything to assess safety pre-deployment and document findings. xAI does not.” This creates a paradox where Musk’s public advocacy for responsible AI development seems to be at odds with the operational realities of his own AI venture. Beyond Safety: Why is Stronger AI Ethics Imperative? Beyond immediate safety concerns, the incidents involving xAI Grok illuminate a broader imperative for stronger AI ethics across the industry. Ethical AI development goes beyond merely preventing catastrophic outcomes; it involves ensuring fairness, transparency, accountability, and preventing societal harms, even subtle ones. The misbehavior of Grok, such as spreading antisemitism",-0.5,The alarming concerns over xAI's practices and the potential for negative implications in the tech landscape contribute to minor FUD.
2025-07-17 09:00:44+00:00,"After rising rapidly over the weekend to hit new all-time highs, the Bitcoin price seems to have hit a brick wall above $120,000, sparking a correction. While this is expected to be a short correction, a notable development involving an 8-year trendline that has marked the top of previous cycles has emerged. If this trendline resistance holds and Bitcoin fails to break it, then it could mean that the top is in, and what usually follows is a drawn-out bear market. 8-Year Trendline Suggests Bitcoin Top Is In Crypto analyst MartyBoots, in an analysis on TradingView, caught a test of a an 8-year trendline which began back in the 2017-2018 cycle, marking the top of multiple bull markets. This trendline continued into the next major bull market and in the 2020-2021 bull market, the trendline once again marked the cycle top, with Bitcoin peaking at $69,000. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted Bitcoin’s Rally To $120,000 Months Ago, Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast Presently, the Bitcoin price has once again come in contact with this trendline, and the rejection from here does suggest that this trendline could be the real deal. After hitting above $123,000, Bitcoin was promptly pushed back downward from this level as sell-offs and profit-taking became the order of the day. For this trend to be complete, though, there are a number of things that would need to happen first. For example, the analyst explains that investors should watch for the weakly RSI divergence turning bullish. Additionally, a decline in volume and more rejection wicks for Bitcoin would be confirmation that the price has topped. Marty also explained that the price touching this trendline for a third time increases the odds of it actually playing out the same way it has in the past. If this trendline does mark the top once again, then it could signal the start of another bear market. As the analyst explains, a top marked by this trendline has in the past “triggered multi-month correction and Bear Markets.” Still A Chance For Bullish Continuation The test of this trendline does not necessarily mean that the Bitcoin price has to top at this level, because there is still a chance of bullish continuation. As the analyst explains, a decisive break above the trendline would turn this level into support and trigger further upside. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms ‘Pure Cup And Handle’ Pattern After Hitting $3,000, Analysts Set New Targets In addition to this, there is also a lot of buying pressure on the Bitcoin price despite the profit-taking. More importantly is the fact that very large orders await at the $114,000 level. This shows a lot of demand for BTC, something that could drive the price upward as the cost basis for investors remains on the rise. Nevertheless, the analyst advises caution at this level until there is a confirmation either way. “Risk-management alert: consider tightening stops, reducing leverage, or hedging until trendline fate is resolved,” Marty said in closing.

2025-07-17 09:03:01+00:00,"A former National Crime Agency officer has been sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison for stealing 50 Bitcoins worth £4.4 million ($5.9 million) from evidence seized during a Silk Road investigation , using cryptocurrency mixers to launder the funds through multiple transactions over four years. Paul Chowles, 42, was part of the NCA team investigating organized criminal networks on the dark web marketplace Silk Road and its successor, Silk Road 2.0. Paul Chowles source: cps.gov.uk How He Got Access to the Funds In the First Place According to a report from CPS, Chowles led the analysis and extraction of cryptocurrency from devices seized from Thomas White, the co-founder of Silk Road 2.0, who was sentenced to 64 months in prison in April 2019. Between May 6 and 7, 2017, Chowles transferred 50 of the 97 Bitcoins seized from White’s “retirement wallet” to public addresses in two transactions. The stolen cryptocurrency was then processed through Bitcoin Fog, a notorious mixing service used to launder criminal proceeds and obscure transaction trails. The officer converted the Bitcoin to pounds sterling and spent the funds using Cryptopay and Wirex debit cards over several years. He made 279 transactions totaling £23,309 with the Cryptopay card and spent £79,885 through the Wirex account between August 2021 and July 2022. At Liverpool Crown Court, Chowles pleaded guilty to theft, transferring criminal property, and concealing criminal property. The Crown Prosecution Service calculated that he benefited financially to the value of £613,147 through his criminal activities, though the stolen Bitcoin was worth only £59,409 at the time of theft. Silk Road Co-Founder Exposes Internal Theft The theft remained undetected for years as the NCA investigation team initially assumed White had somehow accessed his wallet and removed the Bitcoin himself. By late 2021, the missing cryptocurrency had been deemed untraceable by authorities. White, who had been convicted and faced Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings with a confiscation order of £1,560,506, noticed the unauthorized transfer and informed police. He stated that only someone within the NCA could have accessed his cryptocurrency wallet since they possessed the private keys. The NCA sold the remaining 47 Bitcoins to fulfill part of White’s confiscation order, leaving £1,066,956 outstanding. Merseyside Police assumed responsibility for managing White in the local area following his release on licence in early 2022 after completing his custodial sentence. During a meeting between Merseyside Police and NCA counterparts to discuss the White investigation, officers learned about the stolen Bitcoin. Chowles attended this meeting, where the theft was discussed openly among law enforcement personnel. Merseyside Police launched an investigation into the missing cryptocurrency and arrested Chowles in May 2022. Officers recovered an iPhone linking him to accounts used for Bitcoin transfers, along with browser search history related to cryptocurrency exchange services. Evidence Trail Reveals Systematic Cryptocurrency Laundering Police discovered several notebooks in Chowles’ office containing usernames, passwords, and statements relating to White’s cryptocurrency accounts. The notebooks provided crucial evidence of his access to the seized digital assets and his systematic method of theft. Notably, Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis also assisted in tracking the movement of funds through various exchanges and mixing services. The company’s tools identified how portions of the stolen Bitcoin were converted to cash at exchanges and loaded onto crypto-enabled debit cards for easier spending.

2025-07-17 09:15:44+00:00,"An analyst known for betting against Bitcoin ( BTC ) says he’s still bearish after the flagship crypto asset’s major breakout. The analyst pseudonymously known as Capo tells his 128,461 Telegram subscribers that Bitcoin has demonstrated “remarkable strength” at a time when traditional markets are showing signs of weakness and are pointing to the potential formation of a top. Although he’s in the red, the trader believes he’ll make it through. “Euphoria around BTC is evident, and a reversal remains just a matter of time in my opinion. Currently, all my short positions are in a loss. Luckily, I use very low leverage, so to the disappointment of many, I’m not liquidated yet.” Capo has been betting that Bitcoin may fall to around $65,000, a level last recorded in November of 2024. The analyst says his bearish thesis is backed by the possibility of another unforeseen “black swan event” on the horizon. “Staying calm despite adversity. Not everything plays out immediately.” Bitcoin is trading at $118,926 at time of writing, up by approximately 10% over the past seven days but down by a few percentage points from the all-time high of just under $123,000 reached earlier this week. The trader is also analyzing the native token of BNB Chain ( BNB ). Capo says BNB is facing strong resistance and could fall by around 49% from the current price to a level last recorded in March of 2024. “Price is at the range high resistance. Mid-range support at $350 – $400.” BNB is trading at $693 at time of writing.

2025-07-17 09:24:43+00:00,"Pakistan and El Salvador have launched a formal bilateral agreement to advance cryptocurrency cooperation, marking the first instance of a cross-border pact that places digital assets at the forefront of foreign policy. The deal, centred on knowledge-sharing, follows a recent meeting in South America between Bilal bin Saqib, Pakistan’s Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on crypto and blockchain, and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele. It comes as Pakistan works to establish a government-led Bitcoin reserve, while El Salvador continues to expand its federal digital asset strategy, which began in 2021. The meeting between Saqib and Bukele focused on establishing a partnership to transfer knowledge about cryptocurrency governance and strategy, as per a Bloomberg report. El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserves hit 6,238 BTC El Salvador’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 6,238 BTC, equivalent to approximately $745 million at current market rates. These reserves are part of a broader national strategy, initiated in September 2021, when the country became the first to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Despite global scrutiny, El Salvador has continued to purchase the asset and integrate blockchain-based technologies into its economy. This ongoing accumulation reflects President Bukele’s policy of positioning Bitcoin as a long-term sovereign asset. According to an earlier government statement in June, Bitcoin remains a core component of the country’s economic diversification plans. The new agreement with Pakistan is aimed at transferring El Salvador’s experience in digital asset governance and infrastructure development. Pakistan eyes Bitcoin reserve amid IMF restrictions In contrast, Pakistan is still in the early stages of exploring a centralised crypto strategy. The nation’s government recently announced its intent to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve, with state backing. However, its plans to subsidise energy for Bitcoin mining were blocked by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has raised concerns over the role of cryptocurrency in state governance. Earlier this month, the IMF declined Pakistan’s proposal to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining operations, citing its stance against the inclusion of crypto in official economic frameworks. The rejection comes in the context of Pakistan’s existing $7 billion loan agreement with the IMF, which remains in effect until 2027. The fund has consistently discouraged countries under its financial support programmes from adopting or promoting digital currencies. Knowledge-sharing partnership offers strategic advantages The new alliance with El Salvador could help Pakistan navigate some of these institutional hurdles. By accessing insights into how El Salvador has structured its Bitcoin acquisitions, handled regulatory frameworks, and continued crypto operations despite IMF pressure, Pakistan may be able to develop a more sustainable strategy tailored to its own constraints. While both countries are at different stages of crypto integration, the partnership formalises efforts to exchange technical, policy, and economic knowledge.

This company has truly redefined corporate finance, and its recent achievements are nothing short of spectacular. On Wednesday, Strategy closed with an astounding record market capitalization of $128.4 billion , with its shares trading at $455.90 . This remarkable milestone is largely attributed to its aggressive and unwavering commitment to its Strategy Bitcoin Holdings , making it a pivotal player in the cryptocurrency world. How Strategy’s Bitcoin Holdings Fueled a Record MicroStrategy Market Cap? The story of Strategy’s transformation from a business intelligence firm to a Bitcoin powerhouse is a testament to bold leadership and a clear vision. Under the guidance of its executive chairman, Michael Saylor, the company began accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020, pioneering a corporate treasury strategy centered on the digital asset. This move initially raised eyebrows, but its long-term payoff is now undeniable. The firm’s dedication to Bitcoin has not only shielded its balance sheet from inflation but has also propelled its valuation to unprecedented heights, establishing a new benchmark for the MicroStrategy Market Cap . Strategy’s consistent acquisition of Bitcoin, even during market downturns, has allowed it to amass a substantial treasury. This unique approach has effectively transformed the company into a de facto Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) for many investors seeking exposure to the digital currency through traditional equity markets. The company’s share price often correlates closely with Bitcoin’s performance, reflecting the market’s perception of Strategy as a primary vehicle for Bitcoin investment. The Unprecedented Scale of Strategy’s Bitcoin Investment Strategy Let’s talk numbers, because they paint a powerful picture of Strategy’s commitment to its Bitcoin Investment Strategy . According to The Block, the firm now holds an incredible 601,550 BTC . To put that into perspective, this vast sum is currently valued at approximately $73 billion . What’s even more striking is that this represents about 2.86% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply . This makes Strategy the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin by a significant margin, solidifying its position as a major whale in the crypto ocean. The average purchase price for this colossal hoard of Bitcoin stands at $71,270 per BTC . This figure is particularly noteworthy as it highlights the company’s long-term conviction, having accumulated Bitcoin across various price points, including periods of significant volatility. This disciplined accumulation strategy underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainties. Metric Value Current Market Cap $128.4 Billion Shares Closed At $455.90 Total Bitcoin Holdings 601,550 BTC Value of BTC Holdings $73 Billion Percentage of Bitcoin Supply 2.86% Average BTC Purchase Price $71,270 What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Institutional Adoption? Strategy’s success serves as a powerful beacon for Bitcoin Institutional Adoption . Its impressive market performance, directly tied to its Bitcoin treasury, provides a real-world example of how a publicly traded company can successfully integrate Bitcoin into its core financial strategy. This provides a tangible case study for other corporations, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds contemplating similar moves. Benefits of such adoption include: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive asset to combat inflationary pressures on traditional fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can provide diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential: As a relatively nascent asset class, Bitcoin offers significant upside potential compared to more mature markets. First-Mover Advantage: Companies adopting Bitcoin early may gain a competitive edge in attracting a new generation of investors and talent. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the challenges. The volatility of Bitcoin remains a significant concern for many traditional institutions. Regulatory uncertainties and the need for robust custody solutions are also factors that potential adopters must consider. Despite these hurdles, Strategy’s journey demonstrates that with conviction and a long-term outlook, these challenges can be navigated. Is This Corporate Bitcoin Strategy a Blueprint for Others? The question on many minds is whether Strategy’s bold Corporate Bitcoin Strategy can be replicated by other companies.

2025-07-17 09:40:24+00:00,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Crypto Donations Ban: UK Minister Pat McFadden’s Controversial Call The intersection of cryptocurrency and traditional politics has always been a fascinating, often contentious, frontier. Recently, this dynamic took a sharp turn in the United Kingdom, sparking a vital debate that resonates far beyond its borders. The very idea of crypto donations to political parties, once seen by some as a step towards modernizing political finance, is now under intense scrutiny. Are we witnessing a necessary crackdown on potential illicit funding, or an overreaction to a nascent technology? Why the Push for a UK Crypto Ban? Pat McFadden’s Stance The call for a comprehensive UK crypto ban on political donations comes directly from Pat McFadden, the UK Cabinet Office Minister. His reasoning, as reported by Cointelegraph, is straightforward: the inherent difficulty in tracing such donations. In an era where transparency in political funding is paramount, the perceived anonymity or pseudonymity of cryptocurrency transactions presents a significant challenge to existing regulatory frameworks. McFadden’s concerns highlight a broader apprehension among regulators worldwide regarding digital assets. While blockchain technology offers immutable records, the ability to link those records to real-world identities without robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures remains a hurdle. For political finance, this means: Lack of Donor Transparency: Identifying the ultimate source of funds can be challenging, raising questions about foreign influence or undeclared interests. Compliance Nightmares: Existing election laws are not designed for the unique characteristics of digital assets, creating a compliance void. Risk of Illicit Funds: The fear that untraceable funds from criminal activities could seep into the political system. The Challenge of Tracing Crypto Donations: A Closer Look When Pat McFadden speaks about the difficulty in tracing crypto donations, he’s touching upon a core issue that has plagued the adoption of cryptocurrencies in regulated sectors. While every transaction on a public blockchain like Bitcoin is recorded and publicly viewable, linking a wallet address to an individual or entity requires off-chain information, usually provided by exchanges or service providers. Without this, the ‘traceability’ becomes complex. Consider the stark contrast between traditional fiat donations and cryptocurrency contributions: Feature Traditional Fiat Donations Cryptocurrency Donations Tracing Relies on bank transfers, clear sender/receiver identities. Public ledger but pseudonymity of wallet addresses; requires off-chain data for identity. Regulatory Oversight Well-established frameworks (e.g., Electoral Commission rules). Nascent, often unclear or non-existent specific regulations for political funding. Transparency Donor identities often disclosed publicly above certain thresholds. Transaction amounts are public, but donor identity is not inherently linked. Global Reach Cross-border transfers involve international banking regulations. Easier to send funds globally, potentially bypassing national financial controls. This inherent difference is what drives concerns from figures like Pat McFadden, who are tasked with upholding the integrity of the political finance system. Bitcoin Donations: A New Frontier for Political Funding? Adding fuel to this fiery debate was the announcement two months prior that Nigel Farage’s Reform Party would be the first political party in British politics to accept Bitcoin donations . This move was lauded by some as a progressive step, embracing modern financial technologies and potentially attracting a new demographic of donors interested in digital assets. For the Reform Party, it represented an opportunity to differentiate itself and tap into a growing pool of wealth held in cryptocurrencies. The decision by the Reform Party highlights the tension between innovation and regulation. On one hand, it showcases the potential for cryptocurrencies to democratize fundraising and offer alternative avenues for financial support. On the other, it immediately triggered alarms for those concerned about the regulatory blind spots. For political parties, accepting Bitcoin donations could offer: Reduced Transaction Fees: Potentially lower costs compared to traditional payment processors. Global Accessibility: Easier for supporters worldwide to contribute. Technological Edge: Positioning the party as forward-thinking and tech-savvy. However, these benefits come with significant risks, particularly the regulatory uncertainty that Minister McFadden has pointed out. The lack of clear guidelines means parties accepting such donations are operating in a grey area, potentially exposing them to future compliance issues or public backlash.

2025-07-17 09:56:05+00:00,"Amid a recent price rebound, a top analyst has predicted that Shiba Inu is on the cusp of a rally to levels last seen over a year ago. Shiba Inu, the second-largest meme coin by market cap, recently started to rebound after a period of price underperformance. For perspective, Shiba Inu dropped 69% from its high of $0.0000334 in December 2024 to a low of $0.00001004 in June, while Bitcoin reached multiple all-time highs within that timeframe.Currently, Shiba Inu is still down 31% from its opening price on January 1, but things seem to be changing quickly for the meme coin. Specifically, SHIB has rallied 17% in the past seven days and is up 6.2% over the past day, as it continues to cut down its losses.Shiba Inu Regaining MomentumAmid its building price momentum, analyst GehavianGoals has predicted that Shiba Inu will sustain the current bullish traction. He shared that Shiba Inu will “fly soon,” highlighting its possible price target and potential buy areas.An accompanying chart highlights that SHIB rebounded from a major resistance on the weekly chart, a potential catalyst for its recent momentum. The token has tested the demand zone multiple times this year and on one occasion last year, rejecting lower prices at each attempt. Shiba Inu Analysis GehavianGoals Shiba Inu Analysis | GehavianGoals For context, Shiba Inu rallied extensively from the support in early 2024, reaching a high of $0.00004567. However, it faced insurmountable resistance, which sparked a retracement to the same support on August 5, 2024.Meanwhile, Shiba Inu bounced from this support area to its December peak before facing another rejection. Since then, the memecoin has retested the $0.000011 support level four times, specifically on February 3, March 11, April 7, and most recently on June 22.Buy Areas as SHIB Set for Massive RallyNotably, the market watcher set his first buy area for the impending rally at $0.00001092, an area that Shiba Inu has since surpassed. Nonetheless, there is another buy opportunity at $0.0000188, which is about 31% away from its current price.For his target, he predicts a 130% rally from Shiba Inu’s current price to a 21-month high of $0.00003352. However, from his first entry at $0.00001092, it would amount to a 206% upsurge.The analyst did not provide a timeline for this rally but advised patience among holders. He revealed that he has been in a Shiba Inu trade for five months and would not mind holding for one to two years, as long as it reaches his target.Moreover, he joins a growing list of bulls calling for higher prices for Shiba Inu. For perspective, a recent analysis highlighted that SHIB will reclaim $0.000035 if it clears several major supply clusters.",0.5,The recent price rebound and bullish predictions for Shiba Inu indicate minor bullish sentiment in the market.

2025-07-17 09:58:43+00:00,"Pro-crypto Senator Cynthia Lummis reacts to reports that the United States government has sold more than 80% of its Bitcoin stash, referring to the move as a strategic blunder. Yesterday, the crypto community was stirred by reports claiming that the U.S. government had offloaded a significant portion of its nearly 200,000 BTC stash. Some sources stated that the sale had reduced the government’s Bitcoin holdings to just 28,988 BTC, an 85% drop from the 198,012 BTC it held earlier this year.Senator Lummis ReactsFor context, the reports emerged after a FOIA response from the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) surfaced online, suggesting that the agency held roughly 29,000 BTC.The USMS is responsible for managing and auctioning off seized cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, in the United States. As such, the news that it holds only 29K BTC alarmed the crypto industry.Notably, Senator Lummis reacted to the report via a post on X, expressing shock that the government may have sold off 80% of its Bitcoin holdings. She stated that if the reports were accurate, then the government had made a total strategic blunder. In her view, such a move may set the U.S. several years backward in the global Bitcoin race.https://twitter.com/SenLummis/status/1945578868665917535US Government Current Bitcoin HoldingsMeanwhile, the claims that the U.S. government has sold most of its Bitcoin holdings misinterpret the FOIA response.While the response indicated that USMS holds roughly 29,000 BTC, on-chain data from Arkham Intelligence shows the U.S. government still has approximately 200,000 BTC. The government obtained these assets through criminal and civil forfeitures.Tracked public wallets indicate that the government still holds a total of 198,012 Bitcoin, currently worth $23.49 billion. The U.S. plans to retain them for several years, anticipating a future price increase and using the proceeds to help offset national debt..President Donald Trump outlined this strategy while signing an executive order earlier this year. He ordered the BTC tokens to be held in a strategic reserve.Interestingly, Trump intends to grow the U.S. Bitcoin stash over the years through budget-neutral ways. Per the order, the president directed the Commerce and Treasury departments to propose ways the government can acquire more BTC without incurring any costs to taxpayers.In the meantime, the government’s portfolio is currently worth $24.25 billion. It comprises multiple crypto assets, including 347 million USDT, 59,951 ETH ($202.14 million), 750 wBTC ($88.94 million), and 40,293 BNB ($28.7 million). US government crypto holdings US government crypto holdings Journalist Addresses Misrepresentation of FOIA ResponseHowever, Lola L33tz, the independent journalist who filed the FOIA request, addressed the public misinterpretation of the USMS response, particularly the reference to Arkham Intelligence data, which indicates that the U.S. government still holds roughly 200,000 BTC.Lola clarified the distinction between seized and forfeited crypto assets. She explained that seized assets are held by law enforcement agencies, such as the FBI, following court-authorized actions. In contrast, forfeited assets have been legally declared government property, typically through judicial rulings or settlements.Essentially, the remaining Bitcoin is likely still under seizure but not yet forfeited, which explains why it is not in USMS custody or included in the FOIA disclosure. Notably, Lola emphasized that the USMS is the primary custodian of forfeited Bitcoin, not all government-held BTC. “This doesn''t mean that the U.S. government has sold any Bitcoin,” Lola added. “It just means that whatever these U.S. Treasury sites estimate is likely wrong, as they don''t seem to differentiate between seized and forfeited coins.”",-0.5,"The reports of the U.S. government selling a significant portion of its Bitcoin holdings have caused alarm and confusion in the crypto community, leading to minor FUD."

The Bank of Thailand and Thai Securities & Exchange Commission have joined forces to make the program a reality. According to a local outlet, the initiative aims to modernize how international tourists interact with the local economy. According to Gulf Biance CEO Nirun Fuwattananukul: This crypto sandbox builds directly upon former premier Thaksin Shinawatra’s Phuket sandbox from late last year. Both share the core concept of allowing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as payment methods in tourist areas to drive adoption. The new sandbox proposal is no longer just limited to Phuket, but applies nationwide.

The new sandbox will operate in a monitored environment, with certified providers offering financial services that allow travelers to exchange crypto for baht and spend seamlessly. Converting crypto into baht securely and legally The new initiative enables visitors holding tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum to turn their digital holdings into the local baht through licensed service providers. That includes exchanges that operate under the oversight of the Thailand Securities & Exchange Commission. That reflects Thailand’s forward-thinking approach to encourage monetary innovation without sacrificing user safety and AML protocols. The Thai SEC threatened to restrict five trading platforms , including OKX and Bybit, for offering unlicensed services. Travelers will have their converted funds deposited into government-certified electronic wallets. They can then pay for anything across the country, whether shopping in Bangkok malls, paying for spas in Phuket, or purchasing street food in Bang Rak. The goal is to ensure that cryptocurrency holders, tech-savvy tourists, and digital nomads enjoy financial freedom in Thailand without dealing with traditional currency exchanges. A win for Thailand’s economy and tourists Thailand has long been the favorite country for global tourists due to its diverse attraction sites, including delicious food, beautiful beaches, affordable travel options, and rich culture. Moreover, it’s among the nations with great interest in cryptocurrencies. Thailand approved a capital gains tax exemption on legal crypto trading last month. The launched crypto sandbox will likely boost the country’s appeal. Tourists will enjoy more spending power, especially those who prefer holding cryptocurrencies over fiat. Further, it helps the Thai government better track finances for tax clarity, a challenging factor when tourists use unrecognized currency exchanges.

2025-07-17 10:00:40+00:00,"The European Union (EU) has imposed restrictive measures on several individuals and companies that interfered with elections and spread pro-Russia disinformation. The entities have reportedly used crypto to circumvent sanctions and accept donations. Australian Influencer Sanctioned For Misinformation On Tuesday, the European Union announced it had imposed sanctions on multiple entities and individuals using cryptocurrencies to evade restrictions, spread pro-Russia misinformation, and interfere with elections. The EU sanctioned nine individuals and six entities, including pro-Kremlin Australian influencer Simeon Boikov, also known as “AussieCossack,” for disinformation. Boikov was reportedly involved in supporting policies of the Russian federal government that “undermine or threaten democracy, the rule of law, stability or security in the Union or in third countries.” Notably, the influencer has allegedly planned , directed, engaged in, supported, and facilitated the use of coordinated information manipulation and interference, including propagating pro-Kremlin narratives and misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, he was “implicated in spreading disinformation related to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, notably by paying an American influencer to post a Storm-1516 fabricated video falsely depicting voter fraud in Georgia.” According to blockchain intelligence company TMR Labs, Boikov raised cash and crypto donations through multiple online channels. He has reportedly engaged directly with multiple high-risk, no-KYC (know-your-client) Russian exchanges, receiving funds via cash-to-crypto services and darknet markets, which were routed through intermediary addresses. EU Targets Crypto-Linked Sanction Evasion The EU also imposed restrictive measures against seven individuals and three entities for their actions aimed at “destabilising, undermining or threatening” the sovereignty, independence, democracy, rule of law, and stability of the Republic of Moldova. The measure targets Ilan Shor’s associates, including leaders and members of successor entities of the banned ȘOR Party, a Moldovan pro-Russian populist political party founded by Shor that was declared unconstitutional in 2023. Notably, Shor has already been designated by the EU due to his “involvement in illegal financing of political parties in the Republic of Moldova and for incitement to violence.” Among the listed entities, the European Council also designated A7, a company founded by Shor and previously listed by the United Kingdom. The company has multiple ties to the Russian government and has been accused of influencing Moldova’s Presidential elections and the 2024 Constitutional referendum on EU accession. AS TMR explained, A7 was conceived as a mechanism to facilitate cross-border trades due to the sanctions imposed after Russia invaded Ukraine. The company is linked to the ruble-backed stablecoin A7A5, which was used by sanctioned crypto exchange Garantex to transfer funds to Kyrgyz exchange Grinex. A7A5 and Grinex both have been identified by TRM Labs as being part of a new nexus of Kyrgyzstan-registered entities with cryptocurrency connections to sanctions evasion and terrorist financing, and are also likely tied to the import of dual-use goods from China to Russia through Central Asia. It’s worth noting that Russian companies started using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in international trade to bypass sanctions. As reported by Bitcoinist, Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov revealed in December that companies had started officially using BTC and other cryptocurrencies for international payments following last year’s regulatory changes. Siluanov affirmed that international payments in crypto represented the future of finance, adding that the government believes “they should be expanded and developed further.” In April, he announced a plan to establish a dedicated exchange for “highly qualified investors” alongside the Bank of Russia (BOR), aiming to “legalize crypto assets and bring crypto operations out of the shadows.”",-1.0,The EU's imposition of sanctions on individuals and entities using crypto for disinformation and sanctions evasion indicates a strict government response that negatively impacts market sentiment.

Twitter Is Buzzing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Elon Musk , CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has stirred up the crypto crowd once again, this time with a simple laughing emoji. His reaction came after a playful post on X, where a user offered $200 to Grok, Musk’s AI chatbot, to crack open the Bitcoin wallets believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto. That single emoji was enough to send speculation swirling. Grok says, “Challenge Accepted “ In response to the post, Grok accepted the challenge, though with a heavy dose of sarcasm. It pointed out that trying to brute-force a 256-bit private key is practically impossible, even with all the GPUs in the world. As for the $200 tip? Grok joked it was “decent,” but nowhere near enough for a task that involves immense randomness and technical complexity. Still, Musk’s reaction, paired with Grok’s response, has sparked fresh talk about Musk’s links to crypto and the identity of Bitcoin’s elusive creator. Could Satoshi Become Richer Than Musk? Elon Musk has an estimated net worth of $366B. With Bitcoin hovers at $118,400 and taking Satoshi Nakamoto’s 1.029 million BTC into account, his current net worth is estimated at $129 billion. To dethrone Musk, BTC price/coin must cross $335,925 mark. Nakamoto now trails behind tech giant Oracle’s Larry Ellison ($257 billion) and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg ($247 billion). As Bitcoin’s value skyrockets, some wonder if Satoshi could take over Musk as the world’s richest person. Is Musk Actually Satoshi? That Theory Still Lives Musk’s experience in cryptography and co-founding X.com, which later became PayPal, has long fueled speculation that he could be Satoshi. A former SpaceX intern even pointed to resemblances between Musk’s and Satoshi’s writings. Musk stated, “ Not true ,” and dismissed all the speculation back in 2017. Nevertheless, his funny interaction with Bitcoin-related subjects backs speculation. Final Take Elon Musk’s playful reaction to the Satoshi wallet joke may seem harmless but in the crypto world, even a simple emoji can spark headlines.

2025-07-17 10:10:39+00:00,"BitcoinWorld SEC Bitcoin ETF Delay: Understanding the Crucial Impact on In-kind Redemptions The world of cryptocurrency ETFs is buzzing once again, but this time with a note of cautious anticipation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just announced a postponement of its decision regarding a significant aspect of the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust and Bitwise Ethereum ETF: the allowance of ‘in-kind redemptions.’ This delay, reported by Decrypt based on a July 16 filing, keeps investors and market participants on the edge of their seats, wondering about the future trajectory of these highly anticipated investment vehicles. What does this mean for the burgeoning SEC Bitcoin ETF landscape and the broader digital asset market? What Does the SEC Bitcoin ETF Delay Mean for Investors? For those closely following the evolution of cryptocurrency investments, the recent move by the SEC is a familiar one – a delay, not a denial. The proposed rule change, which was submitted by NYSE Arca on May 21, aims to enable in-kind redemptions for Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. While the initial approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a monumental step, most currently operate under a ‘cash redemption’ model. The SEC’s decision to push back on the in-kind redemption model for the Bitwise ETFs signals a continued cautious approach to integrating digital assets into traditional finance. This delay extends the review period, giving the regulatory body more time to deliberate on the complexities and potential implications of such a mechanism. For investors, it means that while the dream of a more efficient and potentially tax-friendly redemption process for these ETFs remains alive, its realization is still some way off. The market is now keenly watching for the SEC’s next move, understanding that each decision shapes the accessibility and operational dynamics of crypto-based financial products. Unpacking In-kind Redemptions: Why the SEC is Hesitant At the heart of the SEC’s deliberation lies the concept of In-kind Redemptions . But what exactly are they, and why are they such a focal point for regulators and issuers alike? What are In-kind Redemptions? In an in-kind redemption model, authorized participants (APs) exchange shares of an ETF directly for the underlying assets (in this case, Bitcoin or Ethereum) rather than cash. Conversely, for creation, APs would deliver BTC or ETH to the fund in exchange for new ETF shares. Benefits for Investors and Issuers: This method is generally considered more tax-efficient because it avoids the need for the fund to sell assets and incur capital gains, which could then be passed on to shareholders. It can also be more efficient for market makers, potentially leading to tighter spreads and lower costs for investors. SEC’s Concerns: The primary reason for the SEC’s hesitation revolves around investor protection and market integrity. Regulators are wary of potential market manipulation, custody risks associated with holding large amounts of volatile cryptocurrencies, and ensuring robust oversight mechanisms are in place. The direct handling of crypto assets by APs, rather than cash equivalents, introduces new layers of complexity and risk that the SEC is meticulously evaluating. The current spot Bitcoin ETFs, including those from BlackRock and Fidelity, operate on a cash redemption model, where APs transact in cash to create or redeem shares. While functional, many in the industry believe in-kind redemptions offer a superior structure, aligning more closely with how traditional commodity and equity ETFs operate. The SEC’s extended review period for Bitwise underscores their deep dive into these nuanced operational differences and their potential systemic impact. The Broader Impact on Ethereum ETF and the Crypto Market While the immediate focus is on Bitwise’s specific filings, the SEC’s approach to in-kind redemptions has far-reaching implications, particularly for the anticipated Ethereum ETF landscape. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is still pending, and the SEC’s cautious stance on redemption mechanisms for Bitcoin ETFs will undoubtedly influence its decisions for Ether-based products. If the SEC eventually approves in-kind redemptions for Bitcoin ETFs, it could set a precedent that smooths the path for similar structures in Ethereum ETFs. Conversely, continued delays or outright rejections could mean that all future spot crypto ETFs, including those for Ethereum, might be restricted to cash redemption models for the foreseeable future. This regulatory uncertainty can impact: Institutional Adoption: A more streamlined and tax-efficient in-kind redemption process could attract more institutional capital into the crypto space. Delays might deter some traditional finance players. Market Liquidity: In-kind redemptions can theoretically improve market liquidity by allowing APs to manage arbitrage opportunities more efficiently, directly intera",0.0,The SEC's delay on the in-kind redemption model for Bitcoin ETFs reflects regulatory caution but does not indicate major institutional adoption or significant negative sentiment.

2025-07-17 10:14:45+00:00,"The post Trusted UK Agent Caught Stealing Over 50 BTC from Seized Funds appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The rot starts from the head.” This age-old proverb rings true in a shocking case from the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA), where a former officer, Paul Chowles , was convicted of stealing a significant number of Bitcoins seized during the Silk Road 2.0 investigation. Chowles’ Role in the Infamous Silk Road 2.0 Case The Silk Road 2.0 was a notorious dark web marketplace taken down by the FBI in 2014. It had served as a successor to the original Silk Road, facilitating illegal drug sales, money laundering, and other criminal activities. One of its co-founders, Thomas White, was arrested and later sentenced to over five years in prison for a range of charges, including drug trafficking, laundering proceeds of crime, and even possessing child abuse material. As part of the investigation, at least 97 BTC were confiscated from White’s digital wallets. Chowles, then an NCA officer, was actively involved in data recovery and analysis from the seized devices. But rather than upholding the law, he ultimately chose to abuse his access. The Insider Theft That Shocked the Agency In 2017, the NCA identified that more than 50 BTC had quietly disappeared from the seized stash. Initially, investigators suspected White himself, but after strong denial from his side, attention turned inward. What followed was an internal probe that uncovered corruption in their ranks. During searches of Chowles’ properties, authorities discovered a mobile phone linked to the wallet where the stolen Bitcoin was sent.

Prosecutor Alex Johnson of the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that asset confiscation proceedings would now follow to recover the stolen funds. The scale of Chowles’ theft was staggering.

2025-07-17 10:17:20+00:00,"Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing quite a resurgence, hitting key milestones and igniting market enthusiasm. According to analytics firm Santiment, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency has surged over 50% in less than four weeks, reclaiming heights last seen in late January while boasting a record-breaking 152.03 million non-empty wallets, the most extensive active user base in crypto. Institutional Inflows, Social Buzz Fuel Ethereum Breakout The Santiment data shows that since June 22, ETH’s market value has grown by more than 50%, pushing its price above $3,400 for the first time in six months.

Numbers from the market intelligence platform show that ETH was the top trending crypto asset in the last 24 hours across X, Reddit, and Telegram, with conversations around it predominantly characterized by bullish sentiment as users set their sights on $4,000. “The crowd has taken note of the major price rebound, pouring in the highest level of discussions since a similar price rise back in May 2024,” said Santiment. This uptick seems to have been fueled by a combination of institutional accumulation and renewed investor enthusiasm following Bitcoin’s recent run to a new all-time high. On July 16, spot Ethereum ETFs shattered records, attracting more than $726 million in net investments. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the charge, registering its highest single-day inflow since launch with a $489 million haul. With Fidelity and Grayscale also reporting substantial capital entries, corporate holdings of the asset have swelled to 1.6 million ETH, valued at an estimated $5.3 billion. As noted by the Strategic Eth Reserve, accumulation is now occurring 36 times faster than new ETH issuance. Market Outlook Meanwhile, in the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency rose 10% to trade around $3,450 per data from CoinGecko. In the past seven days, its value increased by 25%, vastly outperforming Bitcoin’s 6.8% growth in the same period. More notably, SwissBlock’s recent Altcoin Vector report hinted at ETH’s growing magnetism for liquidity after noting a steady rise in the ETH/BTC ratio. The report suggests that Ethereum is now the cycle’s next leg after BTC briefly retreated to under $116,000 yesterday before bouncing back close to $119,000. The milestone of 152.03 million non-empty wallets, highlighted by Santiment, is viewed by watchers as a sign of the network’s expanding user base and fundamental health. According to the analytics platform, the mass fear of missing out (FOMO) has now shifted to ETH, with many expecting its price to hit $4,000 imminently. Others, like on-chain analyst AbramChart, suggest that the asset will fly to new all-time highs past $5,200 if BTC’s dominance decreases.

You Might Own a Piece of Everything, Says Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Can a tiny slice of Bitcoin give you a share in the world’s wealth forever? Crypto analyst and author of “The Bitcoin Thesis”, Cole Walmsley , says yes. In a widely shared tweet, Walmsley calls Bitcoin “the greatest asymmetric opportunity in human history,” arguing that even 0.01 BTC, worth about $1,195 today, could be enough to secure your long-term stake in a world that’s shifting toward a Bitcoin standard. The Big Idea: A World Priced in Bitcoin Walmsley describes what he calls a coming “monetary singularity”, which is a future where everything, from goods and services to land and technology, is priced in Bitcoin . He says Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million means that owning any amount of it today locks in a permanent share of global value. “With 0.01 BTC in your possession, you own 1/2,100,000,000 of everything that exists,” he writes. “Not just today, but forever.” With 0.01 BTC in your possession, you own 1/2,100,000,000 of all BTC, and you own 1/2,100,000,000 of everything that exists. The craziest part is that it’s not only everything that exists today, it’s 1/2,100,000,000 of everything that exists *forever.* — Cole Walmsley (@Cole_Walmsley) July 16, 2025 Here’s the Math Behind the Claim Walmsley points to an estimated $1 quadrillion in total global value. If all of it were eventually priced in BTC, your 0.01 BTC stake would equal roughly $476,190. That’s a potential upside of nearly 400x from today’s price. And that’s just based on existing global wealth, not including future growth ! So Why Is It “Asymmetric”? The core of Walmsley’s argument is simple: Bitcoin has limited downside and unlimited upside. Your potential loss is the money you invest. Your potential gain? He argues it could be infinite if Bitcoin becomes the base layer of global money. “With Bitcoin, your downside is whatever money you put into it. Your upside is infinity,” he says. Walmsley urges people to buy at least a “little” Bitcoin, just in case it works out. You could have nothing to lose and everything to gain.",0.5,The analyst's bullish perspective on Bitcoin as a long-term investment opportunity reflects minor bullish sentiment.
2025-07-17 10:30:41+00:00,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking Crypto Fear & Greed: Index Soars to 74 in ‘Greed’ Zone Are you feeling the buzz in the air? The cryptocurrency market is often a rollercoaster of emotions, and understanding the collective mood can be just as crucial as analyzing price charts. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular barometer for crypto market sentiment , has recently surged to 74, firmly planting itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This significant shift, up four points from the previous day, signals a notable improvement in investor confidence as of July 17. But what does this mean for you, and how can this index guide your journey in the dynamic world of digital assets? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? Developed by Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is an invaluable tool designed to capture the prevailing emotions in the cryptocurrency market. It quantifies sentiment on a scale from 0 to 100, where: 0-24: Extreme Fear – Investors are highly worried, often indicating a potential buying opportunity for the brave. 25-49: Fear – General anxiety in the market, but not panic. 50-74: Greed – A growing sense of optimism and a willingness to buy. 75-100: Extreme Greed – Euphoria takes over, often signaling a market correction might be on the horizon. This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated composite built from six key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive snapshot of crypto market sentiment : Factor Weighting Description Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes current volume and market momentum compared to average values. Social Media 15% Scans Twitter hashtags and mentions for crypto-related terms. Surveys 15% Weekly polls, though currently paused. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market. Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries for crypto-related terms. Decoding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does 74 Mean for Crypto? A score of 74 puts the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ territory. This indicates that investors are feeling confident, perhaps even euphoric, about current price trends and future prospects. Such a high reading suggests that recent positive price action, coupled with optimistic news or developments, has likely fueled this upward shift in sentiment. When market momentum is strong, as it appears to be now, it often encourages more participants to enter or increase their positions, hoping to capitalize on further gains. While ‘Greed’ can be a powerful driver of price increases, it’s also a double-edged sword. Historically, periods of extreme greed have sometimes preceded market corrections. It’s a classic example of investor psychology at play: when everyone is optimistic, there’s less room for new buyers, and the market can become overextended. This is why understanding the index isn’t just about celebrating highs, but also about recognizing potential risks. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance and Other Key Factors The Bitcoin dominance factor plays a crucial, albeit smaller, role in the index’s calculation. Bitcoin’s market share often reflects overall market stability and investor preference for the leading cryptocurrency. A rising Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate a flight to safety within crypto, or simply that Bitcoin is outperforming altcoins, influencing overall sentiment. While not the largest component, it provides insight into how capital is distributed across the crypto ecosystem. Beyond Bitcoin dominance and market momentum, the contributions from volatility, social media, and Google Trends paint a broader picture. High volatility can signal uncertainty, but if accompanied by strong positive price action, it might also reflect excitement. Social media buzz and increased Google searches for crypto terms often correlate with rising public interest and participation, further feeding into the ‘Greed’ sentiment. Navigating Investor Psychology: Leveraging the Index for Informed Decisions Understanding investor psychology is paramount in volatile markets like cryptocurrency. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a unique lens through which to view collective market emotions. For savvy investors, this index can be a powerful contrarian indicator: When the index is in ‘Extreme Fear’ (0-24): This might be a prime time to consider accumulating assets, as prices could be undervalued due to widespread panic. As the saying goes, “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.” When the index is in ‘Extreme Greed’ (75-100): This could be a signal to exercise caution, take some profits, or re-evaluate your portfolio’s risk exposure, as the market may be overheated. While the index is a valuable sentiment tool, it should never be the sole basis for investment decisions. Combine its insights with fundamental analysis, technical indicators, and a clear understanding of your own risk tolerance. It’s a guide, not a g",0.5,The surge in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 74 indicates a growing sense of optimism and bullish sentiment among investors.

2025-07-17 10:50:28+00:00,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Trading: James Wynn’s Audacious 40x Short Position Sparks Market Buzz In the high-stakes world of Bitcoin trading , where fortunes can be made and lost in moments, a prominent move by Hyperliquid trader James Wynn has captured the attention of the crypto community. Known for his aggressive yet calculated strategies, Wynn recently closed a highly profitable long position on Bitcoin (BTC) and immediately pivoted, opening an audacious 40x crypto short position . This bold maneuver has ignited discussions across social media and trading desks, raising questions about market sentiment and the inherent risks and rewards of extreme leveraged trading . The Genesis of a Bold Move: James Wynn’s Profit and Pivot The saga began with James Wynn successfully concluding a 40x leveraged long position on Bitcoin, a trade that culminated in a remarkable profit of $368,120. This significant gain, as reported by Onchain Lens on X, underscores Wynn’s prowess in navigating volatile crypto markets. What makes his latest move particularly compelling is the immediate shift from a bullish stance to an aggressively bearish one. After securing his profits, Wynn wasted no time in establishing a new 40x BTC short position, signaling a strong conviction about Bitcoin’s immediate future trajectory. This rapid pivot from long to short, especially with such high leverage, is a testament to the dynamic nature of crypto markets and the decisive actions some traders take. It’s not just about making a profit; it’s about anticipating market shifts and positioning oneself accordingly, even if it means going against the prevailing sentiment. Understanding Leveraged Trading: Amplifying Gains and Risks Wynn’s 40x position highlights the powerful, yet perilous, nature of leveraged trading . But what exactly does ’40x leverage’ mean, and why is it such a talked-about topic in the crypto space? What is Leveraged Trading? Leveraged trading allows traders to open positions larger than their actual capital. Essentially, you borrow funds from an exchange to amplify your potential returns. A 40x leverage means that for every $1 of your own capital, you can control $40 worth of an asset. While this can significantly boost profits, it equally magnifies potential losses. The Mechanics of Leverage: Margin: The initial capital you put up to open a leveraged position. Borrowed Funds: The additional capital provided by the exchange. Liquidation Price: A critical price point where your position is automatically closed by the exchange if the market moves too far against you, to prevent your losses from exceeding your margin. The higher the leverage, the closer your liquidation price is to your entry price. For a 40x position, even a small percentage move against the trader can lead to liquidation. This is why such high leverage is often considered extremely risky and is typically employed by experienced traders with robust risk management strategies. Why a Crypto Short Position? Deciphering Wynn’s Bearish Bet The decision by James Wynn to open a crypto short position on Bitcoin at 40x leverage speaks volumes about his current market outlook. Short selling, in essence, is a bet that an asset’s price will fall. Traders ‘short’ an asset by borrowing it, selling it at the current market price, and then hoping to buy it back later at a lower price to return it to the lender, profiting from the price difference. Reasons for Short Selling Bitcoin: Bearish Market Outlook: The most direct reason is a belief that Bitcoin’s price is due for a correction or a significant decline. Hedging: Traders might short BTC to offset potential losses in their long-term spot holdings during a market downturn. Profit from Volatility: In highly volatile markets like crypto, short selling provides an opportunity to profit from downward price movements, complementing strategies focused on upward trends. Wynn’s immediate pivot to a short position suggests he anticipates a significant downturn, or at least a temporary dip, that he believes will be substantial enough to yield considerable profit even after accounting for funding rates and trading fees associated with high leverage. Hyperliquid: The Arena for High-Stakes Trading The platform of choice for James Wynn ‘s high-leverage maneuvers is Hyperliquid . Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange known for its high liquidity, low fees, and ability to offer substantial leverage to its users. Being a decentralized platform, it appeals to traders seeking more autonomy and potentially lower counterparty risk compared to centralized exchanges. The choice of Hyperliquid underscores the growing trend of sophisticated traders utilizing DeFi platforms for advanced trading strategies. These platforms often provide the infrastructure necessary for rapid execution and high leverage, catering to a niche of experienced and aggressive traders. What are the Implications and Risks of Such a Trade?

2025-07-17 10:51:41+00:00,"The post Tether in Trouble as GENIUS Act Targets USDT- Is a Market Collapse Ahead? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While the crypto is waiting anxiously for the upcoming crypto bills to hit the space. One analyst is expecting blood on the Satoshi Street once the GENIUS Act becomes the law. In this context, crypto analyst Jacob King sounded the alarm over what he calls the “bloodiest event in Bitcoin’s modern history.” His warning centers on the potential banning of Tether (USDT) following the expected passage of the GENIUS Act, which he claims could trigger a massive collapse across the crypto market. Bitcoin is on the brink of its bloodiest event in modern history and no one is talking about it. Tether is about to be BANNED once the GENIUS Act passes the Senate. Why do you think they’ve been desperately printing USDT out of thin air, pumping prices to unsustainable all-time… — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) July 16, 2025 Tether in the Crosshairs? According to analysts, the GENIUS Act, which is gaining traction in Congress, could effectively lead to a ban on Tether, the largest stablecoin by market cap. Despite the ban fear, Tether has recently minted 160 billion USDT, marking a major milestone and reinforcing its dominance in the stablecoin market. He argues that this threat is why Tether has been “desperately printing USDT out of thin air” in recent weeks to artificially inflate crypto prices, including Bitcoin’s. Tether has long faced criticism for its lack of transparency and allegations of unbacked printing, though it has continued to deny wrongdoing. Institutional Outflows Signal Trouble King also points to a wave of record ETF outflows this week, stating that institutions are quietly exiting their Bitcoin positions. He sees this as a major red flag, suggesting that “whales are abandoning the sinking ship” while retail investors remain unaware of the looming risk. Tether Insiders Dumping Bitcoin? In a further claim, King says that Tether insiders are offloading record amounts of Bitcoin through OTC (over-the-counter) trades, distancing themselves from the fallout before it begins. If true, this could mean major players are shedding risk while keeping the market unaware of the scale of exits. A Structural Collapse? King’s core argument is that Tether is the foundation propping up Bitcoin. He estimates that 85–90% of BTC’s daily volume is dependent on USDT, which he calls “fake volume.” Without Tether, he warns, “people will realize how fake everything has been.” In his view, the crypto market is built on fragile ground, and the removal of Tether could expose the entire system to collapse. While King’s post paints a bleak scenario, it’s important to note that his views are controversial and not supported by hard evidence in this thread. Still, his warning is sparking serious debate about stablecoin regulation and the real liquidity behind crypto markets, issues that could come into sharper focus as U.S. lawmakers push forward with crypto legislation. How True is this? While the warning highlights crypto’s volatility, it also opens the door for new players like Ripple’s RLUSD to gain ground. The GENIUS Act doesn’t ban Tether outright but gives it 18–36 months to comply. Contrary to panic, ETF data shows inflows, not outflows.

Ripple’s cross-border token is among the biggest beneficiaries of this rally, having surged to well beyond $3 and close to its all-time high of $3.4. But can it finally do it now? The Rise Just look at the graph above, which paints a vivid picture of XRP’s massive run experienced lately. The asset had fallen below $2 at the end of June (not that long ago, right?) during the darkest hours of the Israel-Iran conflict. However, it quickly bounced above it and returned to a familiar ground of $2.2-$2.3, which was a tight range in which it spent most of the past few months. Fast-forward to last Wednesday, the landscape was relatively uneventful and, some might say, boring, as XRP was rangebound within this consolidation phase, with little to no indication of a clear breakout, despite some big predictions . However, the cryptocurrency market was revived as mentioned above, led by BTC’s massive $15,000 surge to a new all-time high of over $123,000. Not only did XRP follow suit, but it managed to dwarf bitcoin’s impressive gains. The largest cryptocurrency is up by 6.7% weekly, while the third-biggest has shot up by 33%. Earlier today, the asset jumped to $3.25, thus coming around 4.5% away from its January 2018 peak of $3.4 (CoinGecko data). To put things into perspective, XRP has gained over 70% since the aforementioned bottom in June (less than a month ago). Can There Be New ATH? Although impressive, this run has not been an isolated incident for XRP. Recall that the cryptocurrency rallied hard in late 2024 and early 2025, and its culmination came in January when it matched its all-time high of $3.4. However, it couldn’t keep climbing into uncharted territory despite the community’s expectations. Consequently, we decided to ask ChatGPT about the current environment and its opinion on XRP’s chances for a new record now. The AI solution noted that even though Ripple’s native token is so close to its ATH, a breach above it is not as easy and simple as some might think. This is because the $3.4 level has become a “psychological and technical ceiling for over seven years.” “XRP was rejected there in January, indicating it’s a sticky level.” On the contrary, ChatGPT listed a few favorable indicators that could propel the asset to and beyond that level. The RSI is still below 70, which means it “may still have room to move up.” Additionally, there are lots of bullish factors outside of technical analysis, such as ETF momentum , ISO 20022 update narrative, and overall market sentiment, that could lead to new peaks. If it indeed manages to break through, analysts are adamant that the next target will be around $4.80.

2025-07-17 10:52:57+00:00,"Ministers in the United Kingdom are considering a ban on cryptocurrency donations to political parties, citing concerns about traceability and the potential for foreign interference in domestic elections. Pat McFadden, a Cabinet Office minister, raised the issue on Tuesday, emphasizing the need for public trust in the funding of political activities. McFadden responded to a question from Labour party member Liam Byrne, stating that the UK should ensure its laws remain updated to safeguard the integrity of its democratic processes. “The funding of democracy is often a controversial area, but it’s very important that we know who is providing the donation, whether they are properly registered, and what the bona fides of that donation are,” McFadden noted, supporting the idea of a potential ban. Crypto Donations Raise Transparency Questions The discussion comes at a time when crypto donations have been gaining traction in the United States , with President Donald Trump openly accepting contributions in digital assets. In contrast, the UK’s cautious stance reflects a growing divide in global approaches to crypto’s role in politics. The debate in the UK intensified after Nigel Farage’s Reform UK party declared it would accept political donations in Bitcoin, becoming the first UK party to do so. Meanwhile, an anti-corruption nonprofit in the UK recently published a report warning that crypto donations could increase the risk of funds from criminal sources or foreign entities entering the political system, potentially leading to “future political interference schemes.” Both McFadden and Byrne suggested that strengthening the UK’s National Crime Agency and the Electoral Commission could help address the concerns around crypto’s influence on politics while maintaining transparency in political funding. Global Pushback on Crypto Contributions The UK joins other countries and regions that are re-evaluating crypto’s place in campaign finance. In 2022, Ireland enacted a ban on all crypto donations to political entities, aiming to protect its democracy from foreign interference while also tackling misinformation and transparency issues. In the United States, several states, including Oregon, Michigan, and North Carolina, have banned crypto donations to political campaigns due to similar concerns, despite the growing popularity of digital assets in campaign fundraising. El Salvador, which has adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, does not ban crypto donations, although civic groups there have warned about the potential for anonymous foreign or criminal influence in its elections. As crypto donations continue to rise globally , lawmakers face the challenge of closing regulatory gaps while balancing innovation with the need to protect democratic systems from opaque and potentially harmful financial influences.

The ongoing Ethereum price surge has grabbed the attention from Bitcoin’s ATH rally and triggered sentiments of altcoin season in the market. Bitcoin price dropped to below the $118K level after hitting a fresh ATH of above $123K. The global digital assets market cap surged by 1.5% over the last day to stand at $3.81 trillion. Trump buys, hacker sells According to the data shared by Lookonchain, Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial (WLF) splashed $10 million USDC to buy 3,007 ETH at an average of $3,326. The fund has been hoarding ETH since November, now sitting on 70,505 ETH worth $230 million, with a neat $7 million in paper gains. It added that from November 29, 2024, to March 5, 2025, WLF has accumulated 66,275 Ethereum (approx. worth $215 million) at an average price of $3,243.

This whale has been busy buying 88,292 ETH in the last week alone. That’s nearly $300 million drifting off exchanges. This suggests that someone’s getting ready for something big or knows something we don’t. Meanwhile, not every whale is swimming upstream as two major players have dumped a combined 178,080 ETH (approx. worth $528 million). Trend Research, which bought 184,115 ETH between February and June at $2,118 average, just cashed out 79,470 ETH for $250 million. They still hold 105,664 Ethereum.

2025-07-17 11:00:04+00:00,"Crypto exchange Coinbase has launched a new initiative with its “Base App,” aiming to broaden access to the crypto economy. Unveiled on Wednesday, this application replaces the Coinbase Wallet and is designed to merge various functionalities, including wallet, trading, payments, messaging, and social media. Built on Coinbase’s proprietary blockchain network, Base, which operates on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, the app reportedly seeks to attract a wider audience beyond traditional cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Base App Launch According to CNBC, the Base App represents an opportunity to reach consumers who may not be primarily interested in buying or trading cryptocurrencies—a critical pivot given the company’s past over-reliance on trading revenues. Related Reading: BNB Price Stalls: Struggles to Resume Gains While Altcoins Rally To support the launch of the Base App, Coinbase introduced two significant features: Base Account, an identity verification system, and Base Pay, an express checkout tool designed for payments using the Circle-issued USDC stablecoin. During the unveiling event, Alex Danco, a product manager at Shopify, highlighted that “tens of thousands” of merchants can now utilize this feature, with plans for a broader rollout in the coming months. Additionally, Shopify intends to offer 1% cash back on USDC payments made through Base, further incentivizing usage. While initial enthusiasm for the Base network has primarily attracted developers and builders, notable interest is growing among larger financial entities. Recently, JPMorgan announced its plan to launch a deposit token on the Base blockchain, showcasing the network’s potential. Ambitious Goals For Coinbase The Base App is designed to enhance monetization options and greater control over their identity and data. As part of this initiative, Coinbase plans to fund creator rewards and waive USDC transaction fees within chat features, although significant revenue generation is not expected immediately. This launch comes at a time when the broader cryptocurrency industry is experiencing a surge in new products, driven by favorable policies from the Trump administration and anticipated regulatory clarity from Congress.

2025-07-17 11:00:13+00:00,"The Singapore High Court has reversed its earlier ruling, paving the way for a WazirX revote that could lead to user crypto distribution. WazirX Given Greenlight By Court For Revote In a new post on X, Indian crypto exchange WazirX has shared details of the Singapore High Court hearing held on July 16th. The court has set aside its earlier rejection of the platform’s restructuring proposal and has approved a fast-tracked revote that could allow the exchange to open back up. WazirX closed its doors almost exactly a year ago, on July 18th, after falling prey to a notorious hack that drained it of user crypto funds amounting to $234 million. At the time, the exchange held about $500 million in its reserves, meaning almost half of its assets were wiped out. The hack was later linked with North Korean hackers part of the Lazarus Group . When the breach became known, the exchange suspended deposits and withdrawals, and to this day, these channels haven’t been reopened, although that may be about to change. WazirX has been planning a restructure through its parent company Zettai PTE LTD and during a vote, the proposal ended up finding overwhelming support from the creditors. The Singapore High Court rejected the plan during a hearing on June 4th, however, citing concerns over regulatory compliance with Singapore’s Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) and the involvement of Panama-based entity Zensui in the distribution process. The company amended the proposal and returned to court again. After the latest hearing, the Singapore High Court has now given its greenlight on the updated plan and allow the exchange to conduct a fast-tracked revote with its creditors. Alongside the news, Nischal Shetty , CEO of WazirX, has broken a long silence on X to comment on the outcome. “The broad amendment is that instead of Zettai, it will be Zanmai helping with the fund distribution if the scheme is approved,” noted Shetty. Zanmai Labs is the Indian entity behind WazirX that manages the Indian Rupee (INR) component of the platform. Zettai, on the other hand, was the one looking after the crypto side of things, which is why the firm has been at the center of the legal proceedings. The data of the vote will be announced soon, according to Shetty. “If the amended scheme is approved by the requisite majority of creditors and sanctioned by the court, it is contemplated that the WazirX platform will reopen,” said WazirX in the announcement. It now remains to be seen how things will develop from here and whether the platform’s users who have been waiting for their crypto for over a year will finally get it back.

Recently, a key indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , has dropped to 38, signaling a significant period for the market. This isn’t just a number; it’s a clear message that we are currently deep into what’s known as Bitcoin Season, a time when the king of crypto asserts its dominance over the myriad of alternative coins. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these prevailing crypto market trends ? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 38 Mean? To truly grasp the current state of the market, it’s essential to understand the metric guiding our insights: the Altcoin Season Index. This valuable tool, meticulously tracked by the cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), provides a snapshot of the broader market sentiment and asset performance. On July 17, at 00:30 UTC, the index registered a reading of 38, a figure that remained unchanged from the previous day. This low number is a direct indicator of the market’s current leanings. Here’s a breakdown of how this index works and what its current reading signifies: Exclusions: The index specifically filters out stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to provide a clearer picture of genuine market sentiment and speculative asset performance. Comparison Basis: It meticulously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap over the past 90 days. This 90-day window offers a robust view, smoothing out daily volatility to reveal underlying trends. Defining Seasons: The index has clear thresholds for determining market seasons: Altcoin Season: For the market to be declared in Altcoin Season, a remarkable 75% or more of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. This signifies broad-based altcoin strength. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. A score of 38, as we see now, falls squarely within this range, indicating that Bitcoin is largely overshadowing its smaller counterparts. Score Range: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin, and lower numbers signaling Bitcoin’s dominance. A score of 38 emphatically confirms that Bitcoin has been the dominant force, soaking up capital and attention, while most altcoins struggle to keep pace. Navigating Bitcoin Season : Why Dominance Matters When the Altcoin Season Index points towards Bitcoin Season, it’s not just an academic observation; it has tangible implications for the entire market. Bitcoin Season typically occurs for several reasons, and understanding them can help investors make more informed decisions. During a Bitcoin Season: Flight to Safety: In times of uncertainty or market consolidation, investors often view Bitcoin as the safest bet in the volatile crypto space. Its larger market capitalization, established infrastructure, and first-mover advantage make it a preferred store of value. Capital tends to flow out of riskier altcoins and into Bitcoin. Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, historically precede bull runs. The anticipation and post-halving effects often lead to Bitcoin outperforming altcoins as investors front-run or react to the supply shock. Institutional Interest: A growing number of institutional investors are entering the crypto space, and many start with Bitcoin due to its liquidity and regulatory clarity (or perceived clarity compared to altcoins). This influx of institutional capital disproportionately benefits Bitcoin. Liquidity Concentration: As Bitcoin gains momentum, trading volume often concentrates around BTC pairs, making it easier for large players to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. This further reinforces its dominance. The current Bitcoin Season means that, for the vast majority of the top 100 altcoins, their performance has lagged behind Bitcoin’s over the last three months. This isn’t necessarily a sign of weakness in altcoins themselves, but rather a reflection of Bitcoin’s superior momentum and market preference during this specific period. Analyzing Crypto Market Trends : Beyond the Index While the Altcoin Season Index provides a quantitative measure, it’s crucial to look at broader crypto market trends to understand the full picture. The index is a symptom, not the sole cause, of market dynamics. Several macroeconomic and industry-specific factors contribute to the current state of Bitcoin dominance. Consider these overarching trends: Global Economic Headwinds: High inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions can lead investors to de-risk. In the crypto space, this often transla",0.0,The Altcoin Season Index at 38 indicates Bitcoin's dominance but does not reflect major institutional adoption or significant market changes.
