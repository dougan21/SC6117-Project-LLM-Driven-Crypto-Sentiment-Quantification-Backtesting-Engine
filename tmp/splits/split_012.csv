2025-07-24 04:19:06+00:00,"Ether, XRP Trades Book Bigger Losses Than Bitcoin as Bulls See $680M Liquidations","A sharp pullback across crypto markets on Tuesday triggered nearly $735 million in liquidations with bulls bearing the brunt. Ether (ETH) and XRP tracked futures bets booked larger losses than bitcoin in an unusual move, indicative of the higher interest toward altcoin traders in the past week. CoinGlass data shows ETH traders lost $152.78 million, the largest for any asset, followed by $88.58 million in liquidations for XRP. Bitcoin came in third at $65.29 million, despite its larger market cap and deeper liquidity. While price action across the majors was mostly down by only a few percentage points, the high leverage used by retail traders in altcoins likely amplified their losses. In total, $625.5 million of the liquidations were on long positions, suggesting the selloff caught many bulls off guard after weeks of upward momentum. Other heavily hit tokens included Solana’s SOL at $41 million, dogecoin (DOGE) at $40 million, and smaller DeFi tokens like SPK and PUMP seeing over $10 million in positions wiped. The absence of a clear catalyst and profit-taking near key resistance levels may have exacerbated the selloff. Ether had recently flirted with the $4,000 mark while Bitcoin traded above $118,000 — levels that had already prompted profit booking from larger wallets. As of writing, ETH is down roughly 3.6% on the day to trade near $3,540, while XRP fell 6% to $3.25, extending its weekly loss to over 12%. Bitcoin fared better, slipping just under 2% to hover around $116,800. Crypto liquidations occur when leveraged positions are forcibly closed due to a price move beyond a trader’s margin threshold. This typically results in major losses and can trigger cascade effects during volatile moves. Traders use liquidation data to gauge market sentiment and positioning. Large long liquidations often signal panic bottoms, while short liquidations may precede a squeeze. Spikes in liquidations also help identify overcrowded trades and potential reversals. When paired with open interest and funding rate data, liquidation metrics can offer strategic entry or exit points, especially in overleveraged markets prone to sudden flushes or rallies.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/24/ether-xrp-trades-book-bigger-losses-than-bitcoin-as-bulls-see-usd680m-liquidations,BTC|MARKET|XRP|TRADING|ETH,Markets|Trading|Markets|News,BTC,"Ether, XRP Trades Book Bigger Losses Than Bitcoin as Bulls See $680M Liquidations.

Recently, the crypto community witnessed one such significant event: the Bitcoin price experienced a notable dip, falling below the critical $118,000 mark. This development has naturally sparked widespread discussion and analysis among market participants. For anyone deeply invested in or simply observing the digital asset space, understanding the nuances of such movements is paramount. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC has traded as low as $117,999.26 on the Binance USDT market. This specific price point, while seemingly just a number, carries considerable psychological weight for traders and investors alike, signaling a shift in immediate market sentiment. What does this mean for the broader crypto landscape, and more importantly, for your investment strategy? Let’s delve into the details and uncover the layers behind this recent Bitcoin price action. What Just Happened to the Bitcoin Price? The recent drop in Bitcoin price below $118,000 marks a significant moment for the market. Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth over its lifetime. However, it is also known for its inherent volatility. This particular dip, as reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, saw BTC trading at $117,999.26 on the Binance USDT market. Such precise figures highlight the immediate impact on trading platforms where millions of transactions occur daily. When Bitcoin breaches key psychological or technical support levels, it often triggers a cascade of reactions. For many traders, $118,000 was a significant threshold, and its breach can lead to increased selling pressure as automated trading systems and individual investors react to the breakdown of this support. This event is not isolated; it is part of the continuous ebb and flow of the digital asset market, influenced by a multitude of factors that we will explore further. Understanding these immediate reactions is crucial for interpreting the broader market narrative surrounding the Bitcoin price . Why Did the Bitcoin Price Experience This Dip? Understanding the forces behind a sudden dip in Bitcoin price is essential for any informed investor. Cryptocurrency markets are complex, influenced by a confluence of macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and unique market dynamics. Here are some of the primary reasons that might contribute to such a downturn: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic indicators, such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions, often have a ripple effect on risk assets like cryptocurrencies. When traditional markets show signs of instability or a shift towards risk-off sentiment, investors tend to pull capital from more volatile assets, including Bitcoin. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory pressure or uncertainty from governmental bodies worldwide can dampen investor enthusiasm. News of potential bans, stricter compliance measures, or legal actions against crypto entities can lead to widespread fear and selling pressure, directly impacting the Bitcoin price . Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence market movements. A substantial sell-off by a few major players can create a ripple effect, pushing the price down rapidly, especially if market liquidity is thin. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: Traders often rely on technical indicators and support/resistance levels. When a significant support level, like $118,000, is broken, it can trigger stop-loss orders and prompt further selling by technical traders, accelerating the downward momentum of the Bitcoin price . Market Sentiment and FUD: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) can spread quickly in the crypto space, often amplified by social media. Negative news, rumors, or even a general sense of pessimism can lead to panic selling, regardless of underlying fundamentals. It is important to note that often, a combination of these factors contributes to significant price movements rather than a single isolated event. The interconnectedness of global finance means that even seemingly unrelated events can influence the Bitcoin price . What Does This Bitcoin Price Volatility Mean for Investors? The recent volatility in Bitcoin price , specifically its dip below $118,000, can evoke a range of emotions and reactions among investors. For some, it’s a cause for concern, while for others, it presents a strategic opportunity.

2025-07-24 05:00:09+00:00,Goldman Sachs Partners With BNY Mellon To Bring $7 Trillion Money Market To Crypto,"The growing intersection between traditional finance and digital asset infrastructure has taken another step forward, as Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon announced a joint initiative aimed at integrating blockchain technology into the money market fund (MMF) ecosystem. The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain . The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. Blockchain Integration to Expand MMF Utility The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. A Step Toward Collateral Utility and Global Scalability Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.

The collaboration will see BNY Mellon leverage Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP® (also known as its private blockchain) to maintain a mirrored tokenized record of customer ownership in select MMFs. This marks the first instance in the United States where mirrored tokenization will be used to reflect ownership in MMFs through a blockchain-based ledger. The rollout includes major asset managers such as BlackRock, BNY Mellon Investment Management’s Dreyfus, Federated Hermes, Fidelity Investments, and Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Investors will now be able to subscribe to and redeem MMF shares using BNY’s Liquidity management platform, which has been integrated with its digital assets platform to connect with the private blockchain . The mirror tokens created on the Goldman Sachs’ private blockchain platform do not replace official records but serve as a complementary layer that increases the accessibility and potential use cases of MMF shares in a digitized financial ecosystem. Blockchain Integration to Expand MMF Utility The mirrored tokenization of MMF shares using blockchain represents a new model for fund management infrastructure. Although the underlying assets remain managed through traditional custodial and compliance channels, the blockchain layer enhances interoperability and real-time transferability. Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP®, is built on smart contract technology from the startup Digital Asset and offers programmable finance functionality for institutions. BNY Mellon’s LiquidityDirectSM platform is also one of the leading portals for institutional cash investors, and the integration of the private blockchain opens the door to extending MMF shares into use cases like collateral optimization and intraday liquidity management. According to Laide Majiyagbe, BNY Mellon’s Global Head of Liquidity, Financing and Collateral, “Mirrored tokenization of MMF shares is a first step in this transition,” noting the company’s position as a link between established financial systems and new technology. GS DAP® was previously piloted for bond issuance on blockchain networks in Asia and Europe. Its adaptation for MMF share representation in the US signals a broader vision for tokenizing real-world assets beyond equities and debt, potentially reshaping capital markets infrastructure. This particular use case focuses on liquidity and settlement efficiency in short-term investment vehicles, valued at over $7 trillion globally, according to ICI data. A Step Toward Collateral Utility and Global Scalability Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the potential benefits of using tokenized MMF shares as collateral in various trading and settlement contexts. “Using tokens representing the value of shares of Money Market Funds on GS DAP® would enable us to unlock their utility as a form of collateral and open up more seamless transferability in the future,” he said in a statement. BNY Mellon will continue to serve as the official recordkeeper, maintaining existing regulatory compliance and settlement protocols. However, the addition of tokenized mirrors creates new flexibility for financial institutions seeking to modernize collateral management and liquidity strategies. While this initiative currently focuses on US MMFs, both institutions signaled interest in expanding the model globally, potentially applying similar technology to other fund structures and asset classes.

2025-07-24 05:00:59+00:00,Are Traders Walking Into a Bitcoin Bull Trap at $118K? Here’s What the Data Shows,"Bitcoin’s recent price action reflects a consolidation phase rather than a decisive move in either direction. After briefly touching an all-time high of over $123,000 earlier this month, BTC has seen a gradual pullback, currently trading around $118,000 at the time of writing. This represents a 1.1% drop in the last 24 hours and a 3.9% decline from its peak, as traders evaluate whether the current market structure suggests a continuation or a correction. According to new insights from CryptoQuant contributors, indicators present a split narrative. Some metrics suggest rising optimism among traders, while others indicate a more cautious and holding-focused environment. Related Reading: Trump Shares Viral Bitcoin Breakdown — Here’s What He Posted Surge in Long Positions Raises Contrarian Concerns CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest highlighted a notable spike in the long/short sentiment ratio on Binance, showing a growing preference among traders for long positions. This metric, which tracks the volume of long versus short positions on the exchange, has tilted significantly bullish within the $116,000–$120,000 price range. He noted that during Bitcoin’s previous consolidation between $100,000 and $110,000, sentiment leaned toward short positions, a setup that preceded a breakout to the upside and a wave of short liquidations. This time, however, the environment has flipped. BorisVest explained: Now that sentiment is skewed heavily toward longs, the same principle could apply in reverse. When the majority positions in one direction, it often creates a setup for the opposite move. The current range is acting as a trap zone, where traders’ expectations are repeatedly tested. The historical tendency for sentiment extremes to precede contrary price action has prompted some analysts to advise caution, suggesting that growing bullish bias could lead to a temporary reversal if met with enough liquidity pressure. Bitcoin Exchange Flow Patterns Reflect Investor Patience While Binance sentiment data leans bullish, another key on-chain indicator paints a different picture. CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain examined the Bitcoin Flow Pulse (IFP) indicator, which tracks BTC movements to centralized exchanges. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Defend This Key Support For $180,000 Year-End Target, Analyst Says According to the data, despite Bitcoin’s recent high above $120,000, there has not been a corresponding spike in exchange inflows, suggesting that investors are not rushing to take profits or exit the market. This behavior contrasts with historical cycles in 2017 and 2021, where price peaks were accompanied by large exchange inflows and followed by corrections.

2025-07-24 05:03:59+00:00,XRP Price Prediction For July 24,"The post XRP Price Prediction For July 24 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently showing signs of weakness after its recent rally, and technical signals show that the token could be preparing for a deeper pullback. While the price remains above important support levels, chart patterns and broader market conditions are flashing early warning signs. Bearish Divergence on the Weekly Chart On the weekly timeframe, a bearish divergence is forming. While XRP’s price has made higher highs, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is printing lower highs. This kind of divergence is often a hint that momentum is slowing down. Although this signal hasn’t been confirmed yet, if it does in the coming weeks or months, XRP may face a stronger correction. According to analyst Josh of Crypto World, support lies around the $3.00 mark, while the next major resistance is between $4.60 and $4.70. These zones are based on Fibonacci levels, which are commonly used to predict where prices could reverse. Daily Chart Shows Breakdown Signs On the daily chart, XRP is struggling to hold the $3.30–$3.40 range, which recently acted as strong support. If the price closes below $3.30 and fails to recover, this could confirm a bearish shift in short-term trend. In that case, XRP may head toward $3.00 or even $2.95. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level around $2.95 is a critical support area during market corrections. If this level holds, XRP could bounce. But if the price drops below $2.75 and then $2.65, a retest of April’s lows becomes possible. Broader Market Impact XRP is not alone. Ethereum is facing resistance and showing short-term bearish divergence, while Bitcoin struggles to break higher. Bitcoin dominance has also ticked upward, often a bearish signal for altcoins. This overall market pressure is affecting XRP’s outlook in the near term. For now, XRP needs to hold above $2.75 to keep hopes of a continued rally alive.

A significant development has recently captured the attention of both seasoned investors and curious newcomers: Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF has achieved a truly remarkable feat, surpassing an astonishing $5 billion in assets under management (AUM) in less than a year since its launch on July 31, 2024. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the growing mainstream acceptance and institutional confidence in the digital asset space, particularly within the burgeoning Bitcoin ETF market. What does this phenomenal growth signify for the future of crypto investments? What is the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF and Why Does it Matter? Understanding the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF is key to appreciating this achievement. This particular Bitcoin ETF emerged from Grayscale’s strategic efforts to offer a more streamlined and competitive product in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Launched on July 31, 2024, this trust was designed to provide investors with a straightforward way to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. Key aspects that make this Bitcoin ETF significant include: Simplified Access: It allows traditional investors to access Bitcoin through regulated brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of direct crypto purchases and storage. Institutional Backing: As a product from Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, it carries a level of credibility and trust that appeals to institutional and retail investors alike. Diversification Potential: For many, it represents an opportunity to diversify traditional portfolios with digital assets, harnessing Bitcoin’s growth potential. Liquidity and Transparency: Traded on major exchanges, it offers the liquidity and transparency typically associated with traditional exchange-traded funds. The swift accumulation of over $5 billion in AUM underscores a clear demand for regulated, accessible Bitcoin investment vehicles. The Phenomenal Growth of the Bitcoin ETF Landscape The success of the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF isn’t an isolated incident; it’s a reflection of a much larger trend: the explosive growth and increasing maturity of the entire Bitcoin ETF landscape. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions has been a game-changer, opening the floodgates for a new wave of capital into the crypto market. This shift marks a pivotal moment for several reasons: Mainstream Adoption: ETFs bridge the gap between traditional finance and cryptocurrency, making Bitcoin investment accessible to a wider audience, including large institutional players who previously faced regulatory hurdles. Regulatory Clarity: The existence of regulated Bitcoin ETFs provides a level of legitimacy and security that was once missing from the crypto space, fostering greater investor confidence. Reduced Barrier to Entry: Investors no longer need to navigate crypto exchanges, set up digital wallets, or worry about private key management. Investing in a Bitcoin ETF is as simple as buying shares of a stock. This surge in interest and investment through ETF vehicles signals a significant step towards Bitcoin becoming a widely accepted asset class in conventional financial portfolios. Driving Forces Behind the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF’s Success Several powerful factors have converged to propel the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF to its impressive $5 billion AUM milestone. This success is not merely coincidental; it’s a strategic alignment of market dynamics, investor sentiment, and Grayscale’s established presence. Grayscale’s Brand Recognition: As one of the earliest and largest digital asset managers, Grayscale has built significant trust and brand loyalty within the crypto community.

Growing Institutional Appetite: Large institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are increasingly looking to diversify their portfolios with digital assets. The regulated structure of an ETF provides the compliance framework they require. Favorable Market Conditions: The period leading up to and following the launch of various spot Bitcoin ETFs has generally seen renewed optimism in the crypto market, driven by factors such as the Bitcoin halving event and increasing global recognition of digital assets.

This mismatch is frustrating for investors and may be one reason why Bitcoin’s price dipped slightly today , as people worry about more coins hitting the market and what that could mean for prices. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

As such, it has caused substantial losses to over-leveraged traders, even more than BTC. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView What goes up, must come down, right? This narrative proved correct for Ripple’s cross-border token, which was in an ‘up only’ mode for over a week. Recall that the asset broke out of its consolidation range ($2.2-$2.3) where it spent a month or so last week and shot up above $3 in days. The bulls kept the pressure on and, after more than seven years, XRP made history by breaking above its January 2018 all-time high of $3.4, and it set a new record at over $3.65. Thus, the cryptocurrency had gained more than 50% in a week or so, and its market cap flew past the $200 billion mark. What followed were a few days of sideways trading between the previous and the latest ATHs. However, the bears took control in the past 12 hours or so, pushing XRP south hard. In a matter of hours, the third-largest cryptocurrency plummeted from almost $3.6 to under $3.05, losing roughly 15% of its value. Although it has recovered some ground since then, it’s still down by over 11% daily. This sudden but painful drop has resulted in a lot of pain for over-leveraged traders who were long on XRP.

Bessent announced details of the trade agreement with Japan. The agreement will implement a new 15% tariff on automobiles and will see Japan create an innovative financing mechanism to provide capital to strategic US industries. He noted that ongoing negotiations with the European Union are progressing slowly due to the “problem of joint action” among the 27 member states. The minister said he hoped to move beyond issues like rare earths and export controls to focus on “bigger discussions” at his meeting with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm. Bessent spoke of the potential for a “big, beautiful rebalancing” where the US focuses on production and China on consumption. He also suggested that a new purchasing agreement similar to the Phase One agreement from the previous administration is possible.

2025-07-24 05:30:00+00:00,Mara Holdings Plans $1B Note Sale to Buy More Bitcoin,"The offering includes $850 million due in 2032 and a $150 million optional extension. The company intends to use the proceeds to repurchase existing debt, execute capped call transactions, buy more Bitcoin, and support general operations. This latest offering follows a $2 billion stock sale plan that was announced earlier this year and the recent acquisition of a minority stake in institutional advisor Two Prime. With 50,000 BTC, Mara is now the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Meanwhile, a growing number of more traditional companies from various industries are adding crypto to their treasuries, though analysts warn of high risks, especially for firms holding altcoins. Mara Ramps Up Bitcoin Push Mara Holdings, one of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies, announced that it plans to offer up to $1 billion in convertible senior notes as the next step in its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The offering includes $850 million in notes due in 2032, which will be available to qualified institutional buyers. Additionally, these buyers will have the option to purchase an extra $150 million in principal, bringing the total potential raise to $1 billion. According to the company, a portion of the proceeds—up to $50 million—will be used to repurchase part of its outstanding 1.00% convertible senior notes due in 2026. The remainder of the capital is expected to fund capped call transactions, purchase more Bitcoin, and support general corporate initiatives. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Mara Holdings, and will not bear interest. However, the offer remains subject to prevailing market and other conditions. This means that there is no guarantee the deal will be completed or finalized under the current terms. Press release (Source: MARA Holdings ) This debt offering is the latest in a series of strategic financial maneuvers by the company that are specifically aimed at scaling its Bitcoin reserves and mining operations. In late March, Mara disclosed plans to sell up to $2 billion in stock “from time to time” through agreements with institutional investors, with proceeds primarily used for expanding its Bitcoin holdings. The announcement was also made after the company''s recent acquisition of a minority stake in Two Prime , an institutional investment advisor managing $1.75 billion in assets. This deal effectively boosted the amount of Bitcoin managed on Mara’s behalf. Additionally, Mara’s mining operations showed some remarkable growth. The company increased its Bitcoin production by 35% in May despite heightened mining difficulty and rising hashrates. Its annualized mining revenue recently surpassed $752 million, a new record. Mara Bitcoin holdings over time (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Currently, Mara Holdings holds 50,000 BTC , making it the second-largest corporate Bitcoin holder after Strategy, which holds an industry-leading 607,000 BTC. Crypto Treasuries Rise, But Risks Mount A growing wave of more traditional companies are beginning to incorporate digital assets into their corporate treasury strategies. This is very likely due to the shift in how businesses perceive the role of cryptocurrencies in financial management. This trend gained a lot of momentum, with firms across a wide range of industries—from agriculture to textiles—announcing crypto allocations this week alone. Among them, agricultural technology company Nature’s Miracle revealed that it will allocate up to $20 million to XRP. On the same day, consumer manufacturing firm Upexi disclosed it acquired 83,000 Solana (SOL) tokens, worth approximately $16.7 million, for its corporate reserve. A day earlier, Kitabo , a Japanese company that was founded nearly 80 years ago and known for its work in textiles and recycling, announced plans to purchase around $5.6 million in Bitcoin. Press release from Upexi These moves are part of the broader trend driven by the growing appeal of digital assets as a hedge or diversification strategy in treasury portfolios. Bitcoin is often seen as the anchor asset in this trend, and still attracts attention from publicly listed companies. However, analysts warn that while the allure of digital asset holdings is strong, it still comes with big risks. According to a report from venture capital firm Breed, only a small number of Bitcoin treasury companies are expected to survive long-term. The report warns that even minor declines in Bitcoin’s price could trigger a cascade of forced sales among overleveraged firms, which could lead to a feedback loop of declining prices and reduced access to corporate credit. This “death spiral” scenario is seen as a key systemic risk. Crypto treasury ‘death spiral’ (Source: Breed ) The situation is even more precarious for companies holding altcoins, which often experience extreme drawdowns of up to 90% between cycles and lack the long-term floor that Bitcoin tends to have.

2025-07-24 06:10:23+00:00,Unveiling the Crucial Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios: A 24-Hour Deep Dive,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Crucial Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios: A 24-Hour Deep Dive In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, understanding market sentiment is paramount. Price movements in assets like Bitcoin (BTC) are often driven not just by fundamentals, but by the collective mood of traders. One of the most powerful indicators for gauging this sentiment, especially in the derivatives market, is the Bitcoin long-short ratios . These ratios offer a unique window into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they are betting on a price increase (long) or a price decrease (short). What Do Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios Truly Reveal About Market Sentiment? At its core, a long-short ratio is a simple yet profound metric. It represents the proportion of long positions versus short positions held by traders on a given exchange or across the market. When we talk about Bitcoin long-short ratios for perpetual futures, we’re looking at contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without an expiry date, making them highly popular for continuous trading strategies. Long Positions: These are taken by traders who believe the price of Bitcoin will increase. They buy contracts with the expectation of selling them at a higher price later. Short Positions: Conversely, these are opened by traders who anticipate a decrease in Bitcoin’s price. They sell borrowed contracts with the intention of buying them back at a lower price. The Ratio’s Significance: A ratio above 1 (or more longs than shorts) suggests a generally bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 (more shorts than longs) indicates a bearish outlook. It’s a direct snapshot of the market’s collective conviction. Monitoring these ratios provides valuable insight into the prevailing market psychology. Are traders feeling optimistic or pessimistic? This data can often precede significant price movements, making it a critical tool for astute investors. Dissecting the Latest 24-Hour Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios Data Let’s delve into the most recent 24-hour data for Bitcoin long-short ratios across major cryptocurrency exchanges. This snapshot offers a compelling look at how traders are currently positioning themselves in the BTC perpetual futures market. 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios: Category Long Positions Short Positions Total Market 48.89% 51.11% The aggregate data reveals a slight lean towards short positions, with 51.11% of traders betting on a price decline compared to 48.89% anticipating a rise. This indicates a marginally bearish sentiment prevailing across the entire perpetual futures market for Bitcoin over the last day. While not a dramatic imbalance, it suggests that more traders are expecting a downward movement or are hedging against potential losses. Exchange-Specific Insights: A Deeper Dive into Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios While the total market ratio gives us a broad overview, examining individual exchanges provides a more nuanced understanding. Trader demographics, regional biases, and even specific platform features can influence the sentiment on different exchanges. Here’s how the top three exchanges compare for Bitcoin long-short ratios : Top Three Exchanges – 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios: Exchange Long Positions Short Positions Binance 48.67% 51.33% Bybit 47.26% 52.74% Gate.io 52.35% 47.65% Key Observations: Binance and Bybit: Both show a similar trend to the overall market, with a slight majority of traders holding short positions. Bybit, in particular, exhibits the highest proportion of shorts among the three, suggesting a more pronounced bearish outlook among its user base. Given their massive user bases and trading volumes, the sentiment on these platforms significantly contributes to the overall market perception. Gate.io: In contrast, Gate.io stands out with a majority of long positions (52.35%). This divergence is fascinating. It could imply a different regional trader base, a unique set of market participants, or perhaps a delayed reaction to broader market sentiment. For traders, this highlights the importance of not just looking at aggregate data but also considering the nuances of individual platforms where they might be active. These variations underscore that while overall market sentiment is important, the specific dynamics within different trading ecosystems can offer unique opportunities or risks. Understanding these differences can help traders refine their strategies and avoid being blindsided by localized sentiment shifts. How Can Traders Strategically Utilize Bitcoin Long-Short Ratios ?

2025-07-24 06:10:47+00:00,Bitcoin Volatility Index and the S&P 500 VIX Boast Record 90-Day Correlation,"New statistical evidence has emerged, suggesting that bitcoin''s (BTC) market dynamics are now intricately linked to the ebb and flow on Wall Street. Recently, the 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin''s 30-day implied volatility indices – Volmex''s BVIV and Deribit''s DVOL – and the S&P 500 VIX hit a record high of 0.88, according to data source TradingView. A positive correlation of 0.88 indicates that the two variables are closely tied. As of Wednesday, the correlation stood at 0.75. The VIX represents the 30-day implied or expected price turbulence in Wall Street''s equity index, the S&P 500. The strengthening correlation suggests that BTC''s implied volatility indices are evolving into fear gauges, similar to the VIX, which typically falls during bull runs and rises during sell-offs. The BVIV has crashed from roughly 67% to 42% this year, moving in the opposite direction of BTC''s price, which has risen by 26%. Historically, BTC and its implied volatility tended to move in tandem. Meanwhile, the VIX has dropped 11% this year, while the S&P 500 index has gained over 8%. According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, growing institutional participation in the crypto market, characterized by volatility sellers, is behind the collapse in BTC implied volatility and the resulting record correlation with the VIX. Volatility selling involves writing out-of-the-money (OTM) calls to generate an additional income on top of the spot market holdings. Some traders also write OTM puts. ""This bitcoin cycle continues to be dominated by Wall Street participants, who are actively compressing volatility,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. ""Rather than speculating directionally, many institutional players are selling call options to generate additional yield—mirroring traditional equity income strategies. As a result, directional flows tend to follow broader risk-on/risk-off dynamics familiar to legacy markets,"" Thielen added. Thielen added that the institutional framework has contributed to BTC''s growing correlation with the U.S. equities, ""particularly as hedge funds and asset managers increasingly apply the same macro playbook across both asset classes.""

2025-07-24 06:36:15+00:00,"Google’s AI Gemini Predicts the Price of XRP, Cardano, TOKEN6900 by End of 2025","The post Google’s AI Gemini Predicts the Price of XRP, Cardano, TOKEN6900 by End of 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin and Ethereum down 1% today, the top altcoins have taken a notable hit. XRP and Cardano are each down by over 4%, and the industry’s 24-hour trading volume has declined by 13%. However, the broader market trend remains strongly bullish. Both XRP and Cardano are up over 10% this week and significantly more so this month. Therefore, we asked Google’s AI Gemini to forecast whether the uptrends will continue and how far these projects can go in 2025. Gemini responded by predicting huge price appreciation for both projects, although it backed emerging meme coin TOKEN6900 for an even bigger gain of up to 22x. Let’s dig deeper into each of these predictions and find out why Gemini is so bullish on these three tokens. XRP Tipped to Hit Highs of $26.5 Gemini says that XRP’s outlook is contingent on a range of bullish catalysts. Firstly, Gemini highlights the ongoing regulatory demystification in the United States. The approval of the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act certainly helped last week. Now, Congress will begin building on these acts with additional regulatory frameworks. In turn, this provides a clearer picture of what’s allowed and what’s not, enabling institutions and banks to increase their participation in the crypto industry, thereby bolstering the potential for XRP adoption. Beyond that, ETF approvals, broader market performance, and whale accumulation could contribute to the project’s growth. As to how far XRP could go, Gemini eyes a “conservative target” of $5.5. Its bullish estimate ranges between $7 and $10, and its “highly optimistic scenario” predicts a price of $26.5. It says this would require a perfect storm of Bitcoin reaching $250,000 and “unprecedented institutional capital inflows” through XRP ETFs. Trending Meme Coin TOKEN6900 Set for 22X Gain, Says Gemini TOKEN6900 is an early-stage cryptocurrency presale that has raised $1 million so far, demonstrating strong demand and, consequently, significant price potential. Gemini says that this is due to the project’s use case, which aims to replicate the success of SPX6900 through collective meme-fueled delusion. SPX6900 has delivered a 7,500% gain this year, signalling that there is massive potential for TOKEN6900. “The project explicitly positions itself as a ‘non-utility’ token, embracing satire and internet meme culture, a distinct approach within the cryptocurrency market,” explains Gemini. Gemini says that factors such as community hype, market momentum, exchange listings, and links to SPX6900 could create big gains once it hits exchanges. As to how far it could go, Gemini forecasts an average target of $0.15, marking a 22x gain from its current presale rate. It says this would represent “a successful, albeit speculative, run fueled by community and market dynamics.” Even in a more neutral scenario, Gemini says TOKEN6900 could hit $0.03, marking a 4.4x gain from today’s price.

Currently priced at $0.82, Gemini suggests that $ADA could reach highs of $3.50 this year, fueled by “extremely favorable” market conditions and increased adoption. The chatbot notes that Cardano continues to see increased usage of its DeFi ecosystem, with its total value locked (TVL) steadily rising. It also notes that network upgrades and brewing institutional appetite contribute to a bullish outlook. Moreover, Gemini notes that a substantial 67.3% of $ADA coins are staked, placing upward pressure on the price due to a lack of available supply on exchanges. It also says that this “reinforces network security and decentralization.” While $3.5 is Gemini’s most optimistic forecast, its neutral outlook still anticipates impressive gains, targeting $1.5 this year. That’s almost double its current price.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/googles-ai-gemini-predicts-price-of-xrp-cardano-token6900-by-end-of-2025/,TRADING|ADA|XRP|MARKET|BTC,Press Release,BTC,"Google’s AI Gemini Predicts the Price of XRP, Cardano, TOKEN6900 by End of 2025. The post Google’s AI Gemini Predicts the Price of XRP, Cardano, TOKEN6900 by End of 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin and Ethereum down 1% today, the top altcoins have taken a notable hit. XRP and Cardano are each down by over 4%, and the industry’s 24-hour trading volume has declined by 13%. However, the broader market trend remains strongly bullish. Both XRP and Cardano are up over 10% this week and significantly more so this month. Therefore, we asked Google’s AI Gemini to forecast whether the uptrends will continue and how far these projects can go in 2025. Gemini responded by predicting huge price appreciation for both projects, although it backed emerging meme coin TOKEN6900 for an even bigger gain of up to 22x. Let’s dig deeper into each of these predictions and find out why Gemini is so bullish on these three tokens. XRP Tipped to Hit Highs of $26.5 Gemini says that XRP’s outlook is contingent on a range of bullish catalysts. Firstly, Gemini highlights the ongoing regulatory demystification in the United States. The approval of the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act certainly helped last week. Now, Congress will begin building on these acts with additional regulatory frameworks. In turn, this provides a clearer picture of what’s allowed and what’s not, enabling institutions and banks to increase their participation in the crypto industry, thereby bolstering the potential for XRP adoption. Beyond that, ETF approvals, broader market performance, and whale accumulation could contribute to the project’s growth. As to how far XRP could go, Gemini eyes a “conservative target” of $5.5. Its bullish estimate ranges between $7 and $10, and its “highly optimistic scenario” predicts a price of $26.5. It says this would require a perfect storm of Bitcoin reaching $250,000 and “unprecedented institutional capital inflows” through XRP ETFs. Trending Meme Coin TOKEN6900 Set for 22X Gain, Says Gemini TOKEN6900 is an early-stage cryptocurrency presale that has raised $1 million so far, demonstrating strong demand and, consequently, significant price potential. Gemini says that this is due to the project’s use case, which aims to replicate the success of SPX6900 through collective meme-fueled delusion. SPX6900 has delivered a 7,500% gain this year, signalling that there is massive potential for TOKEN6900. “The project explicitly positions itself as a ‘non-utility’ token, embracing satire and internet meme culture, a distinct approach within the cryptocurrency market,” explains Gemini. Gemini says that factors such as community hype, market momentum, exchange listings, and links to SPX6900 could create big gains once it hits exchanges. As to how far it could go, Gemini forecasts an average target of $0.15, marking a 22x gain from its current presale rate. It says this would represent “a successful, albeit speculative, run fueled by community and market dynamics.” Even in a more neutral scenario, Gemini says TOKEN6900 could hit $0.03, marking a 4.4x gain from today’s price.

2025-07-24 06:40:15+00:00,Bitcoin Interest: Unlock Revolutionary Yields with Bifrost’s BTCFi Boost,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Interest: Unlock Revolutionary Yields with Bifrost’s BTCFi Boost For many years, the dream of earning passive income from cryptocurrency, especially from the king coin Bitcoin, remained just that—a dream for most. While various platforms offered ways to generate yield, they often came with complexities: navigating multiple sites, dealing with wrapped assets, or repeatedly signing transactions. But what if there was a simpler, more direct way to earn Bitcoin interest on your native BTC? Enter Bifrost’s BTCFi Boost, a game-changing service designed to revolutionize how you grow your Bitcoin holdings. What is BTCFi Boost and How Does it Supercharge Your Bitcoin Interest ? Bifrost, a prominent multichain middleware platform, recently unveiled BTCFi Boost, a groundbreaking crypto deposit service. This innovative offering is specifically designed to enable users to earn interest directly on their native Bitcoin (BTC), eliminating the usual headaches associated with DeFi protocols or centralized lending platforms. No more converting your BTC to wrapped versions, no more jumping between different interfaces, and crucially, no more endless transaction approvals. At its core, BTCFi Boost simplifies the process of generating yield from your idle Bitcoin. Here’s how it works and what makes it unique: Native Bitcoin Deposits: Unlike many DeFi solutions that require Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) or other synthetic assets, BTCFi Boost allows you to deposit your actual, native BTC. This significantly reduces complexity and potential risks associated with asset wrapping. Seamless User Experience: The platform is built for simplicity. Users can deposit their Bitcoin and start earning interest without needing to navigate complex dApps or execute multiple, confusing transactions. The entire process is streamlined to be as user-friendly as possible. Multichain Middleware Advantage: Bifrost’s position as a multichain middleware platform means it can facilitate these operations across various blockchain networks, providing flexibility and broader access for users looking to earn Bitcoin interest . Automated Yield Generation: Once deposited, your Bitcoin automatically begins to accrue interest, allowing you to earn passive income without constant management. This service marks a significant step towards making passive income generation more accessible and less intimidating for the average Bitcoin holder. Why Earning Bitcoin Interest Matters: The Power of Passive Income In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, simply holding assets, while potentially profitable, doesn’t always maximize your investment’s potential. Earning Bitcoin interest transforms your idle holdings into productive assets, offering several compelling benefits: Compounding Growth: Just like traditional finance, the magic of compounding applies here. The interest you earn can itself start earning interest, accelerating your wealth accumulation over time. Inflation Hedge: While Bitcoin is often seen as an inflation hedge on its own, earning interest further strengthens its position against the erosion of purchasing power. Your Bitcoin isn’t just sitting there; it’s actively working to grow your portfolio. Diversified Income Streams: For many, earning interest on crypto adds a crucial passive income stream, reducing reliance on active trading or volatile market swings for gains. Maximizing Capital Efficiency: Instead of letting your valuable Bitcoin sit stagnant in a wallet, putting it to work through services like BTCFi Boost ensures your capital is always generating returns. This approach aligns with sound financial principles, encouraging long-term growth and strategic asset management. The Bifrost Advantage: Simplifying Your Bitcoin Interest Journey Bifrost’s BTCFi Boost isn’t just another platform offering crypto yields; it’s designed with a keen understanding of user pain points in mind. The core advantages lie in its commitment to simplicity, security, and accessibility, which are crucial for building trust and ensuring a positive user experience. Consider the typical challenges faced by users trying to earn yield on Bitcoin: Traditional Yield Methods Bifrost’s BTCFi Boost Requires wrapping BTC (e.g., to wBTC), adding complexity and a potential point of failure. Accepts native BTC, simplifying the process and reducing steps. Often involves navigating multiple DeFi protocols, each with its own interface and learning curve. Provides a single, intuitive platform for deposits and yield tracking. Frequent transaction signing, leading to high gas fees and repetitive actions. Minimizes transaction overhead, offering a more efficient way to earn Bitcoin interest . Exposure to smart contract risks across multiple interconnected protocols.

2025-07-24 07:00:18+00:00,Ethereum Demand Surges 32x Beyond Supply: Bitwise Predicts Price Explosion,"Ethereum’s recent price rally is being fueled by a significant structural shift in demand, according to a recent investor note from Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan. Since May 15, a surge in buying activity from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporations has resulted in the acquisition of nearly 2.83 million ETH, valued at over $10 billion. This purchasing activity has outpaced new ETH issuance by a factor of 32, contributing to a supply-demand imbalance that analysts say could persist. Hougan explained that Ethereum’s price has climbed more than 65% in the past month and 160% since April. While market sentiment plays a role in crypto asset movements, the Bitwise executive attributes this surge primarily to fundamentals, particularly the gap between how much ETH is being bought and how much is being created on-chain. In his view, the current dynamic mirrors what occurred with Bitcoin after the launch of spot BTC ETFs in early 2024. ETFs and Corporations Drive ETH Accumulation The trend reversal for Ethereum became evident in mid-May, when inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs gained momentum. According to Hougan, these investment vehicles have pulled in over $5 billion since then. Meanwhile, corporate entities have begun positioning ETH as a strategic asset within their treasuries. Companies like Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), SharpLink Gaming (SBET) , Bit Digital (BTBT), and The Ether Machine (DYNX) have all announced large ETH holdings or purchasing plans, with Bitmine alone targeting 5% of total ETH supply. SharpLink Gaming, for instance, has acquired more than 280,000 ETH, while Bitmine has amassed over 300,000 ETH. Bit Digital sold its Bitcoin reserves to acquire more than 100,000 ETH, signaling a shift in institutional preferences toward Ethereum. These companies are not only making sizable acquisitions but also publicly outlining long-term ETH strategies, indicating a structural commitment to the asset. Outlook Suggests Continued Demand Momentum The upward trajectory in demand appears likely to continue. Hougan notes that although ETH’s market capitalization is about 20% of Bitcoin’s, ETH ETFs still account for less than 12% of the assets under management held in Bitcoin ETFs. Bitwise expects that gap to narrow as stablecoin growth and tokenization trends, both primarily supported by Ethereum, attract further capital inflows. Additionally, Hougan highlights the growing appeal of ETH treasury companies, whose stock valuations are currently trading at premiums to the value of their underlying ETH holdings . This market condition incentivizes further ETH accumulation by public firms, especially if the premiums remain. He projects that these entities could collectively purchase another $20 billion in ETH over the next year, which, given Ethereum’s estimated supply issuance of 800,000 ETH in that time, could represent nearly seven times more demand than new supply. Though Ethereum does not share Bitcoin’s hard cap, Hougan emphasizes that short-term price action is largely dictated by supply and demand mechanics. Given the current imbalance, he believes the upward price movement could continue. Whether or not this trend sustains over the long term, Ethereum’s near-term price action seems increasingly influenced by institutional behavior and treasury adoption strategies.

The brokerage firm says that the S&P 500 may decline in the third quarter of this year, but ultimately reach 7,200 points by mid-2026, a more than 13% increase from its current level, reports Reuters. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson cites bullish market momentum driven by strong earnings as well as expected Fed rate cuts as the main catalysts for the new stock highs. Says Wilson, “With earnings on solid footing into next year and the Fed closer to cutting rates, valuations can remain supported around current levels (~22x) as we think about the 12-month outlook.” However, Morgan Stanley warns that rising Treasury yields, particularly if the 10-year note exceeds 4.5%, may result in an underperformance of some stocks, like small-cap equities, which are more sensitive to rates. The brokerage also says it expects a rise in costs and inflation to materialize later this year as a result of President Trump’s tariffs, which could impact firms’ profit margins. Lastly, Morgan Stanley says the stock market may dip temporarily from mid-July to August as a result of seasonal trends. Still, the brokerage firm says stock market dips in the third quarter are likely buying opportunities, predicting declines and consolidations will be temporary. As of Wednesday’s close, the S&P 500 is trading at 6,358 points.

2025-07-24 07:44:06+00:00,Why XRP Price is Down Today?,"The post Why XRP Price is Down Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After a strong rally earlier this month, the XRP price is down today. In the last 24 hours, XRP has dropped by 12.8%, falling from $3.49 to around $3.04. The sudden dip has caught many traders off guard, especially since XRP was one of July’s best-performing altcoins. Why XRP Price is Dropping Today? Profit-Taking After a Strong Rally At the start of July, XRP was trading at just $2.17. Between July 2 and July 18, it surged by over 60%, peaking at $3.66 — its highest price this year. This strong run triggered a wave of buying interest, but also set the stage for short-term traders to lock in profits. Once the price touched $3.66, it struggled to hold that level. It closed the day lower at $3.41, a sign that buyers were losing strength. Over the next few days, the price stayed within a narrow range, and eventually broke lower on July 23 with a single-day drop of over 10%. The selling has continued into today, pulling the price further down to $3.04. Altcoin Season Index Is Weakening Another reason behind the XRP drop is the shift in broader altcoin market sentiment. XRP’s performance often follows the trend of other large-cap altcoins. But in the past few days, Bitcoin dominance has started to rise again, meaning investors are rotating back into BTC and away from altcoins. According to the CMC Altcoin Season Index , the altcoin market is losing steam. The index currently sits at 37 , far below the threshold of 75 that signals a strong altcoin season. XRP’s all-time high was $3.84, set back in January 2018. With the recent rally peaking at $3.66 , XRP got very close to that level — and that likely triggered psychological resistance among traders. Breaking an ATH is never easy, and in many cases, assets pull back before retesting. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is Ripple Powering BlackRock’s $100 Trillion Blockchain Vision? , XRP Price Today On the technical side, XRP is still holding above its 50-day EMA at $2.64, showing that the longer-term trend remains bullish. The RSI is currently at 55.81, indicating that XRP is not yet oversold, but no longer overbought either. This suggests the current drop may be more of a healthy correction after a strong rally, rather than the start of a prolonged downtrend. XRP price drop today appears to be driven by a mix of profit-taking, slowing altcoin momentum, and natural resistance near historical highs. While short-term traders might see increased volatility, the bigger trend for XRP still looks intact — as long as the broader market doesn’t reverse sharply. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-24 07:45:23+00:00,Bitcoin VIX Correlation: Unveiling a Crucial Shift in Crypto Market Dynamics,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin VIX Correlation: Unveiling a Crucial Shift in Crypto Market Dynamics Have you ever wondered if Bitcoin, often touted as a decentralized disruptor, is truly immune to the tremors of traditional finance? Recent data suggests a fascinating and crucial shift is underway, challenging long-held assumptions. The Bitcoin VIX correlation , a key indicator of how Bitcoin’s volatility aligns with that of the broader market, has just hit an unprecedented all-time high. This isn’t just a technical blip; it signals a profound evolution in how Bitcoin behaves and interacts with the global financial system. Understanding the Alarming Bitcoin VIX Correlation At its core, a correlation coefficient measures the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other. A value of 1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation, meaning they move in lockstep. A value of -1.0 signifies a perfect negative correlation, moving in opposite directions. A value of 0 suggests no linear relationship at all. The Record Breaker: The 90-day correlation coefficient between Bitcoin’s 30-day implied volatility (IV) indices (from platforms like Deribit and Volmex) and the S&P 500 volatility index (VIX) has recently soared to an astounding 0.88. This figure, reported by CoinDesk citing TradingView data, is not just high; it’s an all-time high. Bitcoin’s IV: Think of Bitcoin’s implied volatility as the market’s expectation of how much Bitcoin’s price will fluctuate in the future. It’s derived from options prices on exchanges like Deribit and Volmex, giving us a forward-looking view of anticipated price swings. The VIX: Often dubbed the ‘fear gauge’ of Wall Street, the VIX measures the expected volatility of the S&P 500 index over the next 30 days. When the VIX is high, it generally indicates investor anxiety and anticipation of significant market turbulence in traditional stocks. The fact that these two distinct measures of market uncertainty are now moving so closely together suggests that Bitcoin’s volatility dynamics are increasingly mirroring those of traditional equities. This convergence implies that when traditional markets experience heightened uncertainty, Bitcoin’s expected volatility tends to follow suit. But why is this happening now? Why is Institutional Adoption Fueling the Bitcoin VIX Correlation ? The primary driver behind this remarkable shift, according to Markus Thielen, founder of crypto research firm 10x Research, is the increasing participation of institutional investors in the crypto market. This isn’t just about big money entering; it’s about how that money operates. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements were largely driven by retail sentiment, often characterized by rapid, unpredictable swings. However, the landscape has changed dramatically: Sophisticated Players: We’re talking about hedge funds, asset managers, pension funds, and even sovereign wealth funds. These entities bring with them sophisticated trading strategies, risk management protocols, and a deep understanding of traditional market dynamics. Volatility Sellers: A key aspect Thielen highlights is the presence of ‘volatility sellers’ among these institutions. In traditional markets, selling volatility (e.g., selling options) is a common strategy to generate income, especially in periods of perceived stability. As institutions enter the Bitcoin market, they bring these strategies with them. When they sell Bitcoin options, they effectively bet on lower future volatility, which can suppress Bitcoin’s implied volatility and align it more closely with broader market trends. Arbitrage Opportunities: Institutions are also adept at identifying and exploiting arbitrage opportunities between different markets. As Bitcoin becomes more liquid and accessible through regulated products (like spot Bitcoin ETFs), it becomes easier for these players to bridge the gap between crypto and traditional finance, further intertwining their behaviors. This influx of institutional capital and trading expertise is essentially ‘maturing’ the Bitcoin market. It’s becoming less of a wild frontier and more of a structured, predictable asset class, albeit with its unique characteristics. This convergence in market behavior naturally leads to a stronger Bitcoin VIX correlation . What Does This Strong Bitcoin VIX Correlation Mean for Investors? The implications of this record-high correlation are profound, reshaping how investors should view and interact with Bitcoin. It challenges some long-held narratives and opens new considerations for portfolio management. Is Bitcoin Still a Safe Haven or a Diversifier? For years, one of Bitcoin’s appealing qualities was its perceived low correlation with traditional assets.

The consensus among analysts points towards a less dramatic, yet equally impactful, set of forces: short-term profit-taking and a cascade of leveraged liquidations. This recent crypto pullback , while unsettling for some, offers valuable insights into the inherent dynamics of this rapidly evolving financial landscape. What Triggered the Recent Crypto Pullback? When the market takes a sudden turn, the immediate instinct is often to search for a definitive cause – a major news event, a regulatory announcement, or a macroeconomic shift. However, according to reports from The Block, citing multiple analysts, the recent crypto pullback was not propelled by any singular, clear catalyst. Instead, it appears to be a natural consequence of market mechanics and investor behavior. Min Jung, an analyst at Presto Research, characterized the decline as a ‘natural pause’ following a period of significant gains. To put this into perspective, consider the performance of major altcoins just before the dip: Ethereum (ETH): Saw a commendable 7% rise over the preceding week. Dogecoin (DOGE): Experienced an even more impressive 12% surge within the same timeframe. Such rapid ascents often precede periods of consolidation or correction as early investors look to secure their profits. This is a classic market phenomenon: what goes up quickly often sees a temporary reversal as participants take some chips off the table. Adding another layer to this explanation, Vincent Liu, CIO of Kronos Research, pointed to two critical factors: Over-leveraged Altcoin Positions: Many traders had opened positions, particularly in altcoins, using borrowed funds (leverage). While leverage can amplify gains, it also dramatically magnifies losses. Thinning Liquidity: This refers to a market condition where there are fewer buyers and sellers, making it harder to execute large trades without significantly impacting the price. When liquidity thins, even relatively small sell orders can trigger disproportionately large price drops. Together, these factors created a fertile ground for a sharp downturn, transforming what might have been a minor correction into a more pronounced crypto pullback . Understanding the Mechanics: Profit-Taking vs. Liquidations To truly grasp the recent market movements, it’s essential to differentiate between profit-taking and liquidations, as both played crucial roles in the crypto pullback . Profit-Taking: Cashing In on Gains Profit-taking is a straightforward concept. When an asset’s price rises significantly, investors who bought at lower prices decide to sell a portion or all of their holdings to realize their gains. This is a healthy and normal part of any market cycle. After assets like Ethereum and Dogecoin experienced substantial weekly rallies, it was almost inevitable that some investors would choose to lock in those profits. This selling pressure, while organic, contributes to downward price momentum. Liquidations: The Domino Effect of Leverage Liquidations are far more impactful and often lead to sharper, more volatile drops. They occur when traders use leverage – borrowing funds to increase their exposure to an asset. While leverage can amplify returns, it also comes with a significant risk: if the market moves against a leveraged position, the trader’s collateral might fall below a certain threshold (known as the maintenance margin). At this point, exchanges automatically close (liquidate) the position to prevent further losses to the lender. Here’s how liquidations contribute to a cascading effect during a crypto pullback : Initial Price Drop: A small price decline (perhaps due to profit-taking) pushes some leveraged positions towards their liquidation price. Forced Selling: As these positions are liquidated, the exchange sells the underlying assets, adding more selling pressure to the market. Further Price Drop: This increased selling drives prices down even further, triggering more liquidations, creating a negative feedback loop. Market Instability: This cascade can lead to rapid and dramatic price crashes, even without a major fundamental shift in the asset’s value. The combination of investors deliberately selling for profit and the forced selling from liquidations creates a powerful downward force that can quickly turn a minor dip into a significant crypto pullback . The Role of Altcoins and Liquidity in the Crypto Pullback While Bitcoin often sets the tone for the broader market, altcoins frequently exhibit higher volatility and can amplify market movements. This was evident in the recent crypto pullback , where altcoin positions were particularly susceptible.

2025-07-24 08:00:15+00:00,Bitcoin Consolidates Below $120K as Exchange Activity Reflects Mixed Market Signals,"Bitcoin continues to hover below its all-time high, with current trading levels near $118,000 reflecting a 0.6% daily drop and a 3.8% pullback from the peak above $123,000 recorded earlier this month. While the broader trend remains uncertain, analysts have assessed on-chain activity for signs of the next major move. Recent data from CryptoQuant analysts highlights a divide between retail and institutional behavior across leading exchanges, raising questions about potential profit-taking or strategic accumulation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Defend This Key Support For $180,000 Year-End Target, Analyst Says Bitcoin Retail Traders Sell into Strength, While Whales Accumulate On the one hand, short-term holder (STH) behavior on Binance suggests some market participants are opting to take profits following the asset’s strong rally. On the other hand, Kraken has recorded a sharp outflow of Bitcoin, a movement typically associated with whale activity or long-term accumulation. This contrasting activity across platforms suggests a split in market sentiment, with retail traders potentially trimming their exposure and larger players preparing for sustained upside. According to CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, the Binance Exchange Inflow Ratio for Short-Term Holders recently crossed the 0.4 level, historically linked to increased retail selling pressure. These STHs, who typically hold Bitcoin for fewer than 155 days, tend to deposit funds to exchanges during periods of price strength to lock in gains. The spike above this threshold may indicate a growing tendency among retail investors to exit positions in anticipation of volatility. In contrast, the same analysis pointed to significant outflows from Kraken, with over 9,600 BTC withdrawn on July 22, one of the highest single-day outflows seen in recent months. Taha interpreted this as a potential signal of whale accumulation, with institutional or high-net-worth participants removing assets from exchange custody, often in preparation for long-term storage. This divergence in behavior between Binance and Kraken highlights the differing strategies employed by market segments, with retail users leaning toward short-term positioning and whales opting for long-term accumulation. Binance Reserve Trends Highlight Strengthening Profit Margins Adding another layer to the evolving market picture, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost shared that Binance’s unrealized profit on its Bitcoin reserves has hit an all-time high of approximately 60,000 BTC. This figure has grown despite a gradual decline in total BTC reserves held on the platform, which have fallen from 631,000 BTC in September 2024 to 574,000 BTC as of now. A portion of these holdings, around 16,000 BTC, is locked in custodial wallets to back the BTCB token on the BNB Chain, serving operational purposes. Darkfost emphasized that decreasing exchange reserves are often interpreted as a sign of investor confidence, reflecting a preference to store Bitcoin in personal wallets rather than leaving it on centralized platforms.

2025-07-24 08:06:51+00:00,Why Has Crypto Dropped Today?,"The post Why Has Crypto Dropped Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market just saw a big drop, wiping out more than $130 billion in a single day. After weeks of strong gains, this sharp pullback has left many traders asking one big question: Why is the market crashing now? Many see this drop as a mix of profit-taking, big liquidations, and weak ETF interest. Let’s break it down. Profit-Taking Kicked Things Off The crash began with many traders cashing in on recent gains. Bitcoin had jumped nearly 17% in the past month, pulling altcoins up along with it. After such a strong rally, it was natural for some investors to lock in profits. This wave of selling added pressure across the board, especially on altcoins. In just one day, the total crypto market dropped by 3.3%, but altcoins fell even harder. XRP plunged 12.4%, DOGE lost 14%, and PEPE dropped 13.5% — showing how quickly gains can vanish when traders rush to sell. ETF Inflows Are Slowing Down On top of profit-taking, institutional buying has slowed down too. The Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw three straight days of outflows, with $85.8 million leaving the market on July 23 alone. Fidelity led the charge, followed by ARK Invest and Bitwise. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are also cooling off. Inflows fell to $332 million, down sharply from $726 million the previous week. This slowdown suggests big players are waiting on the sidelines before placing new bets. Liquidations Hit Traders Hard Another big reason for the drop was the huge liquidation of leveraged positions. In the last 24 hours, over 314,000 traders were liquidated, wiping out $968 million , mostly from long trades. Bitcoin’s fall below $118,000 triggered a chain reaction of stop-losses and forced selling. Ethereum saw nearly $195 million in liquidations, while XRP faced $113 million, showing how quickly high leverage can lead to a deep market flush. SEC Pause and Fed Decision Add Worries Adding to the nerves, the SEC decided to pause Bitwise’s new crypto index ETF. Many people thought this ETF would launch soon and bring fresh money into crypto. The reason? XRP’s ongoing legal issues. SEC’s Bitwise ETF “Pause” — Orchestrated? First, they approve it. Then they slam the brakes. Who benefits from confusion while XRP’s rails are being loaded by institutions? The same elite who don’t want you front-running the reset.

During the latest price surge, ETH spot volumes broke out, as both retail and whales are trying to tap the token’s growth. As a result of increased interest in spot ETH, exchanges have seen a drawdown on their reserves, with around 8.9M ETH available on spot markets. Derivative exchanges hold around 10M ETH for collaterals. The top 10 exchanges have seen increased outflows in July, signaling additional accumulation to self-custodial wallets. ETH outflows picked up again in July, as whales started accumulating tokens. | Source: CryptoQuant . For now, ETH behaves as a scarce resource, especially on days of peak demand from whales. Spot trading also reflects selling, as some short-term traders buy ETH only to realize profits. ETH whales are also trading their reserves often, to achieve a lower average ETH price. ETH outperformed on the weekly spot trading volumes, rising above BTC activity for the first time since June 2024. ETH spot volumes reached beyond $25.7B in the past week, while BTC stopped at $24.4B. The ETH rally is still seen as shaky, as the token failed to break above $4,000. After a hike above $3,800, ETH consolidated and slid to $3,579.95, though still remaining interesting for traders and spot buyers. The recent price correction follows long liquidations, as more than 91% of positions liquidated were longs. Despite the spike in ETH spot volumes, derivatives are still leading the market trends, especially when attacking specific positions. Following a recent short squeeze, ETH traders are now sweeping the long positions, potentially leading to a brief return to a lower price range. Is ETH overheated? The recent spike of ETH above $3,800 raised the problem of an overheating market. However, ETH has not shown irrational growth and generally moves with a similar pace to other altcoins.

Here Are the Details!,"US President Donald Trump has taken the pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom he has long criticized, hinted at impeachment, and called for his resignation, a step further. Trump will make a surprise visit to the Fed today. Details of the visit are being kept under wraps, and it''s not yet known whether there will be a private meeting with Powell. According to the statement made by the White House, Trump will go to the FED building at 23:00 Turkish time. As is well known, Donald Trump has been constantly pressuring Fed Chair Powell. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates sufficiently, calling him an “idiot.” Trump had publicly hinted that he was considering firing Powell. The day before, Trump had stated that Powell should cut interest rates by 3%, saying, “He''ll be gone soon anyway.” Trump, who insulted Powell in his statements, such as calling her stupid and awful, stated that Powell was politically motivated and accused her of causing great financial losses to the country and doing a bad job. Trump, who has targeted Powell many times, has begun holding talks with potential Fed chair candidates as Powell''s term approaches. While US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed this, Bessent said in a statement to Fox News that the candidates for the next Fed chair are expected to be announced in December or January. *This is not investment advice.

US President Donald Trump has taken the pressure on Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom he has long criticized, hinted at impeachment, and called for his resignation, a step further. Trump will make a surprise visit to the Fed today. Details of the visit are being kept under wraps, and it''s not yet known whether there will be a private meeting with Powell. According to the statement made by the White House, Trump will go to the FED building at 23:00 Turkish time. As is well known, Donald Trump has been constantly pressuring Fed Chair Powell. Trump has repeatedly criticized Powell for not lowering interest rates sufficiently, calling him an “idiot.” Trump had publicly hinted that he was considering firing Powell. The day before, Trump had stated that Powell should cut interest rates by 3%, saying, “He''ll be gone soon anyway.” Trump, who insulted Powell in his statements, such as calling her stupid and awful, stated that Powell was politically motivated and accused her of causing great financial losses to the country and doing a bad job. Trump, who has targeted Powell many times, has begun holding talks with potential Fed chair candidates as Powell''s term approaches. While US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed this, Bessent said in a statement to Fox News that the candidates for the next Fed chair are expected to be announced in December or January. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-24 08:20:23+00:00,Bitcoin Rally: Unleashing the Unprecedented Power of Institutions and Whales,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Rally: Unleashing the Unprecedented Power of Institutions and Whales The cryptocurrency world is buzzing, and for good reason. A significant Bitcoin rally is currently unfolding, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. However, if you’re feeling a sense of déjà vu from previous bull runs, take a closer look. This time, the driving forces behind the market’s ascent appear to be remarkably different, signaling a new era for digital assets. What’s Truly Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Rally ? According to insights shared by crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci of CryptoQuant on X, the current Bitcoin rally is not a replay of past retail-driven frenzies. Instead, it’s primarily propelled by the strategic movements of institutional investors and large-scale holders, often referred to as ‘whales.’ This represents a significant shift in market dynamics. Consider these compelling data points: Retail Exodus: Since early 2023, everyday retail investors have consistently reduced their Bitcoin holdings. This suggests a cautious, or perhaps disengaged, stance from the smaller players who often fueled previous explosive surges. Institutional Influx: In stark contrast, institutional investors have been on an aggressive accumulation spree since the beginning of 2024. These are not your average individual traders; we’re talking about hedge funds, asset managers, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds making calculated, large-scale investments. Whale Activity: Alongside institutions, ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin – have also been actively increasing their positions. Their significant capital allows them to move the market in ways smaller investors cannot. This dichotomy paints a clear picture: while many individual investors might still be on the sidelines, the big players are confidently entering the arena, laying the groundwork for what could be a more sustainable upward trend. Is the Retail Investor Missing Out on the Current Bitcoin Rally ? The absence of widespread retail participation is one of the most intriguing aspects of this particular Bitcoin rally . Burak Kesmeci points to Google Trends data, which shows that search volumes for ‘Bitcoin’ remain comparatively low. This is a critical indicator because high search interest often precedes or accompanies significant retail FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) – a sentiment that was undeniably present during the euphoric bull run of 2021. Let’s compare the sentiment: Characteristic Current Bitcoin Rally (2024) 2021 Bull Run Primary Drivers Institutions and Whales Retail Investors (significant) Google Search Volume for “Bitcoin” Comparatively Low Very High (peak interest) Retail FOMO Sentiment Minimal to Non-existent Widespread and Intense Market Maturity Increasingly Mature Still Nascent The fact that retail investors have yet to enter the market on a large scale, despite Bitcoin’s impressive performance, leads Kesmeci to believe that there is still significant room for the market to rise. This underlying strength, built on institutional conviction rather than speculative retail exuberance, could suggest a more stable and prolonged growth phase. Understanding the Dynamics: Why This Bitcoin Rally is Different The shift in who is driving the Bitcoin rally has profound implications for the market’s future trajectory. This isn’t just about price; it’s about the fundamental maturation of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Key reasons why this rally stands apart: Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Acceptance: The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in major markets has opened doors for traditional finance players to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This regulatory endorsement provides a level of comfort and legitimacy that was absent in previous cycles, making it easier for institutions to allocate capital. Long-Term Horizon: Institutional investors typically operate with a longer investment horizon compared to many retail traders. Their accumulation often signifies a belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition as a digital store of value or a hedge against inflation, rather than short-term speculative gains. Reduced Volatility (Potentially): While Bitcoin remains volatile, a market driven by institutional capital can exhibit different patterns. Their measured accumulation and less emotional trading behavior could potentially lead to less dramatic price swings compared to periods dominated by retail FOMO and panic selling. Fundamental Growth vs. Hype: This rally appears to be more rooted in fundamental adoption and infrastructure development rather than pure speculative hype. As more institutions integrate crypto into their portfolios and services, the underlying demand strengthens. The implication is that the market might be building a more robust foundation, less susceptible to the wild swings associated with rapid retail entry and exit.

2025-07-24 08:24:12+00:00,Bitcoin and Ethereum Whales Hold on Binance While OKX Traders Rush to Exit Profits,"Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) holders on Binance are showing signs of strong holding behavior. This, however, contrasts with the profit-taking patterns seen on OKX. Behavioral Divergence Between Binance and OKX Users According to new data shared by CryptoQuant, as Bitcoin traded near $120,000 this week, OKX’s realized price on user deposit addresses has jumped to $97,180. This pointed to a rush of inflows and profit-taking as the market moved higher. During the same period, Binance’s realized price for Bitcoin deposits remained steady at $45,070. This means that users are sticking to their cost bases and resisting the urge to sell despite significant volatility. Such a trend is a major shift from previous rallies where Binance whales actively realized profits, and suggests a decline in large-holder selling pressure. Ethereum shows a similar divergence. With ETH around $3,570, OKX’s realized price has climbed to $3,100, while Binance’s sits at $2,920, increasing gradually rather than in sharp moves. This pattern indicates that Binance users are opting for longer-term positioning instead of reacting to every price swing. On the other hand, OKX user behavior aligns with short-term speculative trading as realized prices rise quickly with market gains. The reduction in profit-taking by Binance whales may point to growing confidence in further upside potential or a simple lack of urgency to exit. What’s Next For Bitcoin and Altcoins This broader holding trend among Binance users may reflect the constructive market structure Swissblock described. In its latest analysis, the analytics firm explained that Bitcoin’s price structure remains bullish despite momentum pausing. Currently, while momentum has stalled, there is no breakdown in structure. This means that Bitcoin is holding its $117.4K support and projecting above $118K even after absorbing selling pressure. As such, buyers remain active, and the uptrend is intact. After recent rallies, altcoins are also in a cooling phase with corrections and drawdowns, which also sets up future opportunities. Swissblock said that most altcoins remain in the “de-risk” quadrant and reflect a cautious market without strong buy signals yet. While a few alts show early signs of recovery, it is not the time for aggressive re-entry. The recommended approach is to wait for a clear transition into the “accumulation quadrant,” where structure and momentum align.

2025-07-24 08:40:29+00:00,"Bitcoin RSI: Unleashing a Prolonged Bull Run, PlanB Predicts Months of Overbought Conditions","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin RSI: Unleashing a Prolonged Bull Run, PlanB Predicts Months of Overbought Conditions Are you feeling the palpable buzz in the crypto market? Bitcoin has been on an incredible trajectory, captivating investors and analysts alike. But what’s truly driving this momentum, and how long can it last? According to renowned analyst PlanB, the creator of the widely followed Stock-to-Flow model, Bitcoin’s current market behavior, particularly its Relative Strength Index (RSI), suggests we might just be at the beginning of an extended period of strong performance. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; PlanB’s analysis of the Bitcoin RSI points to a sustained overbought condition, mirroring the most explosive phases of past bull cycles. Let’s dive into what this means for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Exactly is the Bitcoin RSI and Why Does it Matter? Before we delve deeper into PlanB’s intriguing prediction, it’s crucial to understand the tool he’s referencing: the Relative Strength Index (RSI). For those new to technical analysis, the RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It oscillates between zero and 100, providing insights into whether an asset is overbought or oversold. Here’s a quick breakdown: RSI above 70: Typically indicates an overbought condition, suggesting the asset may be overvalued and due for a price correction. RSI below 30: Generally signals an oversold condition, implying the asset may be undervalued and due for a price rebound. RSI between 30 and 70: Suggests the asset is trading within a neutral range, without strong overbought or oversold signals. In the context of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin RSI is a powerful indicator that many traders and investors closely monitor. It helps gauge market sentiment and potential turning points. However, as PlanB’s analysis suggests, sometimes ‘overbought’ isn’t a signal to sell, but rather a characteristic of a strong, enduring bull market. PlanB’s Bold Prediction: A Prolonged Overbought Bitcoin RSI? PlanB recently shared his fascinating observation on X (formerly Twitter), stating that Bitcoin’s (BTC) Relative Strength Index (RSI) is currently hovering around 75. What makes this significant is his prediction that the Bitcoin RSI is expected to remain above 80 for several months. This isn’t a random guess; it’s a pattern he identifies by looking back at previous bull cycles. According to PlanB, this sustained high RSI is not an anomaly but a recurring feature of Bitcoin’s most explosive growth phases. He explicitly cited the historical precedents of 2011, 2013, 2017, and 2021. In these years, Bitcoin experienced periods where its RSI stayed in the ‘overbought’ territory for extended durations, defying the conventional wisdom that an overbought asset must immediately correct. Instead, it signaled immense buying pressure and a strong upward trend. This perspective offers a refreshing take for many investors who might feel anxious about an ‘overbought’ signal. PlanB, known for his data-driven approach, implies that for Bitcoin, a high RSI during a bull market can simply mean the market is exceptionally strong, not necessarily on the brink of collapse. It’s a testament to the unique market dynamics of Bitcoin during its parabolic runs. Is a Sustained Overbought Bitcoin RSI Truly Unprecedented? While a high RSI might typically trigger caution, PlanB’s assertion that the Bitcoin RSI can remain overbought for months is backed by historical data. Let’s look at some examples from previous cycles: Bull Cycle Year(s) Peak RSI (Approx.) Duration Above 70 (Approx.) Market Behavior 2011 ~95 ~3 months Initial parabolic surge, then significant correction. 2013 ~95 ~4-5 months (two distinct peaks) Massive price appreciation, followed by a bear market. 2017 ~95 ~6 months Extended bull run, reaching all-time highs, before a major correction. 2021 ~90 ~5-6 months (split into two legs) Double-peak bull run, establishing new all-time highs. As the table illustrates, sustained periods of high RSI are indeed a hallmark of Bitcoin’s most aggressive bull markets. This doesn’t mean corrections don’t happen; they do, but often after an extended period of high RSI, or they are shallower and shorter-lived than what might be expected in traditional markets. The challenge lies in discerning whether the current cycle will perfectly mirror these past patterns or present its own unique twists. While history often rhymes, it rarely repeats exactly. Factors like institutional adoption, global macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, adding layers of complexity to the current market.

Market Behavior 2011 ~95 ~3 months Initial parabolic surge, then significant correction. 2013 ~95 ~4-5 months (two distinct peaks) Massive price appreciation, followed by a bear market. 2017 ~95 ~6 months Extended bull run, reaching all-time highs, before a major correction. 2021 ~90 ~5-6 months (split into two legs) Double-peak bull run, establishing new all-time highs. As the table illustrates, sustained periods of high RSI are indeed a hallmark of Bitcoin’s most aggressive bull markets. This doesn’t mean corrections don’t happen; they do, but often after an extended period of high RSI, or they are shallower and shorter-lived than what might be expected in traditional markets. The challenge lies in discerning whether the current cycle will perfectly mirror these past patterns or present its own unique twists. While history often rhymes, it rarely repeats exactly. Factors like institutional adoption, global macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving, adding layers of complexity to the current market. Actionable Insights: Navigating an Overbought Bitcoin RSI Market So, if the Bitcoin RSI is indeed set to remain in overbought territory for an extended period, what does this mean for you as an investor? Understanding this dynamic can help you make more informed decisions, but remember, this is not financial advice, an"

2025-07-24 09:00:35+00:00,"Binance Pulls Ahead In Altcoin Boom, Takes Lion’s Share Of Volume","On-chain data shows the altcoin volume saw an explosion following Bitcoin’s recent high and Binance accounted for the largest part of it. Binance Altcoin Spot Trading Volume Saw A Significant Jump Recently In a dashboard release , on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant has talked about how spot trading volume in the cryptocurrency sector changed following BTC’s all-time high (ATH) . Spot trading volume here naturally refers to the total amount of a given asset or group of assets that’s becoming involved in trading activities on the centralized spot exchanges. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in the metric for Bitcoin: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin spot trading volume observed a huge increase as the asset’s price set its ATH, indicating that traders ramped up their activity. Volume grew proportionally between Binance and the rest of the exchanges during this uptick in activity, but a shift followed in the days after the ATH: volume dropped on the other exchanges while it held up relatively well on Binance. This meant that the dominance of the platform rose. “Binance’s share of spot trading volume grew from 39% the previous day to the all-time high, to 48% the next day of the all-time high,” notes CryptoQuant. The platform’s dominance has remained strong since, though overall volume has declined on both it and the rest of the platforms. While BTC spot trading volume may have cooled off, the other side of the cryptocurrency sector, made up of the altcoins, has thrived. As is visible in the chart, the altcoin spot trading volume also jumped across Binance and the rest of the platforms when BTC set its ATH, but unlike the number one digital asset, the alts didn’t follow up with a notable decline in activity. This trend has accompanied a divergence between the prices of BTC and the others. Assets like Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have shot up, while Bitcoin has moved sideways. Just like in the case of BTC, Binance witnessed its altcoin spot trading volume grow in the days after the price ATH. “Binance dominated Altcoin spot trading volumes the days after BTC reached its all-time high, with the exchange’s share standing as high as 49% on July 18,” says the analytics firm.

2025-07-24 09:10:23+00:00,De-dollarization: BlackRock Unveils Profound Shift Towards Gold and Bitcoin,"BitcoinWorld De-dollarization: BlackRock Unveils Profound Shift Towards Gold and Bitcoin De-dollarization , a concept once relegated to niche economic discussions, is now taking center stage in global finance. The world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock, has brought this fascinating trend into sharp focus, suggesting that a significant shift is underway. Imagine a world where central banks, traditionally anchored to the U.S. dollar, are actively seeking alternatives. This isn’t just a theoretical exercise; it’s a tangible movement, driven by evolving geopolitical landscapes and economic imperatives. BlackRock’s insights, shared via @solidintel_x on X, highlight that this drive towards de-dollarization is compelling central banks to diversify their reserves, not only into established safe havens like gold but also, remarkably, to begin considering nascent digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC). This revelation sparks crucial questions about the future of global monetary systems and the emerging role of digital currencies in the portfolios of even the most conservative financial institutions. What Exactly is De-dollarization and Why is it Happening? The term de-dollarization refers to the process of reducing the reliance on the United States dollar as the dominant currency for international trade, finance, and reserve holdings. For decades, the dollar has held an unparalleled position as the world’s primary reserve currency, the medium for most international transactions, and the benchmark for commodity prices. This dominance has afforded the U.S. significant economic and geopolitical advantages, often termed the “exorbitant privilege.” However, several factors are now contributing to a gradual, yet persistent, push towards de-dollarization: Geopolitical Shifts: Recent geopolitical tensions and the weaponization of financial sanctions have prompted many nations to seek greater financial autonomy. Countries are wary of their foreign exchange reserves being frozen or their access to the global financial system being restricted, leading them to explore alternatives to dollar-denominated assets. Economic Diversification: The rise of new economic powers, particularly in Asia, has led to a natural desire for these nations to conduct trade in their own currencies or other non-dollar alternatives. This reflects a broader trend of a multipolar world economy. Inflation and Debt Concerns: Concerns over the U.S. national debt and inflationary pressures within the U.S. economy can also erode confidence in the dollar’s long-term stability, prompting central banks to look for more diverse and resilient reserve assets. Technological Advancements: The advent of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and blockchain technology offers new avenues for cross-border payments and reserve management that bypass traditional dollar-centric systems. This multifaceted pressure indicates that de-dollarization is not merely a fleeting trend but a fundamental recalibration of global financial power dynamics. Why Are Central Banks Actively Diversifying Their Reserves? Central banks are the custodians of a nation’s financial stability, managing its currency, controlling inflation, and crucially, maintaining foreign exchange reserves. These reserves are vital for various purposes, including: Purpose of Reserves Explanation Currency Stability To intervene in foreign exchange markets to support or stabilize the domestic currency. Debt Repayment To meet international obligations, such as repaying foreign debts. Import Financing To pay for essential imports, especially during times of economic stress. Crisis Buffer To act as a buffer against economic shocks or financial crises. Given these critical functions, the composition of reserves is a strategic decision. The move towards diversification is a proactive measure by central banks to enhance the resilience and security of their national wealth. Relying too heavily on a single currency, even one as dominant as the U.S. dollar, introduces concentrated risk. By spreading their holdings across multiple currencies and asset classes, central banks aim to mitigate risks associated with currency fluctuations, inflation in specific economies, and geopolitical vulnerabilities. This strategic shift is a direct response to the increasing momentum of de-dollarization , as nations seek to safeguard their economic sovereignty and ensure long-term stability in an unpredictable global environment. Gold: The Enduring Safe Haven in a De-dollarizing World For millennia, gold has served as the ultimate store of value, a tangible asset that transcends national currencies and political boundaries. In the context of de-dollarization , its appeal is more pronounced than ever. Central banks globally have been accumulating gold at a significant pace, reaching record levels of purchases in recent years. This isn’t merely a nostalgic return to an old standard; it’s a calculated strategic move for several compelling reasons:",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/de-dollarization-gold-bitcoin-shift/,FIAT|BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,Crypto News|BITCOIN|BlackRock|Central banks|De-Dollarization|Gold,BTC,"De-dollarization: BlackRock Unveils Profound Shift Towards Gold and Bitcoin.

In a new blog post, Hayes predicts that in less than six months Bitcoin ( BTC ) will soar by more than 111% its current value, while Ethereum ( ETH ) will increase by more than 179% its current value. “My year-end targets: Bitcoin = $250,000. Ether = $10,000.” Hayes also says that Ethereum is primed for an explosive breakout, in part, due to growing adoption by traditional finance, adding that the current holdings of his family office, Maelstrom Fund, are heavily invested in the top altcoin by market cap. “It’s pretty simple: Maelstrom is fully invested. Because we are degens (degenerates), the shitcoin space offers amazing opportunities to outperform Bitcoin, the crypto reserve asset.

2025-07-24 09:20:44+00:00,Ripple warns of rising XRP scams on YouTube,"Ripple has raised the alarm over a fresh wave of XRP scams spreading rapidly on YouTube. In a recent post, the blockchain firm revealed that scammers have been hijacking existing YouTube accounts, altering them to appear as Ripple’s official handle. This is how scammers are pushing out fake giveaway schemes designed to dupe unsuspecting users. Such frauds tend to pick up when the market is running high with bullish sentiments. The digital assets market recorded massive rallies throughout July as Bitcoin (BTC) went on to print an all-time high above $123K. Meanwhile, the current pullback led the XRP price to drop by 12% over the last 24 hours. Ripple CEO issues scam alert Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, echoed the warning, saying, “Like clockwork, with success and market rallies, scammers ramp up their attacks, PLEASE BEWARE.” He urged users to stay alert and reiterated that neither he nor the company will ever ask for XRP to be sent for any reason. “We’ll keep reporting these. Please do the same,” he added. In the end, he suggested that “As always, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” The surge in scams arrives just as the XRP price posted a surge of more than 42% in the last 30 days. XRP went to breach the $3.6 mark last week, hinting at printing a new ATH before the rally dissolved. XRP is trading at an average price of $3.09 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume skyrocketed by 136% to stand at $16.66 billion. Source: Brad Garlinghouse’s X . Ripple is still dealing with the high-profile legal battle with the SEC. A proposed $50M settlement is on the table, with a filing deadline set for August 15. These developments have reignited public interest in XRP, giving scammers an opening to exploit FOMO and misinformation. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” sentiment in the market. However, the cumulative crypto market cap dropped by 2% over the last day to stand at $3.86 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 16% to hit $223 billion. Ripple reports AI-powered giveaway frauds Ripple has flagged a surge in fraudulent posts across YouTube, X, Facebook, and Discord. In a report, it has specifically called out scams that span from fake Elon Musk and then Joe Biden giveaway videos to deepfakes of Garlinghouse himself promising free XRP. Some use AI-generated voiceovers and deepfake video overlays. Others replicate real interviews and tack on scam wallet addresses. In some cases, scammers use Discord groups or fake job offers to funnel users toward malicious links or phishing sites. Ripple’s CTO recently flagged a fake 100 million XRP airdrop scam that had gained traction online. He warned that scammers were leveraging post-court-win hype, deepfake videos, and misleading visual overlays to con users. Many of these scams rely on fake urgency, urging viewers to “claim” XRP by sending funds to wallets controlled by fraudsters. According to TRM Labs, more than $9 billion was lost to crypto fraud schemes in 2022 alone. Imposter scams accounted for $2.3 billion in reported losses the same year. Between 2021 and 2023, social media–driven scams racked up an estimated $2.7 billion in consumer losses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Ripple CEO issues scam alert Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s CEO, echoed the warning, saying, “Like clockwork, with success and market rallies, scammers ramp up their attacks, PLEASE BEWARE.” He urged users to stay alert and reiterated that neither he nor the company will ever ask for XRP to be sent for any reason. “We’ll keep reporting these. Please do the same,” he added. In the end, he suggested that “As always, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.” The surge in scams arrives just as the XRP price posted a surge of more than 42% in the last 30 days. XRP went to breach the $3.6 mark last week, hinting at printing a new ATH before the rally dissolved. XRP is trading at an average price of $3.09 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume skyrocketed by 136% to stand at $16.66 billion. Source: Brad Garlinghouse’s X . Ripple is still dealing with the high-profile legal battle with the SEC. A proposed $50M settlement is on the table, with a filing deadline set for August 15. These developments have reignited public interest in XRP, giving scammers an opening to exploit FOMO and misinformation. The fear and greed index is still flashing “Greed” sentiment in the market. However, the cumulative crypto market cap dropped by 2% over the last day to stand at $3.86 trillion. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 16% to hit $223 billion. Ripple reports AI-powered giveaway frauds Ripple has flagged a surge in fraudulent posts across YouTube, X, Facebook, and Discord. In a report, it has specifically called out scams that span from fake Elon Musk and then Joe Biden giveaway videos to deepfakes of Garlinghouse himself promising free XRP. Some use AI-generated voiceovers and deepfake video overlays. Others replicate real interviews and tack on scam wallet addresses. In some cases, scammers use Discord groups or fake job offers to funnel users toward malicious links or phishing sites. Ripple’s CTO recently flagged a fake 100 million XRP airdrop scam that had gained traction online. He warned that scammers were leveraging post-court-win hype, deepfake videos, and misleading visual overlays to con users. Many of these scams rely on fake urgency, urging viewers to “claim” XRP by sending funds to wallets controlled by fraudsters. According to TRM Labs, more than $9 billion was lost to crypto fraud schemes in 2022 alone. Imposter scams accounted for $2.3 billion in reported losses the same year. Between 2021 and 2023, social media–driven scams racked up an estimated $2.7 billion in consumer losses. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

We know you’re curious. Let’s dive in. A Different Way to Look at Retirement The charts cover 96 countries and ages 5 to 75, with retirement years ranging from 2025 to 2055. Instead of using fiat currency, the model assumes you’ll retire using only Bitcoin, and spend it steadily until age 100. It also factors in 7% annual fiat inflation and uses a power-law support line to estimate Bitcoin’s long-term value.

For those planning to retire this year , the study suggests most people in developed countries will need between 1 and 10 BTC.

2025-07-24 09:30:18+00:00,"Japan Bitcoin Acquisition: Quantum Solutions’ Audacious Plan to Secure 3,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Japan Bitcoin Acquisition: Quantum Solutions’ Audacious Plan to Secure 3,000 BTC Japan Bitcoin acquisition is making headlines, and the latest news from Quantum Solutions is set to send ripples across the cryptocurrency world. Imagine a traditional, publicly listed company in Japan, known for its diverse business ventures, now setting its sights on accumulating a substantial amount of Bitcoin. This isn’t just a speculative gamble; it’s a strategic move that underscores a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. Quantum Solutions’ audacious plan to acquire up to 3,000 BTC within the next 12 months isn’t just a headline; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving role of digital assets in corporate treasury strategies. Why Are Companies Eyeing a Japan Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? The decision by companies like Quantum Solutions to embrace Bitcoin as a treasury asset isn’t made lightly. It stems from a confluence of macroeconomic factors and a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s unique properties. In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, traditional cash holdings are steadily losing their purchasing power. This erosion of value prompts corporations to seek alternative stores of value, and Bitcoin has emerged as a compelling candidate. Here are some key drivers behind this shift: Inflation Hedge: With its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often touted as a digital equivalent to gold, offering a hedge against inflation. Companies are looking to protect their balance sheets from the depreciating value of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets beyond traditional investments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns in the long run. Technological Adoption: For technology-focused companies like Quantum Solutions, integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategy aligns with their innovative ethos and signals a readiness to adapt to the future of finance. It positions them as pioneers in a rapidly evolving digital economy. Strategic Advantage: Early adoption can provide a competitive edge. Companies that hold Bitcoin might attract investors interested in digital assets and potentially benefit from future price appreciation, strengthening their financial position. Demand for Digital Gold: As institutional interest grows, Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold” gains traction, making it an attractive asset for long-term holding. This strategic pivot reflects a broader recognition of Bitcoin’s maturity and its increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, moving beyond its early reputation as a niche speculative instrument. Is Japan Becoming a Hub for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? Japan has always held a unique position in the cryptocurrency landscape. It was one of the first major economies to regulate cryptocurrencies, establishing a framework that has since evolved. This regulatory clarity, combined with a strong technological base, has fostered an environment where digital assets can thrive. The recent moves by Japanese listed companies suggest a burgeoning trend, positioning Japan as a significant player in corporate Bitcoin adoption. Quantum Solutions is not an isolated case. Two other prominent Japanese listed corporations have already paved the way: Metaplanet: This financial technology company has made headlines with its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy, openly embracing Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. They view Bitcoin as a superior alternative to traditional fiat currency for long-term value preservation. Remixpoint: Another listed entity, Remixpoint, which operates a cryptocurrency exchange among other businesses, has also integrated Bitcoin into its balance sheet. Their existing involvement in the crypto space makes this a natural extension of their operations. These examples illustrate a growing confidence among Japanese public companies in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and its potential to strengthen corporate balance sheets. The cumulative effect of these Japan Bitcoin acquisition announcements could inspire more domestic firms to follow suit, creating a domino effect within the Japanese corporate sector. Quantum Solutions’ Bold Dive: What Does Their Japan Bitcoin Acquisition Plan Entail? Quantum Solutions’ announcement signals a definitive shift in their financial strategy. Their goal to hold up to 3,000 BTC within the next 12 months is ambitious and speaks volumes about their conviction in Bitcoin’s future. According to reports from CoinDesk JAPAN, the initial phase of this acquisition will involve purchasing approximately $10 million worth of BTC. Let’s break down the implications of this move: Significant Investment: A $10 million initial purchase is a substantial commitment for any company, especially one venturing into a relatively new asset class for its treasury.

A broad market correction is currently underway, against the backdrop of $737 million worth of liquidations and signs of fading retail enthusiasm. Data from CoinGlass shows that at the start of Thursday’s Asian market session, more than 243,000 traders were liquidated, totaling over $737 million in value. 85.3% of the liquidations were long positions, forcing the overly bullish positions among retail traders out of the market. 24-hour crypto liquidations. Source: CoinGlass. Ethereum traders were the biggest liquidation losers heading into Thursday, having lost $198 million to the derivatives market. The asset was followed by XRP, BTC, and SOL, which counted $115, $84, and $58 million in liquidations, respectively. Julio Moreno, head of research at CryptoQuant, believes altcoins Ethereum, XRP, and Solana may now enter a short-term correction phase. Bitcoin enters consolidation phase after failing to break $124K barrier Bitcoin (BTC) briefly surged past $123,000 on July 14 to record a new all-time high. However, since the start of the business week, the asset began consolidating in the $116,000–$120,000 range, where it has been stuck for several days. Santiment’s on-chain social data suggests that retail sentiment has cooled significantly. During the June 22 Iran-U.S. airstrike news cycle, fear and uncertainty created what analysts dubbed an “optimal time to buy,” with social volume spiking around lower BTC price mentions. But following the new high on July 14, elevated mentions of $130K–$160K price levels indicate exuberance, often seen at market tops. Retail Bullish Sentiment chart. Source: Santiment Feed. By July 19, crowd sentiment had already begun to doubt further upside following the breach of May’s high. Still, if BTC closes above $120,000 on a daily basis, a renewed push toward the all-time high at $123,218 could follow. Ethereum lead rally but dropped push to ATH After hitting highs around $3,525 and testing the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level, Ethereum (ETH) was only slightly higher on Thursday. The broader uptrend, which began after bottoming out at $1,385 in April, has now paused. Tristan Teo, founder of Elfa AI, noted a rise in ask skew, suggesting a possible local reversal. Ryan McMillin of Merkle Tree Capital added that Ethereum’s pause is understandable after its extended run, though he cautioned that over 500,000 ETH remain queued for unstaking , which could unsettle ETF-related flows. XRP Upbit whale dump stifles price momentum Ripple’s XRP has experienced a 15% drop in the past 24 hours, sliding to $3.05 after a significant sell-off on South Korean exchange Upbit. According to analyst Dom, over 75 million XRP were offloaded in a single move, negatively impacting the token’s price due to shallow order books. Just days earlier, XRP had surged 92% from $1.95 to a seven-day high of $3.66. Technical indicators pointed to bullish continuation, with a 4-hour bull pennant targeting $4.20 and the weekly MACD flipping green for the first time since XRP’s 2024 bull run. A move above the 5.5% dominance threshold for XRP, which has acted as a cap for over 2,000 days, could unlock further upside. But for now, price action has turned defensive, and bulls will have to hold on to the $3.00 and $3.10 zone to avoid more losses. Solana tests $180 support after 7% 24h drop Solana (SOL) has fallen 7% over the last 24 hours, with its price hovering around $185 after peaking at $205 on Wednesday, according to CoinGecko. The altcoin recently broke above a medium-term falling trend and confirmed an inverse head and shoulders formation by breaching resistance at $156 and running straight to levels above $200. Analyst Trader Tardigrade noted a cup-and-handle pattern on Solana’s chart stretching back to 2021, in a recent post on X. The neckline of this long-term formation sits around $250.

Instead, it’s mostly due to what’s called a long squeeze, a market event where bullish traders are forced to exit their positions, often causing sharp price drops. What is a Long Squeeze and Why is It Happening Now? A long squeeze happens when traders who expected prices to go up had used leverage to open bullish positions but then exit those positions as prices start falling. This causes further price drops, not because people are turning bearish, but because leveraged bets are being unwound. This is exactly what played out on Thursday. Bitcoin slipped nearly 1% after failing to stay above $120,000. Ethereum dropped 3%, Solana fell 8%, and XRP led the losses with a 13% decline. The overall crypto market fell 6.8% in the last 24 hours. But this pullback wasn’t fueled by traders turning bearish. Instead, over $700 million in long positions were liquidated within 24 hours, especially in ETH and XRP. A sudden 1.57% spike in Bitcoin dominance after a 9-day slump surprised the market and triggered liquidations across altcoins. 1/ Over $700M in leveraged longs were liquidated in 24h ETH and XRP were the main culprits The real reason though is $BTC.D closing up +1.57% after a 9-day downtrend This spike shocked the market, triggering liquidations across alts BTC held up well and this looks like a… pic.twitter.com/l9uSZ3e58M — Aaron Dishner (@MooninPapa) July 24, 2025 Open Interest Drops Confirm Longs Are Being Closed Key futures data support this view. Open interest, which shows the number of active contracts, has dropped across the board. XRP’s futures open interest fell more than 6% over the past two days. Solana dropped 5%, Ethereum 2%, and Bitcoin 1.5%, according to data from Velo. If new short (bearish) positions were causing the drop, open interest would have risen, not fallen. At the same time, funding rates remain positive, suggesting the majority of remaining traders continue to expect upward moves. If bearish sentiment were taking over, funding would flip negative, so this drop in open interest is a sign of longs closing out positions, not fresh shorts entering. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Planning to Retire With Bitcoin?

Some analysts suggest that holding its current price range would set the stage for reclaiming the next key area. Related Reading: PENGU Leads Top Memecoin List Amid 20% Daily Surge – What’s Behind The Rally? Dogecoin Retests Breakout Levels On Wednesday, Dogecoin momentum saw a momentary pause as Bitcoin and most of the market’s rally slowed down. The leading memecoin has recorded a massive run over the past week, increasing over 25% in the last seven days. At the start of the month, DOGE recovered from the June pullback and climbed to the $0.20 level for the first time since May. After reclaiming this crucial level mid-July, the cryptocurrency consolidated around this area, building a base before resuming its bullish run last Wednesday. Over the weekend, Dogecoin broke out of the $0.23-$0.24 resistance, soaring past the May highs to hit the $0.28 area on Monday. The token near this level on Tuesday, hovering between the $0.26-$0.27 price range. However, today’s pullback saw the memecoin drop approximately 9% in the daily timeframe and retest its breakout level around the $0.23 mark. Despite the correction, crypto analyst Kaleo affirmed that “If you’re not stacking Dogecoin on the retest of this breakout, you’re wrong.” The analyst highlighted that the token is repeating its Q4 2024 performance, when it retested its breakout level as support before starting the explosive rise to its multi-year high of $0.48. Amid the retracement, Ali Martinez also asserted that DOGE is retesting the neckline of its double bottom pattern, situated around the $0.25 mark. To the analyst, “This is a key support zone that could offer a solid entry point before the next leg up.” Notably, he previously suggested that as long as the token holds this area as support, a rally toward the $0.33-$0.40 is likely, adding that the next major resistance barrier is at $0.36. DOGE Weekly And Monthly To Determine Next Move Rekt Capital noted that Dogecoin has successfully retested its multi-year technical uptrend as support, which enabled its rally to the upside. He explained that price is currently “pressing beyond its pre-halving highs,” around the $0.22 level. A monthly close above this area would position Dogecoin price for a post-breakout retest of this level as support in August. The analyst highlighted that DOGE’s Pre-Bitcoin halving levels are confluent with the neckline of the double bottom pattern recorded in the Weekly chart. Rekt Capital explained that “any dips on the Weekly timeframe into the ~$0.22 region would figure a post-breakout retest attempt of the Double Bottom to fully confirm a breakout, whereas on the Monthly any dips would figure as a key technical milestone to finally turn Pre-Halving highs into new support.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price On The Verge: Banks And State Buy To Push ETH Above $5,500? Nonetheless, Dogecoin’s re-challenge of the $0.27 resistance depends on the success of the ongoing retests, as it would signal that this area is weakening as a rejection point and making a reclaim more likely during the next attempt. As of this writing, Dogecoin is trading at $0.24, a 54% increase in the monthly timeframe.

2025-07-24 10:10:24+00:00,Finder Earn: A Landmark Victory for Crypto Innovation in Australia,"BitcoinWorld Finder Earn: A Landmark Victory for Crypto Innovation in Australia The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, often outstripping the pace of traditional regulation. In Australia, a recent court decision has sent ripples through the fintech sector, providing much-needed clarity on the legal status of certain crypto-related products. Specifically, the Australian Federal Court has delivered a landmark ruling regarding Finder Earn , a yield-generating product offered by the popular fintech company Finder.com. This decision, which found that Finder Earn is not a financial product under Australian law, marks a significant moment for crypto innovation and regulatory frameworks down under. What Exactly is Finder Earn , and Why Was It Under Scrutiny? To understand the significance of this ruling, it is crucial to first grasp what Finder Earn is and why it attracted the attention of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Finder Earn was a product that allowed Finder.com customers to deposit Australian dollars (AUD) with the promise of a fixed, attractive yield. Finder would then use these AUD deposits to invest in a portfolio of digital assets, primarily stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, through third-party platforms. The returns generated from these investments were then passed back to the customers. ASIC, Australia’s corporate regulator, viewed Finder Earn with concern. Their primary argument was that the product constituted an ‘unlicensed financial product,’ specifically a ‘managed investment scheme’ or a ‘deposit facility’ that should be regulated under the Corporations Act 2001. ASIC’s mandate is to protect consumers and ensure market integrity, and they believed that products like Finder Earn , offering returns on pooled funds, carried risks that required the oversight and protections afforded by financial product licensing. The regulator’s contention was that customers were essentially pooling their money, with Finder managing the investments on their behalf, and expecting a return from those efforts. This structure, in ASIC’s view, resembled traditional financial products that are subject to stringent regulations designed to safeguard investors. The legal battle centered on whether the specific mechanics and characteristics of Finder Earn fit the existing definitions of regulated financial products. The Federal Court’s Unanimous Verdict: What Does It Mean for Finder Earn ? After a thorough examination, the Australian Federal Court ruled decisively in favor of Finder.com, upholding the initial decision that Finder Earn is not a financial product. This ruling means that the product, as structured, does not fall under the purview of Australia’s Corporations Act as a ‘managed investment scheme’ or a ‘financial product’ requiring specific licensing and disclosure obligations. The court’s reasoning hinged on a critical distinction: while Finder Earn did involve a ‘deposit facility,’ it did not meet the criteria of a ‘managed investment scheme’ because customers were not pooling their money to produce a return from the ‘collective efforts’ of the scheme’s operator. Instead, the court viewed it more akin to a simple debt or loan arrangement where Finder owed the customers their principal plus a fixed interest rate, regardless of the underlying performance of Finder’s digital asset investments. The risk was primarily counterparty risk with Finder, rather than investment risk in a pooled fund managed by Finder. Here’s a simplified breakdown of the court’s key findings: Not a Managed Investment Scheme: The court determined that the returns on Finder Earn were fixed and independent of the performance of the underlying crypto assets managed by Finder. Customers were not investing in a scheme where their returns depended on the collective efforts of Finder in managing a portfolio. A Deposit Facility, But Not a Financial Product: While the product was acknowledged as a ‘deposit facility’ where customers deposited money, it did not automatically qualify as a ‘financial product’ requiring specific licensing under the Corporations Act in the context ASIC argued. Focus on Contractual Obligation: The relationship was primarily a contractual one where Finder owed a fixed return, similar to a loan, rather than an investment where the customer bore the direct risk of the underlying asset performance. This nuanced interpretation highlights the challenges regulators face in applying existing laws to novel crypto products that often blur the lines between traditional financial instruments and new digital asset functionalities. Why is This Finder Earn Ruling a Game-Changer for Australian Crypto?

2025-07-24 10:11:07+00:00,Onchain Analysis Platform CryptoQuant Reveals the Source of Bitcoin''s Recent Rise! Here Are the Details,"According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin bull cycle is largely driven by institutional investors and individuals with high portfolio values. CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Rise Driven by Institutions, Retail Investors Not Yet Involved Analysts state that individual investors have tended to sell since the beginning of 2023, while institutions have entered a period of serious accumulation since the beginning of 2024. According to Google Trends data, search volumes for “Bitcoin” are still low, and the FOMO (fear of missing out) behavior driven by retail investors seen during the 2021 bull market is absent. This suggests that retail investors have not yet entered the market on a large scale.

Here Are the Details. According to on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, the current Bitcoin bull cycle is largely driven by institutional investors and individuals with high portfolio values. CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Rise Driven by Institutions, Retail Investors Not Yet Involved Analysts state that individual investors have tended to sell since the beginning of 2023, while institutions have entered a period of serious accumulation since the beginning of 2024. According to Google Trends data, search volumes for “Bitcoin” are still low, and the FOMO (fear of missing out) behavior driven by retail investors seen during the 2021 bull market is absent. This suggests that retail investors have not yet entered the market on a large scale.

2025-07-24 10:25:18+00:00,Bitcoin Investment: Satsuma Technology’s Bold £100M Move Unlocks New Frontiers,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment: Satsuma Technology’s Bold £100M Move Unlocks New Frontiers In a significant development that underscores the growing convergence of cutting-edge technology and digital assets, UK-listed AI infrastructure company Satsuma Technology has announced the successful closure of its secured convertible loan note offering, raising just over £100 million (approximately $135.5 million). This substantial funding is earmarked for two key areas: bolstering their Bitcoin investment strategy and covering essential operating expenses. This move marks a pivotal moment for Satsuma Technology, especially following its recent rebranding from Tao Alpha and its declared intent to strengthen its Bitcoin treasury. What does this mean for the company, and why is a substantial Bitcoin investment a core part of their future? What Exactly is a Convertible Loan, and Why is it Key to Satsuma’s Bitcoin Investment? To truly appreciate the significance of Satsuma Technology’s announcement, it’s helpful to understand the financial instrument at its core: the secured convertible loan note. Unlike traditional loans, a convertible loan offers a unique blend of debt and equity, providing flexibility for both the issuer and the investor. A Hybrid Instrument: At its essence, a convertible loan starts as a debt instrument, meaning Satsuma Technology has borrowed money that accrues interest. However, it comes with a crucial caveat: the lender has the option to convert the debt into equity (shares in the company) at a predetermined price or a discount to a future valuation event. Benefits for Satsuma: For a company like Satsuma, especially one focused on high-growth sectors like AI and pursuing a significant Bitcoin investment strategy, this structure offers several advantages: Immediate Capital Injection: It provides immediate access to substantial capital without the immediate dilution of existing shareholders, which would occur with a direct equity raise. Deferred Valuation: It allows the company to defer a formal valuation until a later stage, potentially when its growth and market position are stronger, leading to a higher valuation for equity conversion. Lower Initial Interest Rates: Convertible loans often carry lower interest rates than traditional debt, as investors are compensated by the potential upside of converting to equity. Benefits for Investors: Investors in Satsuma’s convertible loan gain the security of a debt instrument (it’s ‘secured,’ meaning there’s collateral) while also retaining the exciting upside potential of participating in the company’s growth if it performs well, especially given its bold Bitcoin investment strategy. The fact that this loan is ‘secured’ adds an extra layer of confidence for investors, indicating a lower risk profile compared to unsecured debt. This substantial funding, as reported by Investigate, provides Satsuma with the financial muscle to execute its ambitious plans. Satsuma’s Strategic Evolution: Why a Strong Bitcoin Investment Treasury? Satsuma Technology’s journey has seen a notable strategic pivot, highlighted by its rebranding from Tao Alpha and a clear declaration of intent to strengthen its Bitcoin treasury strategy. This isn’t just about holding some digital assets; it’s a deliberate and calculated move that reflects a deeper understanding of macroeconomics and the evolving financial landscape. Why would an AI infrastructure company commit to a robust Bitcoin investment strategy? Inflation Hedge and Store of Value: In an era of increasing global economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures, many corporations are looking for alternatives to traditional fiat currencies. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ is seen by many as a decentralized, scarce asset that can act as a hedge against inflation and a reliable store of value over the long term. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap (21 million coins) contrasts sharply with the potentially infinite supply of fiat currencies, which can be devalued by central bank policies. This scarcity is a core tenet of its appeal as a long-term Bitcoin investment . Strategic Diversification: For a forward-thinking company like Satsuma, adding Bitcoin to its treasury provides diversification away from traditional assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk in the long run. Alignment with Innovation: As an AI infrastructure company, Satsuma operates at the forefront of technological innovation. Embracing Bitcoin, a groundbreaking digital asset, aligns with its core identity and vision for the future. It signals a willingness to adopt pioneering technologies not just in its primary business but also in its financial management. This commitment to a Bitcoin investment strategy positions Satsuma Technology among a growing list of public companies that are recognizing Bitcoin’s potential beyond mere speculation, viewing it as a legitimate treasury asset.

2025-07-24 10:35:24+00:00,Sustainable Crypto Mining: Bitzero’s Bold $25M Boost for a Greener Future,"BitcoinWorld Sustainable Crypto Mining: Bitzero’s Bold $25M Boost for a Greener Future In a significant stride towards a more environmentally conscious digital economy, the crypto mining landscape is witnessing a pivotal shift. One firm leading this charge, Bitzero, has recently secured a substantial $25 million in funding, earmarking it for a monumental expansion into sustainable crypto mining . This investment isn’t just about growth; it’s a powerful statement about the future of digital asset creation, emphasizing efficiency, profitability, and environmental responsibility. For anyone interested in the intersection of finance, technology, and ecological stewardship, Bitzero’s latest move offers a compelling glimpse into what’s possible. What Does Bitzero’s $25 Million Investment Mean for Sustainable Crypto Mining ? Bitzero’s recent capital injection, as reported by The Block, is a game-changer. The $25 million will primarily be utilized to acquire 2,900 state-of-the-art Bitmain S21 Pro miners. For those familiar with the intricacies of crypto mining hardware, the S21 Pro is a beacon of efficiency, known for its superior hashing power and improved energy consumption compared to older models. This strategic acquisition is projected to elevate Bitzero’s annual revenue by an impressive $10 million, showcasing a clear path to both financial success and environmental benefit. This isn’t merely an upgrade; it’s a strategic move that solidifies Bitzero’s commitment to low-carbon operations. The company’s existing footprint spans North America and Europe, regions increasingly prioritizing renewable energy sources. By focusing on hydro-powered mining, Bitzero is not just reducing its carbon footprint but also setting a precedent for how large-scale crypto operations can align with global sustainability goals. Why is Sustainable Crypto Mining More Crucial Than Ever Before? The conversation around crypto mining has often been overshadowed by concerns about its energy consumption. Traditional mining operations, especially those reliant on fossil fuels, have faced criticism for their environmental impact. This has led to a growing demand from investors, regulators, and the public for greener alternatives. Sustainable crypto mining addresses these concerns head-on by leveraging renewable energy sources such as hydropower, solar, wind, and geothermal. The benefits extend beyond environmental stewardship: Reduced Carbon Footprint: Minimizes greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change mitigation. Lower Operational Costs: Renewable energy can often provide more stable and predictable energy costs compared to volatile fossil fuel markets. Enhanced Reputation: Companies adopting sustainable practices build trust and appeal to a broader, environmentally conscious investor base. Regulatory Compliance: Positions firms favorably amidst increasing global regulations targeting energy-intensive industries. Long-Term Viability: Ensures the industry’s future by aligning with global efforts towards a net-zero economy. Bitzero’s focus on hydro-powered solutions positions it at the forefront of this critical evolution, demonstrating that profitability and planetary health can go hand-in-hand. How Does Bitzero’s Hydro-Powered Approach Champion Green Crypto Mining ? Bitzero’s operational model is built on the foundation of hydropower, a renewable energy source that harnesses the kinetic energy of flowing water to generate electricity. This method is lauded for its minimal environmental impact compared to fossil fuels, producing virtually no greenhouse gas emissions during operation. The strategic choice of North America and Europe for its operations is not coincidental. Both continents boast abundant hydroelectric resources and robust energy grids capable of supporting large-scale mining activities. By strategically locating its facilities near these hydro-powered sources, Bitzero achieves several key advantages: Consistent Energy Supply: Unlike solar or wind, hydropower often provides a more consistent and reliable energy flow, reducing downtime and optimizing mining efficiency. Cost Efficiency: Access to cheap, abundant renewable energy directly translates to lower operational expenses, enhancing profitability. Environmental Leadership: Operating with a near-zero carbon footprint distinguishes Bitzero as a leader in responsible digital asset creation. Community Integration: Often, hydropower projects are integrated into existing regional energy infrastructures, fostering positive relationships with local communities and utilities. This commitment to hydro-power illustrates Bitzero’s holistic approach to sustainable crypto mining , ensuring that its expansion is not just about scale, but also about setting a benchmark for environmental excellence.

If you are one of the curious minds who are keen on what the future might hold, this analysis is for you. Bitcoin Takes Center Stage as Capital Rotates Again? Recent data shows a reversion to “Bitcoin season,” marked by robust inflows into BTC.

However, the 13.26% surge in trading volume hints at hectic repositioning. Altcoin Season on Pause? The Altcoin Season Index at only 34/100 signals that fewer top altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin.

2025-07-24 11:01:08+00:00,"Crypto wrap: BTC steady but PUMP, Flare, and Aptos among big altcoin losers","The cryptocurrency market remains largely bullish, but traders are reeling from a sharp downturn seen during the Asian hours on July 24. As most altcoins flipped negative on the 24 hour timeframe, the global market capitalization fell 1.5% to $3.89 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, global trading volume over the past 24 hours reached $225 billion, up 20% amid heightened activity. But as most analysts note, the volatile conditions aside, market sentiment leans bullish. In the short term, attention is on the significant altcoin declines. PUMP, Flare, and Aptos rank among biggest losers today, even as Bitcoin shows resilience. Over $960 million liquidated as altcoins fall Crypto market’s sharp decline has come amid more than $960 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. According to Coinglass data , total liquidations jumped more than 260% in the past 24 hours, the majority of those wiped out being long positions. Data shows $828 million in bullish bets wiped out in the past day, a lot of this coming on the back of traders being caught off-guard by sharp altcoin declines. Per Coinglass, leveraged positions with Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP contributed significantly to the liquidated longs tally. Bitcoin saw $81 million in leveraged positions rekt. The downturn appears driven by profit-taking following recent market highs, as well as macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin steady as BTC price rebounds to $118k While Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to keep bears off following its run to a new all-time high, the bellwether crypto continues to demonstrate stability. Bulls have rebounded to highs of $118,377 after a brief stall below $117k. As altcoins shed some gains, this resilience has Bitcoin’s dominance back above 61%. Ethereum dominance is at 11%. Bitcoin’s price has hovered around $117,000–$118,000 this week, supported by robust capital flows and institutional demand.

The cryptocurrency market remains largely bullish, but traders are reeling from a sharp downturn seen during the Asian hours on July 24. As most altcoins flipped negative on the 24 hour timeframe, the global market capitalization fell 1.5% to $3.89 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap data. Meanwhile, global trading volume over the past 24 hours reached $225 billion, up 20% amid heightened activity. But as most analysts note, the volatile conditions aside, market sentiment leans bullish. In the short term, attention is on the significant altcoin declines. PUMP, Flare, and Aptos rank among biggest losers today, even as Bitcoin shows resilience. Over $960 million liquidated as altcoins fall Crypto market’s sharp decline has come amid more than $960 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours. According to Coinglass data , total liquidations jumped more than 260% in the past 24 hours, the majority of those wiped out being long positions. Data shows $828 million in bullish bets wiped out in the past day, a lot of this coming on the back of traders being caught off-guard by sharp altcoin declines. Per Coinglass, leveraged positions with Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL) and XRP contributed significantly to the liquidated longs tally. Bitcoin saw $81 million in leveraged positions rekt. The downturn appears driven by profit-taking following recent market highs, as well as macroeconomic uncertainties. Bitcoin steady as BTC price rebounds to $118k While Bitcoin (BTC) has failed to keep bears off following its run to a new all-time high, the bellwether crypto continues to demonstrate stability. Bulls have rebounded to highs of $118,377 after a brief stall below $117k. As altcoins shed some gains, this resilience has Bitcoin’s dominance back above 61%. Ethereum dominance is at 11%. Bitcoin’s price has hovered around $117,000–$118,000 this week, supported by robust capital flows and institutional demand. Notably, on-chain metrics indicate traders are showing some cautious optimism.

The milestone attests to the significant progress Binance has made in its relentless quest to expand the token’s utility and integrations. But there’s also another reason why BNB’s ATH should be a cause for cheer, even for those not holding the asset: it may be the first signs that an altcoin season is coming. BNB Goes ATH On July 23, BNB hit its all-time high of over $800 per token, giving it a market cap of around $112B . Not bad for a token that launched eight years ago priced at $0.15 and which is now a top five crypto asset. During the intervening period, Binance and BNB have both been on quite the ride, complete with the ups and downs that are characteristic of crypto. But lately, it’s been almost exclusively Up Only for the Binance ecosystem and this progress has been reflected on the charts as BNB’s momentum looks poised to send it higher still. From a technical perspective, there are plenty of reasons that can be attributed to BNB’s multi-year ascent. The token boasts a Sharpe ratio of 2.5, indicating that for every dollar of risk taken, the return was $2.5. This means that BNB has experienced significantly lower drawdowns compared to most cryptos and traditional market indices, offering investors a more stable and attractive risk-reward profile over the past five years. It’s not quite Bitcoin, but it is BNB – the second “B” former Binance CEO CZ used to jokingly remind his followers not to bet against. But putting its superior Sharpe ratio and relatively low volatility aside, there may be a simpler reason why BNB has broken out in the past week: it was its turn. Bitcoin has done Bitcoin things all year. And in recent weeks, ETH has finally started to move up. The next candidate on the list is BNB, both on account of its market capitalization and deep integration. BNB is everywhere, and unlike BTC, its holders are even willing to use it for payments and rewards. BNB Utility Fuels Value Flywheel It would be fair to say that BNB began life as an exchange token. It would also be fair to say that it has long since escaped that box. While Binance’s shadow still looms large over the exchange landscape, using BNB to obtain discounted trading fees is just one use case among many. As the Binance ecosystem has expanded over the last five years, so have the places where BNB is accepted. It’s still an integral part of Binance’s global exchange and BNB Chain of course, but it’s also transcended these ecosystems to gain its own trajectory. Beyond blockchain, BNB is expanding into real-world use cases like payments via Binance Pay and travel bookings on Travala.com , bridging digital assets with everyday life. Institutional adoption is also growing, with corporate treasury demand even surpassing Ethereum’s. Supporting this ecosystem is BNB’s deflationary tokenomics: an auto-burn mechanism has permanently removed 31% of the total supply, enhancing the notion of scarcity and driving long-term value. On Binance’s centralized exchange, BNB holders get their share of perks including access to token sales and staking opportunities that lock up supply and incentivize long-term holding. Meanwhile, BNB Chain’s multi-layer framework, including its Layer 1 as well as the opBNB Layer 2, continue to drive demand for the native asset. Elsewhere it’s being used in everything from decentralized storage on Greenfield to serving as DeFi collateral. Outside of ETH, no other asset has this level of everyday utility and adoption. And that’s why BNB is flying. Wen Alt Season? While there’s no question that BNB has followed BTC and ETH’s lead in rallying strongly, the question of whether this means alt season is imminent has still to be settled. Definitions of this period, during which the long tail of crypto assets outperform majors, vary, but Blockchaincenter’s index holds that when 75% of the top 50 coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days, alt season has arrived. Its index currently sits at 39, but briefly flirted with 60 in recent days. We’re not quite there, in other words, but we’re close. Sentiment among seasoned crypto traders appears to be that alt season will arrive but that it will be shorter than previous cycles. Potentially on course to kick in by early to mid-August, this could see altcoins significantly increase their total capitalization for several months in succession. Despite this, many alts are still down significantly on their previous ATH will struggle to regain this territory – even ETH is still down 30% from its all-time high, despite its bullish performance over the past 30 days.

2025-07-24 11:05:04+00:00,Did the U.S. government just dump $20B in Bitcoin?,"A rumor has been spreading in the past week or so that the U.S. government may have quietly dumped nearly 170,000 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth around $20 billion in total. Namely, while the Freedom of Information Request response from the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) did disclose a total of 28,988 BTC in holdings, valued at approximately $3.4 billion, the fact remains that other federal departments hold the cryptocurrency as well. In total, the government still holds nearly 198,000 BTC across various wallets owned by the FBI, DOJ, DEA, and several U.S. Attorney’s Offices, which translates to about $23.5 billion, as the most recent data published by Arkham Intelligence suggests. U.S. Government crypto moves. Source: Arkham Government crypto moves Some of the government’s BTC holdings have been partially liquidated, for example, around 41,700 BTC of the 51,680 BTC seized from James Zhong’s Silk Road stash. However, Arkham confirms that no tracked wallets have made any such moves in over four months, suggesting no ongoing liquidation activity. Likewise, not all seized Bitcoin has been legally forfeited, and some of it may be held pending court decisions. This has created a lot of confusion regarding how much “digital gold” the government really owns as opposed to just holding for the time being. Bitcoin price remains stable Despite the rumors, the Bitcoin price has remained relatively stable.

2025-07-24 11:15:10+00:00,Altcoin Season Hope Dim as Traders Unwind Bullish Bets: Crypto Daybook Americas,"By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Bitcoin''s (BTC) consolidation continues to take the wind out of the bull run in the broader market that had raised hopes for the so-called alt season marked by prolonged outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies. Over the past 24 hours, major altcoins have experienced a significant decline, led by a double-digit drop in the payments-focused XRP and an 8% slide in SOL. The CoinDesk 80 Index, which tracks the performance of altcoins, has dropped over 7% while the CoinDesk 20 Index, which is dominated by bitcoin and ether, has declined by 4%. ""The crypto market took a nosedive, losing almost 4% of its market cap over the last 24 hours. Without bitcoin''s growth, altcoins, which had been driving the market upwards in previous days, found themselves on sale. Forty-eight of the top 100 altcoins are losing double-digit rates over 24 hours, while only three are growing,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. Amid all this, social media is abuzz with posts about some $2 billion worth of ether waiting to be unstaked , with over 475 Ethereum validators awaiting exit. (check chart of the day section). Some are drawing parallels with January 2024, when large unstaking marked a temporary price top. The latest surge in unstaking appears to be driven by the soaring ether borrowing rates on decentralized platforms like Aave, which have diminished the appeal of looping strategies designed to boost ether staking yields. Typically, these strategies involve users depositing liquidity staking (LST) or liquid restaking tokens (LRT) as collateral on platforms like AAVE and borrow ETH. The borrowed ETH is again converted to LRT and LSTs and redeposited, creating a loop. The strategy works when staking yields are greater than borrowing costs. However, with borrowing costs on the rise, the loop is likely being reversed, leading traders to rush to repay loans, exit LST/LRT, and reclaim ETH. ""The real trigger is soaring ETH borrowing rates since July 16 (peaking at 18%). This forced mass unwinding of ETH leverage loops on Aave, as negative yield spreads crushed profitability. Traders rushed to repay loans, exit LST/LRT positions, and reclaim ETH — causing depegs and queue congestion,"" pseudonymous observer Degen Station noted on X. It added that arbitrageurs are now scooping up LSTs and LRTs at a discount to redeem them for ether, worsening the issue, while demand for new staking remains strong. To cut to the chase, the large queue for unstaking is not necessarily a bearish signal. In other key news, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said that the company is planning to re-enter the U.S. with stablecoin offerings for payments, interbank settlements, and trading. In traditional markets, major currencies traded flat against the U.S. dollar, except for the risk-sensitive AUD/USD pair, which crossed above resistance at 0.66.

2025-07-24 11:16:57+00:00,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 24, 2025","Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by another 5.6%, dipping below $4 trillion, now standing at $3.91 trillion. The market is down today, with the large majority of the top 100 coins per market capitalization turning red. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $264 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap fell below $4 trillion; Large majority of top 100 coins have dropped in 24 hours; BTC and ETH are both down, trading at $118,256 and $3,574; Market sentiment decreased slightly today; US ETH spot ETFs continue the inflow streak, US BTC spot ETFs see further outflows; ’Investor appetite for the two biggest blockchains is undeniable’; ’The real opportunity lies at the intersection of Bitcoin and Ethereum’. Crypto Winners & Losers Over the past 24 hours, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have turned red. Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by only 0.2% in a day, meaning it’s unchanged. The current price is $118,256, holding above the $118,000 level. BTC’s is the lowest fall on this list. Then, Ethereum (ETH) is down by 2.6% over the same period. It’s now trading at $3,574. This is the second lowest decrease. Two coins saw double-digit drops. XRP (XRP) fell the most in this category: 12.1% to $3.05. Also, Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 10.7%, now trading at $0.2303. The other coins in this category saw decreases between 3% and 8% each. In the top 100 coins category, only four coins are green, and only one had an increase above 0.3%. Story (IP) appreciated 3.8% to $5.13. At the same time, some 25 coins recorded double-digit drops. The highest of these are 16.3% and 15.6% by Aptos (APT) and Flare (FLR) , now trading at $4.59 and $0.02205. Moreover, PUMP , the native token of Pump.Fun , dropped 20% in 24 hours after founder Alon Cohen said there is no immediate token airdrop. “We want to make sure that it is a meaningful airdrop and it is executed well,” Cohen said . “We’re actually focusing on bringing back a lot of that attention and hype to our ecosystem. That being said, the airdrop is not going to be taking place in the immediate future.” Allon speaks about the pumpfun airdrop live on threadguy stream, ""We want to reward OG pumpfun users"" pic.twitter.com/gdfE7H4oRV — ً (@0xsyste) July 23, 2025 Meanwhile, bankrupt crypto exchange FTX said it would begin its next round of cash distributions to creditors on or around 30 September. The payments will be processed through FTX’s designated distribution partners, including BitGo , Kraken , and Payoneer . Industry is Shifting to Bitcoin-Ethereum Interconnection James Harris, Group CEO of digital asset firm Tesseract , commented that “crypto hitting $4 trillion in total market cap earlier this month was a serious milestone, and while we’ve seen a bit of a pullback in the past couple of days, the rally has been driven by a combination of structural and cyclical forces.” “It’s a powerful trifecta: regulatory clarity, macro easing, and corporate adoption. Together, they’re pushing crypto from speculative asset to serious portfolio contender. That said, these same forces can reverse — so while the momentum is real, disciplined risk management remains essential.” Also, Dom Harz, co-founder of hybrid chain BOB , commented that Ethereum ETFs saw the third-largest day of inflows in history this week. They also celebrated their one-year anniversary yesterday, coming far since their launch. The high inflows may be the result of buy-in from investors who “missed out” on BTC, which hit a new record high of $122,000 the week prior. “Either way, investor appetite for the two biggest blockchains is undeniable,” Harz says. What’s more, this momentum is not showing signs of slowing down. ETH is “outperforming the original blockchain so far this month. Institutional investors are taking note, and many major players are announcing plans to grow their ETH treasuries.” Therefore, Harz argues, “the real opportunity lies at the intersection of Bitcoin and Ethereum.” Fast developments in innovations like BitVM and Bitcoin DeFi are making “the idea that investors must look beyond Bitcoin for DeFi opportunities” outdated. “The industry is experiencing a shift toward a more interconnected future, where Bitcoin’s robust security and Ethereum’s programmability align to drive broader adoption without compromising decentralization,” Harz concludes. Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $118,256. Its intraday high was $119,197, after which the price fell to the intraday low of $117,422, before returning to the current level. The coin still stands above $118,000 and is trying to hold on to it. It has dipped below this level several times over the past 24 hours. Observers are now looking to see if it will manage to keep the level and move upwards again, or if it will drop below it, possibly into the $116,700 zone. Keep an eye on the $120,094 mark, after which the price could move above $122,000 and towards $128,000.

2025-07-24 11:18:12+00:00,Crypto Market Surges Today: Three Major Catalysts Fueling the Rally,"The crypto market advanced on Thursday, buoyed by institutional inflows, political support in Washington, and renewed risk appetite in altcoins. With visibility a growing priority for emerging projects in this bullish environment, firms like Outset PR are stepping in to shape how narratives align with momentum. Bitcoin (BTC) hovered above $118,000, extending gains after bouncing off technical support earlier this week. Ethereum retreated modestly but remains up nearly 9% month-to-date. Below is a review of three key drivers behind the move: regulatory clarity, ETF momentum, and capital rotation into altcoins. 1. Political Tailwinds and Regulatory Clarity The biggest boost to the market this week comes from pro-crypto legislation in the United States. Two pivotal bills—the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY for Payment Stablecoins Act—have gained strong support in Congress, with backing from the current administration and influential financial figures. The Market Impact: The GENIUS Act provides a regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance and use, encouraging innovation while ensuring consumer protection. The CLARITY Act establishes clear guidelines for how stablecoins can be used for payments, addressing longstanding compliance concerns. This wave of crypto-friendly regulation signals a seismic shift in Washington’s stance on digital assets, offering long-awaited legal clarity that institutional investors demand. It sets the stage for the mainstream adoption of crypto as a viable component of the global financial system. 2. Institutional Inflows via Bitcoin ETFs The second catalyst is the ongoing wave of institutional demand, primarily funneled through spot Bitcoin ETFs approved earlier this year. Industry giants like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have continued to accumulate Bitcoin on behalf of their clients. Key Stats: Bitcoin ETFs have seen billions in inflows over the last two months. Institutional accumulation has helped Bitcoin maintain support levels above $115,000, despite short-term volatility. Trading volume on regulated crypto exchanges has spiked, a sign of growing confidence among large investors. These ETFs have effectively bridged the gap between traditional finance and digital assets, opening the door for 401(k) funds, hedge funds, and family offices to enter the market without touching crypto wallets or exchanges. The result is a stable foundation for price growth, anchored in long-term capital. 3. Altcoin Season Ignites as Bitcoin Dominance Drops The third factor fueling today’s rally is the resurgence of altcoin activity, often referred to as the beginning of “altseason.” As Bitcoin consolidates gains, traders are rotating capital into smaller-cap cryptocurrencies that tend to outperform during bull runs. What''s Driving It: Bitcoin dominance has fallen by over 7% in the last 30 days, indicating a shift toward altcoins. Projects in the AI, DeFi, meme, and gaming sectors are seeing double-digit daily gains. Tokens like Solana, Chainlink, and various Layer-2 ecosystems are attracting fresh liquidity. This trend marks the return of risk-on sentiment, where investors are more willing to chase high-reward opportunities. While volatility may rise, it also opens the door for significant upside in under-the-radar tokens. In a Fragmented Narrative, Outset PR Sharpens the Message As crypto projects race to capitalize on the current rally, narrative clarity and timing have never mattered more — and that’s where Outset PR has carved out a competitive edge.

Campaigns are not dictated by templates or generic placements — they are built to move with the market. Outset PR’s approach includes: Editorial precision: Writers with journalistic and analytics backgrounds tailor content for both impact and indexability.

Best known for winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls, Pippen recently took to X to share his 2026 price predictions for top cryptocurrencies. He even asked his 729,000 followers to vote on which ones they believe could actually happen. Pippen has long shown support for Bitcoin and has even claimed to have spoken with Satoshi Nakamoto in a dream. But this time, he’s going beyond Bitcoin, showing love for Ethereum, XRP, and Solana. The big question is, are these predictions based on anything solid, or are they just for fun? Pippen’s 2026 Crypto Price Predictions According to Pippen, by 2026: Bitcoin could soar to $233,000 Ethereum might hit $10,000 XRP could reach $10 Solana might jump to $1,000 He also referenced Elon Musk’s recent promise that by next year, Tesla’s Optimus robots would be delivering food at the company’s new diner while people wait for their cars to charge. Which one of these will happen in 2026: • Bitcoin will hit 233k • $ETH will hit $10k • $SOL will hit $1k • $XRP will hit $10 • Your UBER driver will tell you about the @game5ball • Optimus will deliver you food • Aliens will invade • 2pac returns — Scottie Pippen (@ScottiePippen) July 24, 2025 If that wasn’t futuristic enough, Pippen asked followers whether they believe Earth will be invaded by aliens in 2026. While some users were amused, others focused on the price targets.

2025-07-24 11:25:18+00:00,Mysterious Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Awakens After 14.5 Years,"BitcoinWorld Mysterious Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Awakens After 14.5 Years In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where market movements can be triggered by a whisper, the sudden activity of a dormant Bitcoin wallet can send ripples of intrigue and speculation across the globe. Imagine a digital treasure chest, locked away and untouched for over a decade, suddenly showing a sign of life. This isn’t a scene from a sci-fi movie; it’s the reality of a recent event that has captured the attention of the crypto community. What Just Happened with This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet? The crypto analytics platform Lookonchain recently brought to light a fascinating development via X (formerly Twitter): a Bitcoin whale wallet, holding a staggering 3,962 BTC – an amount valued at approximately $468 million at the time of the report – has stirred from its 14.5-year slumber. The wallet, which had been inactive since its creation, made a minimal test transaction of 0.0018 BTC (worth around $218). This isn’t just any transaction; it’s a significant event for several reasons: Long-Term Dormancy: 14.5 years is an exceptionally long period for such a large sum of Bitcoin to remain untouched. This suggests the owner either lost access, was a very early adopter with extreme conviction, or simply forgot about it. Significant Holdings: With nearly 4,000 BTC, this wallet represents a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, making its movements potentially impactful. The ‘Test’ Transaction: The small amount sent is characteristic of a test transaction, typically performed to verify wallet access and functionality before a larger transfer. This indicates the owner has regained or confirmed control. The identity of the wallet owner remains shrouded in mystery, as is common with pseudonymous blockchain transactions. However, the sheer volume of BTC involved naturally leads to questions about the potential implications for the broader market. Why Does an Awakened Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Matter? The awakening of such a long-inactive, large-volume dormant Bitcoin wallet can spark a flurry of speculation and analysis within the crypto ecosystem. Here’s why it’s a big deal: 1. Potential Market Impact: Selling Pressure: The primary concern is that the whale might be preparing to sell their substantial holdings. A sudden influx of 3,962 BTC onto exchanges could create significant selling pressure, potentially leading to a price drop, especially in a less liquid market. Market Confidence: Conversely, if the whale moves the funds to a secure, non-exchange wallet, or simply holds them, it could be interpreted as a sign of continued confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value, potentially boosting sentiment. 2. Historical Precedents: Historically, movements from long-dormant wallets have often preceded significant market events. While not every awakening leads to a crash, they are closely watched. For instance, the movement of early Bitcoin blocks (mined in 2010 or earlier) often generates similar buzz due to the massive unrealized gains involved and the potential for large-scale selling. Notable Dormant Wallet Awakenings & Potential Outcomes Year of Awakening Amount (BTC) Dormancy Period Common Speculation Recent (2024) 3,962 14.5 years Market dump, security transfer, lost keys found 2020 50 11 years Early miner selling, testing old keys 2021 1,000+ 8+ years Institutional movement, long-term holder redistribution Who Are These Bitcoin Whales, Anyway? The term ‘Bitcoin whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of Bitcoin. These are often early adopters, institutional investors, or large-scale traders whose actions can significantly influence market dynamics due to the sheer volume of their holdings. Their movements are tracked by blockchain analytics firms like Lookonchain, Arkham Intelligence, and Glassnode, providing insights into potential market shifts. The awakening of a dormant Bitcoin wallet belonging to such a whale is particularly noteworthy because their decisions can create a ripple effect, influencing smaller investors and traders. Are they about to take profits? Are they moving funds for security reasons? Or are they simply re-organizing their portfolio? These questions drive the narrative around such events. What Could Trigger a Dormant Bitcoin Wallet to Awaken? There are several plausible reasons why a wallet that has been dormant for nearly 15 years might suddenly become active: Rediscovery of Lost Keys: One of the most common scenarios. An early adopter might have found an old hard drive, a forgotten paper wallet, or recovered mnemonic phrases. Inheritance or Estate Settlement: The original owner may have passed away, and their heirs or estate executors have finally gained access to the funds. This process can often take years.

The analyst noted , “Wave-(C) of 4 has completed a 5-wave move to the downside, the pattern is now technically complete.A break above $3.25 would be the first confirmation that wave-4 has bottomed. For now, the possibility of another low remains on the table.” The Elliott Wave Theory, often used by technical analysts to predict market cycles, suggests that XRP is currently completing wave-4, a corrective phase following its pullback to the psychological price of $3.00. At the time of this writing, XRP had gained some momentum to trade at $3.09, according to CoinGecko data . Crypto pundit XRPunkie shares similar sentiments that XRP is presently at the wave 4 correction phase. The techical analyst pointed out that XRP may have completed its wave 4 correction, though a dip to $2.64 remains possible before Wave 5 begins, which could see a bullish run to $5.50. XRPunkie added, “Pullbacks are part of the game. Enjoy the ride to higher prices soon.” Notably, wave-4 corrections typically precede explosive upward moves, and a confirmed breakout above $3.25 would invalidate bearish structures, signaling that wave-5 has begun. Conclusion XRP’s battle at $3.25 could be the turning point for a fresh wave of upside depending on whether wave 4 has bottomed at the present price of $3.09. If this is the case, the next major target might be $5.50, a level not seen in XRP’s history and a potential signal that a new bull phase is underway.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10137/crypto-breakout-watch-3-25-surge-could-ignite-xrp-s-run-to-5-50,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,News|Ripple,BTC,"Crypto Breakout Watch: $3.25 Surge Could Ignite XRP’s Run to $5.50.

The techical analyst pointed out that XRP may have completed its wave 4 correction, though a dip to $2.64 remains possible before Wave 5 begins, which could see a bullish run to $5.50. XRPunkie added, “Pullbacks are part of the game. Enjoy the ride to higher prices soon.” Notably, wave-4 corrections typically precede explosive upward moves, and a confirmed breakout above $3.25 would invalidate bearish structures, signaling that wave-5 has begun. Conclusion XRP’s battle at $3.25 could be the turning point for a fresh wave of upside depending on whether wave 4 has bottomed at the present price of $3.09. If this is the case, the next major target might be $5.50, a level not seen in XRP’s history and a potential signal that a new bull phase is underway."

2025-07-24 11:45:16+00:00,XRP Eyes Record High Despite Recent Price Dip,"XRP remains positioned for a potential breakout despite a sharp pullback in the last 24 hours, according to market observers. The token saw a 10% decline, falling to $3.21, but analysts suggest its long-term trajectory could still push it beyond its previous all-time high if the broader crypto market momentum continues. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, deputy CEO at Bitpanda, noted that while predicting exact levels is challenging in fast-moving markets, XRP surpassing its 2018 peak would not be surprising if conditions remain favorable and capital continues to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins. Altcoin Season Provides Tailwinds for XRP XRP recently touched a year-to-date high of $3.66 but has yet to retest its all-time high of $3.84, set in January 2018. Analysts attribute the potential for further gains to the ongoing strength across the altcoin sector, driven by a shift in investor sentiment and capital flows. CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index, which gauges the market’s appetite for altcoins relative to Bitcoin, transitioned from “Bitcoin Season” to “Altcoin Season” on Sunday. This shift aligns with a notable drop in Bitcoin’s dominance, which has decreased by over 5% in the past month as traders explore opportunities in alternative cryptocurrencies. Enzersdorfer-Konrad emphasized that the 3rd larget crypto’s movement is heavily tied to broader altcoin sentiment, suggesting that continued liquidity and confidence in the altcoin space will be crucial for sustaining the rally. “XRP tends to be highly sensitive to broader altcoin sentiment and regulatory narratives,” he said, adding that the next phase will depend on whether momentum expands across other altcoins or remains concentrated in select tokens. Analysts See Upside Potential Towards $10 Crypto analyst Dom recently projected that XRP could climb to a range between $7 and $10 if the current market dynamics continue to favor altcoins . However, the outlook for the crypto remains intertwined with the overall performance of the crypto market, with investors watching for signals of sustained altcoin strength. For now, XRP’s path higher will rely on the market’s ability to maintain momentum while navigating the volatility that has long characterized the digital asset sector, as the token eyes reclaim and surpass its historical peak in the coming months.

2025-07-24 11:51:00+00:00,Here Are 6 Ways to Know It’s Time to Sell Your Crypto,"Investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can be extremely rewarding, but it’s also very risky. Knowing when to sell is just as critical as knowing when to buy. That’s because selling too early can mean missing out on potentially life-changing gains, while selling too late can lead to devastating losses. Timing the market is very challenging, but there are clear signs that can undoubtedly help you out. In this article, we take a look at six key signs that it might be time to sell your crypto (or at least some of it). You Need the Money This is the most practical reason to sell your cryptocurrency. If you need money for a major expense that cannot tolerate any delays, such as a medical bill, selling some (or all, if needed) of your cryptocurrency can be a smart move. Investments are not just about growing wealth. They are supposed to support your life and make it better. Crypto markets are highly volatile, and holding on during a prolonged downturn while needing funds on hand can put you in a tough situation. Remember, nothing is more important than your health – if selling helps you meet an urgent bill, it may be the right choice, regardless of what the charts are saying right now. You Have Hit Your Target Price One of the most basic but effective strategies is to simply set a target price before you buy. Now, this could be a specific dollar amount or a percentage gain. For example, you may want to sell once your investment doubles, or when BTC’s price hits $1 million. Sticking to your plan helps remove emotion from the decision. Many investors get greedy when the prices start to increase drastically and hold on for too long. This often leads to sharp corrections that simply wipe out your gains. Setting a target also helps you lock in profits and reduce exposure. Also, keep in mind that you don’t have to sell everything at once – selling part of your position when you reach your goal can be a very balanced approach. The Fundamentals Have Changed Every single cryptocurrency is tied to a set of assumptions. These can include various things – from the strength of the development team, user growth, regulatory clarity, overall merits, and many more. When those assumptions change – it’s time to reassess. For instance, if a project starts delaying its roadmap, fails to deliver promised upgrades, starts losing key developers or team members that were part of your original investment thesis – your reasoning might no longer apply. Another interesting scenario is competition – if a new project enters the space that offers a better version of the same product, your investment thesis might weaken. In cases like these, holding on based on past performance could be a mistake. It might be better to exit and look for better and stronger opportunities. Market Sentiment Turns EXTREMELY Bullish At a glance, this might sound quite counterintuitive, but extreme optimism can oftentimes be a warning sign. When everyone is talking about buying, and prices are increasing fast, this could signal a market top. During crypto bull runs, prices often move beyond what the project’s fundamentals support. Valuations tend to become incredibly inflated. In many cases, this is followed by very sharp corrections. You can track sentiment indicators such as Google Trends, social media chatter, fear-and-greed indexes, and others – all of it can help. If hype reaches levels that you think are unsustainable – it may be time to take some profits off the table. You Are Overexposed to One Asset Diversification is a basic risk management rule. If one of your crypto positions grows to become a very large part of your portfolio, your overall risk increases. For instance, if one of your altcoins that you bought early on has taken off and now makes up 60% of your holdings, a sudden drop in that coin could impact your whole portfolio. Rebalancing is a very common strategy. This means selling part of the overgrown position and reinvesting the proceeds into other assets or holding it in cash. It helps keep your portfolio aligned with your risk tolerance. I understand that sometimes this may feel like giving up gains, but it’s a long-term strategy to reduce volatility and avoid major losses. You are No Longer Comfortable With the Risk The crypto market is not for everyone. It is quite common for people to enter during bull markets when euphoria is high and prices move fast. But when the volatility goes the other way, many realize that they can’t handle the stress. If price swings keep you up at night or cause emotional stress, you may be overexposed. Selling some or all of your holdings can help reduce anxiety, which may also translate into overall improvement of your financial well-being. Investing should be based on your risk tolerance, not just the potential rewards. There is nothing wrong with stepping back if the risk is no longer acceptable for you.

2025-07-24 11:55:23+00:00,Unveiling the Mystery: A Gigantic Bitcoin Whale Transfer Shakes the Market,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Mystery: A Gigantic Bitcoin Whale Transfer Shakes the Market In the often-unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, certain events stand out, capturing the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. One such seismic event recently occurred: a colossal Bitcoin whale transfer . Imagine nearly half a billion dollars in Bitcoin, previously dormant for years, suddenly stirring and moving to a new digital address. This isn’t just a transaction; it’s a profound signal that sends ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. What does such a massive Bitcoin whale transfer signify, and why should you care? The Awakening: What Exactly Happened in This Gigantic Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The crypto community was abuzz when news broke of a long-inactive Bitcoin (BTC) whale making an extraordinary move. According to Onchain Lens on X , an entity holding a staggering 3,962.62 BTC, valued at approximately $468.67 million at the time of the transfer, shifted its entire holdings to a brand-new wallet. This monumental Bitcoin whale transfer wasn’t impulsive; it was preceded by a small, almost imperceptible test transaction, a common practice among large holders to ensure the main transfer goes smoothly. To put this into perspective, a “whale” in crypto terms refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. A “dormant” whale is one whose holdings have remained untouched for an extended period, often years. The sudden activation of such a large, previously inactive wallet is rare and always triggers intense speculation. This specific Bitcoin whale transfer represents one of the largest movements from a long-term dormant address in recent memory. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale Transfer of This Magnitude Matter? The movement of hundreds of millions of dollars by a single entity is never a trivial matter, especially in a relatively nascent market like cryptocurrency. A significant Bitcoin whale transfer can have multiple implications, affecting everything from market sentiment to liquidity. Here’s why this event is so closely watched: Market Psychology: The crypto market is heavily influenced by sentiment. A large transfer from a dormant whale can be interpreted in various ways – as a precursor to selling, a repositioning for long-term holding, or even a security measure. These interpretations can sway market participants’ decisions, leading to either fear or optimism. Liquidity Dynamics: While the transfer itself doesn’t directly impact price, the possibility of these funds entering exchanges for sale could significantly increase selling pressure, potentially leading to a price drop. Conversely, if the funds are moved to a cold storage wallet, it might signal an intent to hold, reducing immediate supply. On-Chain Transparency: Unlike traditional finance, blockchain technology offers unparalleled transparency. Every Bitcoin whale transfer is recorded on the public ledger, allowing analysts to track movements and infer potential intentions, even if the identity of the whale remains anonymous. This transparency provides valuable insights into the behavior of large market players. Unpacking the Mystery: Who Could Be Behind This Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The identity of this specific whale remains shrouded in mystery, as is often the case with large crypto holdings. However, speculation runs rampant, with several theories emerging about who might be behind such a substantial Bitcoin whale transfer : Early Adopter or “Satoshi Era” Holder: Many believe these long-dormant wallets belong to early Bitcoin miners or investors who acquired BTC when it was worth mere pennies. The activation could mean they are finally moving their assets for various reasons, perhaps to secure them better or prepare for a future event. While unlikely to be Satoshi Nakamoto themselves (whose known wallets remain untouched), it could be someone from that formative period. Institutional Investor or Fund: As institutional adoption of Bitcoin grows, it’s plausible that a large fund or corporation that acquired BTC years ago is simply reorganizing its assets or transferring them to a new custodian for improved security or operational efficiency. Exchange or Custodian: Sometimes, these transfers are internal movements by exchanges or custodial services managing large amounts of client funds. They might be consolidating wallets, upgrading security protocols, or preparing for large withdrawals/deposits. “Lost and Found” Wallets: In rare cases, individuals who lost access to their early Bitcoin holdings due to forgotten passwords, corrupted drives, or misplaced hardware wallets manage to regain access. This could represent a monumental personal discovery for the whale in question. Without direct confirmation, these remain educated guesses. The beauty and challenge of blockchain lie in its pseudonymity, where actions are public but iden",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-transfer-mystery-2/,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,Crypto News|BITCOIN|BTC Movement|crypto whales|market impact|on-chain analysis,BTC,"Unveiling the Mystery: A Gigantic Bitcoin Whale Transfer Shakes the Market.

This isn’t just a transaction; it’s a profound signal that sends ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. What does such a massive Bitcoin whale transfer signify, and why should you care? The Awakening: What Exactly Happened in This Gigantic Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The crypto community was abuzz when news broke of a long-inactive Bitcoin (BTC) whale making an extraordinary move. According to Onchain Lens on X , an entity holding a staggering 3,962.62 BTC, valued at approximately $468.67 million at the time of the transfer, shifted its entire holdings to a brand-new wallet. This monumental Bitcoin whale transfer wasn’t impulsive; it was preceded by a small, almost imperceptible test transaction, a common practice among large holders to ensure the main transfer goes smoothly. To put this into perspective, a “whale” in crypto terms refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. A “dormant” whale is one whose holdings have remained untouched for an extended period, often years. The sudden activation of such a large, previously inactive wallet is rare and always triggers intense speculation. This specific Bitcoin whale transfer represents one of the largest movements from a long-term dormant address in recent memory. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale Transfer of This Magnitude Matter? The movement of hundreds of millions of dollars by a single entity is never a trivial matter, especially in a relatively nascent market like cryptocurrency. A significant Bitcoin whale transfer can have multiple implications, affecting everything from market sentiment to liquidity. Here’s why this event is so closely watched: Market Psychology: The crypto market is heavily influenced by sentiment. A large transfer from a dormant whale can be interpreted in various ways – as a precursor to selling, a repositioning for long-term holding, or even a security measure. These interpretations can sway market participants’ decisions, leading to either fear or optimism. Liquidity Dynamics: While the transfer itself doesn’t directly impact price, the possibility of these funds entering exchanges for sale could significantly increase selling pressure, potentially leading to a price drop. Conversely, if the funds are moved to a cold storage wallet, it might signal an intent to hold, reducing immediate supply. On-Chain Transparency: Unlike traditional finance, blockchain technology offers unparalleled transparency. Every Bitcoin whale transfer is recorded on the public ledger, allowing analysts to track movements and infer potential intentions, even if the identity of the whale remains anonymous. This transparency provides valuable insights into the behavior of large market players. Unpacking the Mystery: Who Could Be Behind This Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The identity of this specific whale remains shrouded in mystery, as is often the case with large crypto holdings. However, speculation runs rampant, with several theories emerging about who might be behind such a substantial Bitcoin whale transfer : Early Adopter or “Satoshi Era” Holder: Many believe these long-dormant wallets belong to early Bitcoin miners or investors who acquired BTC when it was worth mere pennies. The activation could mean they are finally moving their assets for various reasons, perhaps to secure them better or prepare for a future event. While unlikely to be Satoshi Nakamoto themselves (whose known wallets remain untouched), it could be someone from that formative period. Institutional Investor or Fund: As institutional adoption of Bitcoin grows, it’s plausible that a large fund or corporation that acquired BTC years ago is simply reorganizing its assets or transferring them to a new custodian for improved security or operational efficiency. Exchange or Custodian: Sometimes, these transfers are internal movements by exchanges or custodial services managing large amounts of client funds. They might be consolidating wallets, upgrading security protocols, or preparing for large withdrawals/deposits. “Lost and Found” Wallets: In rare cases, individuals who lost access to their early Bitcoin holdings due to forgotten passwords, corrupted drives, or misplaced hardware wallets manage to regain access. This could represent a monumental personal discovery for the whale in question. Without direct confirmation, these remain educated guesses. The beauty and challenge of blockchain lie in its pseudonymity, where actions are public but iden"

But how much truth is there behind this viral claim? Where Did This Claim Originate? The speculation started when Atlas , a known crypto and on-chain analyst on X, posted a thread noting that BlackRock and Ripple “will merge,” describing it as a natural alignment between both companies’ goals, structures, and financial strategies. Atlas claimed to have reviewed “leaked documents” showing overlaps and shared objectives. But, is there any proof or source proving this claim? Fact Check: What Do the Facts Show? No Official Announcement or Confirmation As of now, there is no official announcement from BlackRock or Ripple regarding a merger, partnership, or acquisition. Neither company has issued a press release or statement supporting the rumor. Leading crypto news outlets and mainstream business media have also not reported any deal between the two firms. No Proof for Leak Document However, Atlas claimed he looked at leaked documents, but he did not share any source in his tweet. While some theories suggest Ripple and BlackRock could be working on similar systems or share the same goals, these ideas remain speculative and are not confirmed facts. Strategic Hiring, Not a Merger Recent developments show Ripple hiring executives with backgrounds in major financial institutions, including BlackRock. While, hiring executives and aligning strategies do not amount to a corporate merger. BlackRock Will Go For XRP ETF Soon Ripple has dropped its cross-appeal , and many expect the SEC to do the same soon. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, hinted that now, just like Bitcoin and Ethereum, XRP has a clear path for an ETF. Before this, legal troubles were the biggest block for an XRP ETF in the US. With that out of the way, experts like Nate Geraci say BlackRock could be next to file. Garlinghouse didn’t say there’s an official deal with BlackRock yet, but the door is open.

Despite the bullish developments that have emerged for Ripple and XRP over the last few months, its inability to reach new highs has suggested the altcoin might not have as much strength needed to continue. Now, another bearish development has piled on as crypto analyst Tradersboat has pointed out the formation of a double top on the chart. XRP Price Double Top Says Rally Could Be Over In the analysis, Tradersboat pointed out that the XRP price has already hit a double top, which often marks the end of a rally. This comes as the altcoin has been tapping into external liquidity, and there has been an exhaustion on the buyer side. The result is the double-top above the $3.6 but still below its $3.8 peak. Naturally, a double top shows that the end is in sight and the result is usually a price crash, something the analyst alludes to. However, the chart does show that there is the possibility of one more uptrend . This is the upward sweep that will help to grab liquidity from above the $3.7 level before the trend plays out completely. In addition to the double top formation, the crypto analyst also explains that there has been a Break of Structure (BOS). Historically, Break of Structures shows that bears are beginning to take charge, adding to the already bearish intent of the double top. Both these things point to one possible end game, and that is a price crash. The XRP price had already swept the highs above to trigger the resistance at $3.6, indicated by the rejection from this level . So, a clean break was not achieved here. Given this, the analyst expects that there will be a sell-off back toward the sell-side liquidity zone, and this happens to lie below $3.4, with a possibility of further breakdown. Closing In The Green For July So far, the month of July has been quite bullish for the XRP price , pushing over 55% gains already for the month, CryptoRank shows . This is in line with the 5-year streak that has been maintained as XRP has closed each July of the last five years in the green, and 2025 is proving to be no different. However, if the altcoin does stay true to trend, then there is a possibility that the price does crash in the month of August. With an average crash of over 12% in the last three years, the analyst’s prediction could likely play out in the month of August, which remains one of the most bearish months for the XRP price .",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-forms-double-top/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO,XRP|crypto|crypto news|ripple|ripple news|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,BTC,"XRP Price Forms Double Top, This Structure Says A Crash Is Coming.

At this point, Trump stated that the US government would not sell the BTCs it held, but would look for ways to purchase new BTCs. While nearly four months have passed since the executive order establishing the Bitcoin reserve, Arkham said that the US government''s BTC holdings have not changed for four months. According to Arkham data, the US government has not moved its Bitcoin holdings in the last four months. Arkham noted that the 28,988 BTC ($3.4 billion) disclosed by the USMS represents only a fraction of the government''s total assets. “Did the US Government Sell 170,000 BTC ($20 Billion)? No. The US Marshals Service (USMS) states in a Freedom of Information Request response that they hold 28,988 BTC ($3.4 billion).

US President Donald Trump established a US national strategic Bitcoin reserve with an executive order signed in March. At this point, Trump stated that the US government would not sell the BTCs it held, but would look for ways to purchase new BTCs. While nearly four months have passed since the executive order establishing the Bitcoin reserve, Arkham said that the US government''s BTC holdings have not changed for four months. According to Arkham data, the US government has not moved its Bitcoin holdings in the last four months. Arkham noted that the 28,988 BTC ($3.4 billion) disclosed by the USMS represents only a fraction of the government''s total assets. “Did the US Government Sell 170,000 BTC ($20 Billion)? No. The US Marshals Service (USMS) states in a Freedom of Information Request response that they hold 28,988 BTC ($3.4 billion).

Members of the Sejm, the lower house of parliament in Poland, are considering a government-sponsored piece of legislation meant to regulate cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in the country and the economy built around the digital assets. Bill No. 1424 was filed on June 26 and submitted for first reading in the chamber on July 7, the Polish crypto news outlet Bitcoin.pl reported Wednesday. On July 22, deputies launched the long-awaited debate on the proposed regulations, joined by representatives of the executive power in Warsaw. Fifth of Poles already invested in cryptocurrencies, government says Addressing lawmakers from the ruling majority and the opposition, Deputy Finance Minister Jurand Drop defended the cabinet’s motion, stressing that the Central European nation is yet to adopt rules providing protection for crypto investors. “20% of investors in this market declare that they have fallen victim to some kind of fraud or abuse,” the government official pointed out, while also emphasizing: “In Poland, 18% of people already have experience investing in crypto assets. These regulations are crucial for strengthening investor and customer protection in the crypto asset market.” Polish crypto sector fears bill may spark exodus of businesses The new legislation, aimed at transposing the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets ( MiCA ) regulation into national law, has been the cause of deep concerns among the members of the local crypto community. A worrying move for them is the decision to entrust oversight to the Polish Financial Supervision Authority ( KNF ), “which is notorious for its less-than-favorable attitude toward cryptocurrencies,” as Bitcoin.pl remarked in its article. Another controversial moment has been the proposal to impose a 0.5% fee on the revenues of Polish crypto exchanges, which is not required by MiCA, while charging foreign-based trading platforms only a one-time fee of around $5,000. Representatives of Poland’s crypto industry have complained that this would hurt their ability to compete with exchanges based abroad. It may even push Polish companies to relocate to more favorable jurisdictions in order to continue to work in their own market. Lawmakers from the opposition highlighted these and other issues with the bill. Janusz Kowalski, from the right-wing conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party suggested such charges should be capped and criticized the idea to grant supervisory powers to the KNF. “Poland has enormous potential in the crypto asset innovation sector.

2025-07-24 12:28:03+00:00,Crypto groups plead for Trump to stop JPMorgan''s scheme to tax payment data,"Cryptocurrency and financial technology industry groups are calling on President Donald Trump to intervene in the “coordinated attempt” by big banks, led by JPMorgan Chase, to undermine open banking regulations by imposing fees for accessing customer financial data. The plea was outlined in a letter sent on Wednesday to the White House, signed by ten major trade associations representing fintech and digital asset firms, including the Blockchain Association and the Crypto Council for Innovation. These groups claim JPMorgan’s decision to charge third-party fintechs for access to customer account data is a “threat to innovation” and will harm the ecosystem of crypto and digital payments in the United States. JPMorgan to charge for data access Last month, JPMorgan Chase informed third-party data aggregators like Plaid and MX that it will begin charging fees when they access customer banking information. These aggregators provide the data infrastructure to many fintech and crypto services, including moving funds between JPMorgan accounts and platforms like Robinhood or self-custody wallets used for digital assets such as USDC or USDT. Until now, access to this data has generally been free. But under the proposed changes, the bank could charge fees every time an aggregator pulls a customer’s data. These costs are expected to be passed downstream, first to fintech platforms and eventually to end users. One founder told the press that the cost of accessing JPMorgan’s APIs would exceed the company’s total revenue since its founding over a decade ago. Another industry executive said the new charges would effectively “put everyone out of business” unless they raise prices by up to 1,000%. “ The JPMorgan fees make it impossible to serve Chase customers if you are a small company, ” the fintech executive warned. Letter to the White House explains consumer risks The coalition’s letter from the ten companies argues that JPMorgan’s plan could “de-bank” millions of Americans and deny them access to core financial services in crypto , especially for stablecoins. It could nerf the use of self-custody wallets and real-time digital payments, the groups said. “ Let us be clear: financial data belongs to the American people, not the banks ,” the letter read. “ By challenging open banking, the largest banks stand in direct opposition to your vision of making America the financial innovation capital of the world. ” The trade groups are urging the Trump administration to take immediate action before July 29, when it is expected to submit a legal brief in an ongoing federal case over the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s (CFPB) new open banking rules, specifically Rule 1033 . The regulation, finalized by the CFPB in late 2024, requires financial institutions to provide consumers with free access to their account data and allows them to share it with third-party providers. Still, financial institutions banks like JPMorgan immediately filed lawsuits to block the rule on the same day it was finalized. The CFPB gave in to legal pressure from the banking industry and asked the courts to vacate the rule. According to industry estimates, if JPMorgan’s plan proceeds, Plaid alone could be forced to pay up to $300 million annually in fees, more than 75% of its current revenue. Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi, in a July 12 article written on social platform X, called JPMorgan’s decision to charge fees for data part of a “calculated shift” where banks are monetizing user-generated data and erecting tolls around personal information. “ There is a version of the future where every financial interaction is intermediated by systems that monitor, price, and gate access to your own data, ” Sethi wrote. “ Crypto presents an alternative.

A break below the $116K support is expected, likely pushing the price down toward the $111K region. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin’s price consolidation continues just below its all-time high of $123K, hovering between the $116K and $120K levels. This price behavior signals an equilibrium zone, where buying and selling pressure are currently balanced, a sign that the market awaits a fresh catalyst. Importantly, this range also aligns with the 0.5-0.618 levels of the Trend-Based Fibonacci Extension, adding further technical significance to the current resistance zone. Given the lack of strong bullish momentum, a deeper correction below $116K is likely, with the $111K zone emerging as the next key target. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, BTC appears to be forming a bullish flag — a classic continuation pattern. Despite multiple rebounds from the $116K support, repeated testing suggests growing vulnerability. These reactions have likely created a sell-side liquidity pool just below $116K, increasing the probability of a liquidity sweep followed by a bearish breakout. Should this support level fail, the asset could swiftly decline toward the flag’s lower boundary near $111K. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Binance BTC/USDT Liquidation Heatmap reveals a critical tug-of-war in the current market structure. Bitcoin’s price is currently trapped between two major liquidity clusters, with significant liquidation pools above $120K and below $116K. These zones represent a high concentration of leveraged futures positions, making them prime targets for smart money and market makers seeking liquidity. A price move toward either level could trigger a cascade of liquidations, intensifying volatility and rapidly accelerating price action. As a result, Bitcoin remains range-bound between these two zones until one side is taken out. A breakout above $120K or a breakdown below $116K will likely lead to a sharp, directional move, fueled by stop-losses and forced liquidations.

2025-07-24 12:40:23+00:00,Ethereum Outperformance: Unveiling Why ETH Could Eclipse Bitcoin in Coming Months,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Outperformance: Unveiling Why ETH Could Eclipse Bitcoin in Coming Months The world of digital assets constantly buzzes with predictions, but when a figure like Michael Novogratz speaks, the crypto community listens. The CEO of Galaxy Digital recently made a bold declaration that has sent ripples across the market: he believes Ethereum (ETH) could potentially achieve significant Ethereum outperformance against Bitcoin (BTC) over the next three to six months. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a statement from a seasoned investor with deep insights into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. But what exactly underpins this intriguing forecast, and what could it mean for the future trajectory of these two crypto titans? Why is Michael Novogratz Bullish on Ethereum Outperformance? Michael Novogratz’s conviction stems from a nuanced understanding of Ethereum’s intrinsic value proposition and its ongoing developmental milestones. While Bitcoin is widely revered as ‘digital gold’ – a robust store of value and a hedge against inflation – Ethereum is increasingly seen as the foundational layer for the decentralized internet. Novogratz highlighted that Ethereum’s utility, driven by its vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, positions it for unique growth. He argues that as the digital economy matures, the demand for a programmable blockchain that supports innovation will naturally lead to its appreciation. The continuous evolution of the Ethereum network, particularly its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is a significant factor in his optimistic outlook. This pivotal shift, aimed at improving scalability, security, and energy efficiency, is expected to make Ethereum even more attractive to developers and users alike. Novogratz essentially posits that while Bitcoin holds its ground as a macroeconomic asset, Ethereum is poised to capture the lion’s share of growth in the burgeoning Web3 space, thereby fueling its potential for substantial Ethereum outperformance . What Factors Drive Potential Ethereum Outperformance? The prospect of Ethereum outperformance isn’t merely a speculative forecast; it’s rooted in several tangible developments and inherent strengths of the Ethereum network. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to grasp the dynamics of the crypto market. The Ethereum 2.0 Transition (The Merge and Beyond): The successful completion of ‘The Merge’ marked Ethereum’s shift from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This transition drastically reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption, making it a more environmentally friendly blockchain. Future upgrades, such as the ‘Shanghai’ upgrade enabling staked ETH withdrawals, further enhance the network’s appeal by improving liquidity for stakers. The long-term roadmap includes sharding, which aims to significantly boost transaction throughput and scalability. Staking Yields and Deflationary Pressure: With PoS, users can stake their ETH to secure the network and earn rewards. This creates a yield-bearing asset, attracting institutional and retail investors seeking passive income. Furthermore, a portion of transaction fees is ‘burned’ (removed from circulation), which can lead to a deflationary supply of ETH under certain network conditions, potentially increasing its scarcity and value. Dominance in DeFi and NFTs: Ethereum remains the undisputed leader in the DeFi and NFT sectors. The vast majority of decentralized applications, lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and NFT marketplaces are built on Ethereum. As these sectors continue to grow and attract new users, the demand for ETH, which is used for gas fees and collateral, naturally increases. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: While Ethereum’s mainnet can face congestion and high gas fees, its robust ecosystem includes a thriving landscape of Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon. These L2s process transactions off-chain, bundle them, and then settle them on the main Ethereum blockchain, effectively increasing throughput and reducing costs without compromising security. This symbiotic relationship ensures Ethereum’s continued relevance and scalability. Growing Institutional Interest: Institutional investors are increasingly looking beyond Bitcoin. The programmatic capabilities of Ethereum, its ESG-friendly PoS transition, and its role as the backbone of the decentralized economy are making it an attractive asset for large-scale investments.

BitcoinWorld Ethereum Outperformance: Unveiling Why ETH Could Eclipse Bitcoin in Coming Months The world of digital assets constantly buzzes with predictions, but when a figure like Michael Novogratz speaks, the crypto community listens. The CEO of Galaxy Digital recently made a bold declaration that has sent ripples across the market: he believes Ethereum (ETH) could potentially achieve significant Ethereum outperformance against Bitcoin (BTC) over the next three to six months. This isn’t just a casual remark; it’s a statement from a seasoned investor with deep insights into the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. But what exactly underpins this intriguing forecast, and what could it mean for the future trajectory of these two crypto titans? Why is Michael Novogratz Bullish on Ethereum Outperformance? Michael Novogratz’s conviction stems from a nuanced understanding of Ethereum’s intrinsic value proposition and its ongoing developmental milestones. While Bitcoin is widely revered as ‘digital gold’ – a robust store of value and a hedge against inflation – Ethereum is increasingly seen as the foundational layer for the decentralized internet. Novogratz highlighted that Ethereum’s utility, driven by its vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, positions it for unique growth. He argues that as the digital economy matures, the demand for a programmable blockchain that supports innovation will naturally lead to its appreciation. The continuous evolution of the Ethereum network, particularly its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, is a significant factor in his optimistic outlook. This pivotal shift, aimed at improving scalability, security, and energy efficiency, is expected to make Ethereum even more attractive to developers and users alike. Novogratz essentially posits that while Bitcoin holds its ground as a macroeconomic asset, Ethereum is poised to capture the lion’s share of growth in the burgeoning Web3 space, thereby fueling its potential for substantial Ethereum outperformance . What Factors Drive Potential Ethereum Outperformance? The prospect of Ethereum outperformance isn’t merely a speculative forecast; it’s rooted in several tangible developments and inherent strengths of the Ethereum network. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to grasp the dynamics of the crypto market. The Ethereum 2.0 Transition (The Merge and Beyond): The successful completion of ‘The Merge’ marked Ethereum’s shift from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This transition drastically reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption, making it a more environmentally friendly blockchain. Future upgrades, such as the ‘Shanghai’ upgrade enabling staked ETH withdrawals, further enhance the network’s appeal by improving liquidity for stakers. The long-term roadmap includes sharding, which aims to significantly boost transaction throughput and scalability. Staking Yields and Deflationary Pressure: With PoS, users can stake their ETH to secure the network and earn rewards. This creates a yield-bearing asset, attracting institutional and retail investors seeking passive income. Furthermore, a portion of transaction fees is ‘burned’ (removed from circulation), which can lead to a deflationary supply of ETH under certain network conditions, potentially increasing its scarcity and value. Dominance in DeFi and NFTs: Ethereum remains the undisputed leader in the DeFi and NFT sectors. The vast majority of decentralized applications, lending protocols, decentralized exchanges, and NFT marketplaces are built on Ethereum. As these sectors continue to grow and attract new users, the demand for ETH, which is used for gas fees and collateral, naturally increases. Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: While Ethereum’s mainnet can face congestion and high gas fees, its robust ecosystem includes a thriving landscape of Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon. These L2s process transactions off-chain, bundle them, and then settle them on the main Ethereum blockchain, effectively increasing throughput and reducing costs without compromising security. This symbiotic relationship ensures Ethereum’s continued relevance and scalability. Growing Institutional Interest: Institutional investors are increasingly looking beyond Bitcoin. The programmatic capabilities of Ethereum, its ESG-friendly PoS transition, and its role as the backbone of the decentralized economy are making it an attractive asset for large-scale investments. Products like ETH ETFs and institutional staking services are emerging, signaling growing mainstream acceptance.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding these macro shifts is paramount. The ECB’s decision to keep ECB interest rates unchanged marks a significant pause after a series of aggressive adjustments, prompting crucial questions about the Eurozone’s economic trajectory and its potential influence on digital assets. What Did the European Central Bank Decide on Interest Rates? According to JinSe Finance, the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to maintain its key interest rates at their current levels. This move follows an unprecedented period of seven consecutive rate cuts, signaling a shift in the central bank’s monetary policy stance. Specifically, the deposit rate, which is the interest rate banks receive for depositing money with the ECB overnight, remains steady at 2%. This rate is a benchmark for lending and borrowing within the Eurozone’s financial system. Beyond the deposit rate, the ECB also confirmed that its other primary rates would remain unchanged: Main Refinancing Rate: This rate, at which commercial banks can borrow money from the ECB for one week, stays at 2.15%. It’s a key indicator of the cost of money in the economy. Marginal Lending Rate: The rate at which banks can borrow from the ECB overnight against eligible collateral remains at 2.40%. This serves as an upper bound for the overnight market interest rate. This collective decision to hold ECB interest rates steady reflects a period of assessment for the central bank, as it navigates complex economic data and geopolitical uncertainties. The stability in these rates suggests the ECB believes its previous actions have had the desired effect, or that new data points warrant a period of observation before further adjustments. Why Did the ECB Pause on Interest Rate Adjustments? The decision by the ECB to halt its aggressive cycle of rate cuts and keep ECB interest rates stable is a complex one, likely influenced by a confluence of economic indicators and strategic considerations. After seven consecutive cuts aimed at stimulating economic growth and combating deflationary pressures, the central bank is now in a different phase. Several factors could explain this pivotal pause: Inflationary Pressures: While overall inflation might have decreased, certain components, particularly core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices), might still be stubbornly high or showing signs of persistence. The ECB needs to ensure that inflation is firmly on track to meet its target of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. Economic Data Evaluation: The ECB likely needs more time to fully assess the impact of its previous rate cuts on the Eurozone economy. Lag effects mean that monetary policy changes don’t immediately manifest in economic activity. Waiting allows for a clearer picture of GDP growth, employment figures, and consumer spending. Global Economic Headwinds: Uncertainties in the global economy, including supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and the performance of major trading partners, could also play a role. A pause allows the ECB to observe how these external factors evolve before committing to a new policy direction for ECB interest rates . Financial Stability Concerns: Rapid and continuous rate cuts, while stimulating, can also introduce risks to financial stability, such as asset bubbles or excessive risk-taking by banks. A pause can help mitigate these potential downsides and ensure a more stable financial environment. This period of stability in ECB interest rates can be seen as a strategic breath, allowing policymakers to gather more comprehensive data and recalibrate their approach for future decisions. How Do Unchanged ECB Interest Rates Impact the Eurozone Economy? The decision to keep ECB interest rates unchanged has multifaceted implications for the Eurozone economy, affecting everything from borrowing costs for consumers and businesses to the overall economic outlook. Understanding these impacts is key to grasping the broader financial landscape. Here’s how stable ECB interest rates might play out: Borrowing Costs: For consumers, unchanged rates mean that the cost of mortgages, car loans, and personal loans will likely remain stable. This provides a degree of predictability for household budgets, neither encouraging a spending spree through cheaper credit nor tightening belts due to rising costs. Businesses will also find borrowing costs for investment and expansion remain consistent, which can support ongoing projects but might not spur new, significant ventures if economic uncertainty persists.

This isn’t just another small purchase; it’s a significant bolstering of their existing cryptocurrency reserves, sending a clear signal about the increasing confidence traditional corporations are placing in Bitcoin. For anyone tracking the evolution of corporate treasuries and the mainstream adoption of digital assets, this development from Semler Scientific is nothing short of pivotal. Semler Scientific Bitcoin: What Just Happened? In a move that underscores its deepening commitment to digital assets, Semler Scientific announced the acquisition of an additional 175 BTC. This latest purchase brings their total Bitcoin holdings to a remarkable 5,021 BTC. This update, initially highlighted by the crypto community via @btcNLNico on X, quickly resonated across financial news outlets, reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin’s growing appeal as a treasury reserve asset. But why is a medical technology company making such a significant bet on Bitcoin? Strategic Vision: Semler Scientific views Bitcoin as a compelling investment due to its characteristics as a store of value and an inflation hedge. Long-Term Growth: The company believes in Bitcoin’s potential for long-term capital appreciation, positioning it as a key component of their overall financial strategy. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding Bitcoin helps diversify their corporate treasury beyond traditional assets, potentially offering protection against economic uncertainties. Why Are Companies Like Semler Scientific Bitcoin Enthusiasts? The decision by Semler Scientific to substantially increase its Semler Scientific Bitcoin holdings is part of a broader trend among publicly traded companies. This isn’t a speculative gamble for many; it’s a calculated financial strategy driven by several compelling factors: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive alternative to fiat currencies, which can lose purchasing power over time. Digital Gold Narrative: Increasingly, Bitcoin is being seen as “digital gold” – a scarce, decentralized asset that can serve as a reliable store of value, especially during times of economic volatility. Diversification of Corporate Treasuries: Traditional corporate treasuries often rely heavily on cash, short-term government bonds, and other low-yield assets. Bitcoin offers a way to diversify and potentially enhance returns in a low-interest-rate environment. Forward-Thinking Investment: Companies that embrace Bitcoin are often perceived as innovative and forward-thinking, which can appeal to a new generation of investors and customers. This proactive stance can also position them favorably for the evolving digital economy. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, making it an attractive asset for companies looking to grow their balance sheets. The Growing Trend of Semler Scientific Bitcoin Acquisitions: A Broader Look While Semler Scientific’s latest acquisition is noteworthy, they are certainly not alone in this journey. The pioneer in this space, MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, has famously amassed over 226,314 BTC, setting a precedent for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Other notable companies, from Tesla to Block Inc. (formerly Square), have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, albeit with varying strategies and scales. This growing cohort of institutional investors signals a fundamental shift in how corporations view digital assets. It moves Bitcoin from the realm of niche speculative investment to a legitimate treasury asset. The decision by a medical technology company like Semler Scientific, which operates in a traditionally conservative sector, further legitimizes Bitcoin’s role in diverse corporate portfolios.

2025-07-24 13:00:37+00:00,Ethereum Is Becoming Crypto’s Reserve Asset: New Research,"A new research from analytics firm Artemis argues that Ether is undergoing the same reputational pivot Bitcoin experienced in the mid-2010s, but on fundamentally different terms. “Evaluating ETH purely through the lens of cash flows or protocol fees is a category error,” writes lead author Kevin Li. “It is better understood as a scarce yet productive, programmable reserve asset whose value accrues through its role in securing, settling and powering an increasingly institutionalized on-chain economy.” Ethereum’s Path To Reserve Asset Status Li begins by tackling the long-running critique that Ethereum’s flexible monetary policy disqualifies it as a store of value. He models a worst-case scenario in which every ETH in existence is staked and issuance hits its theoretical ceiling. Even then, annual inflation tops out at roughly 1.52 percent in 2025 and decays to 0.89 percent by 2125—well below the US dollar’s 6.36 percent average M2 expansion since 1998 and even beneath gold’s long-run annual supply growth. The paper argues that the combination of sublinear issuance and the EIP-1559 burn has already pushed net inflation near—or periodically below—zero, giving ETH a supply profile that “rivals gold while retaining the programmability of software.” Macro conditions provide the backdrop for the thesis. Artemis notes that decades of monetary expansion have eroded trust in fiat and driven investors toward alternative stores of value. The US consumer-price index has averaged 2.53 percent a year since 1998, but the money supply has grown more than twice as fast, a gap the report claims “may account for a significant share of nominal equity-market gains.” Ethereum’s adaptive monetary policy, Li contends, offers a disciplined alternative without sacrificing the network’s ability to pay validators. Institutional adoption is the second pillar of the argument. Over the past 12 months JPMorgan, BlackRock and Robinhood have each chosen Ethereum rails—either the base layer or an affiliated roll-up—for tokenized deposits, money-market funds and equity trading prototypes. The report cites BlackRock’s BUIDL fund and JPMorgan’s forthcoming JPMD deposit token as proof that blue-chip institutions are no longer experimenting on testnets but building products that will settle value at scale. “As traditional finance migrates on-chain, the need to hold and stake ETH becomes structural rather than discretionary,” Li writes. That dynamic is visible in on-chain data. Artemis calculates that the supply of stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets on Ethereum reached a record $123 billion in June, while the amount of ETH locked in validators climbed to 35.5 million. The year-on-year correlation between the value of on-chain assets and staked ETH exceeds 88 percent across every major category the firm tracks, reinforcing the idea that demand for security and settlement drives demand for the native token. Regulation, long the wild card for any staking-based value proposition, has started to tilt in Ethereum’s favor. On May 29 the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance issued guidance stating that protocol-level staking, delegated staking and certain custodial staking arrangements do not in themselves constitute securities offerings. While the ruling left room for fact-specific enforcement, it cleared the way for spot-ETH ETF filers to include staking provisions in their S-1 amendments. Several prospective issuers have since done exactly that, promising investors both passive exposure to ETH and a share of consensus rewards. Competition For Bitcoin? The Artemis report also highlights an emerging “treasury-asset wave” reminiscent of MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy in 2020. Sharplink Gaming disclosed in late May that it would begin allocating corporate cash to Ether, a move followed by a cluster of smaller US and Asian public companies. Together they now hold more than 730,000 ETH, or roughly $2.6 billion at current prices. The accumulation has coincided with a period of ETH outperformance versus BTC—an unusual trend in the current cycle, which has otherwise been dominated by Bitcoin narratives such as halving supply shocks and prospective US reserve holdings. Critics who argue that Layer 2 networks cannibalize Ethereum’s fee base “miss the point,” Li says. By off-loading execution while anchoring settlement and data availability to the base layer, roll-ups expand Ethereum’s total addressable market without eroding its security budget. Li compares the arrangement to the Federal Reserve System: “Regional banks handle day-to-day traffic, but ultimate settlement rests with the central bank.” In that analogy ETH is the reserve asset that guarantees finality. The paper concedes that other high-throughput Layer 1s, particularly Solana, have siphoned off “meme-coin velocity” and micro-transaction volume. Solana processed more transactions than Ethereum in five of the past six quarters.

In 2028, the price of Cartesi is predicted to reach a maximum level of $0.3386. Cartesi is expected to cross a price level of $1.07 in 2031. Developers can now write code for dApps and create complex and straightforward smart contracts using Linux architecture on Cartesi. This feature inducts conventional programmers into the blockchain ecosystem to code smart contracts using Ruby, Python, REST, MongoDB, Eigen, MySQL, Nginx, Libsnark, and Linux. Cartesi’s real-world use cases make it appealing to potential investors. Let’s learn more about the Cartesi (CTSI) project, its uniqueness, its technical analysis, historical data, and market price predictions.

The bearish structure holds both the daily and 4-hour charts, showing lower highs and lower lows, confirming ongoing bearish momentum. $0.07000 Is the key support a drop below $0.07000 may trigger further decline toward $0.06500, while holding above it could pause the downtrend. On July 24th 2025, Cartesi (CTSI) is trading at $0.07236, marking a daily decline of 8.11%. The bearish movement has pushed the token away from its 24-hour high of $0.07964, establishing a clear resistance level there. On the lower side, CTSI found support at $0.06848, which briefly held during today’s downward momentum. CTSI’s current price action reflects cautious investor sentiment, reinforced by broader market consolidation and selling pressure across altcoins. Cartesi 1-day price chart: CTSI breaks down as sellers reject higher levels The daily chart outlines a pronounced descending trend as CTSI breaks beneath its recent consolidation range. Price action from the previous day reveals a failed breakout attempt above $0.07964, met with aggressive sell-offs that drove the asset to intra-day lows around $0.06848. The 8.11% daily drop confirms a momentum shift, and the lack of bullish follow-through from the mid-day bounce underlines weak buyer interest. The recovery to the $0.072 zone may serve as a lower high if the price continues respecting downward resistance channels. CTSIUSDT Chart By TradingView Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the daily is approaching oversold territory but still holds above the 30 mark, indicating that further downside could materialize before buyers re-enter with volume. The price remains below key moving averages, including the 50-day EMA, reinforcing bearish sentiment. Any upward reaction may face stiff resistance at $0.075 and $0.07964, the latter being the ceiling of the current trend. If CTSI closes below the $0.07000 mark in the next session, downside continuation toward $0.06500 becomes increasingly probable. Cartesi 4-hour price chart: CTSI short-term trend confirms lower highs and weak momentum The 4-hour chart shows consistent lower highs and lower lows, suggesting trend continuation. Price action remains confined below $0.074, with each bounce encountering immediate rejection. CTSIUSDT Chart By TradingView Momentum indicators reflect limited bullish strength, with volume declining on each recovery attempt.

BitMine Immersion Technologies, a prominent player in the Bitcoin (BTC) mining space, has revealed an astonishing development: their Ethereum reserves have surged past the monumental $2 billion mark. This isn’t just a headline; it’s a clear signal of strategic diversification and a testament to the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem. For a company primarily known for its BTC operations, accumulating such a significant cache of ETH sparks immediate questions and profound implications for the broader crypto market. What are BitMine’s Ethereum Reserves and Why Do They Matter? On July 23, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, confirmed via a PR Newswire press release that its holdings of Ethereum (ETH) had reached an impressive 566,776 ETH. At current market valuations, this translates to over $2 billion in Ethereum reserves . This revelation is particularly significant because BitMine is fundamentally a Bitcoin mining enterprise. Traditionally, Bitcoin miners convert their mined BTC into fiat or hold it as their primary treasury asset. BitMine’s substantial ETH accumulation represents a deviation from this norm, highlighting a proactive strategy to broaden its digital asset portfolio. Why does this matter so much? Consider these points: Scale of Investment: $2 billion is not a trivial sum. It signifies a major capital allocation, reflecting deep conviction in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition. Diversification Play: For a Bitcoin-centric company, holding a significant amount of ETH acts as a diversification strategy, potentially mitigating risks associated with sole reliance on Bitcoin’s price movements. Market Signal: This move sends a strong message to the institutional world and the broader crypto community about Ethereum’s increasing acceptance as a core digital asset, not just a speculative altcoin. To put the value into perspective, here’s a snapshot of the reported holdings: Asset Quantity (as of July 23) Approximate USD Value (at time of announcement) Ethereum (ETH) 566,776 ETH Over $2 Billion The Strategic Shift: Why is a Bitcoin Miner Accumulating Ethereum Reserves? This bold move by BitMine raises a crucial question: What drives a Bitcoin mining company to amass such substantial Ethereum reserves ? The answer likely lies in a multi-faceted strategic approach that extends beyond traditional mining operations. Here are some key motivations: Portfolio Diversification: Just like traditional investment portfolios, crypto portfolios benefit from diversification. While Bitcoin is often seen as “digital gold,” Ethereum powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, NFTs, and more. Holding ETH allows BitMine to gain exposure to different growth vectors within the crypto space. Yield Opportunities (Staking): With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) via the Merge, holding ETH opens up opportunities for staking rewards. Companies can stake their ETH to support the network and earn passive income, turning a static asset into a productive one. This could be a significant long-term revenue stream for BitMine. Hedging Against Volatility: While both BTC and ETH are volatile, their price movements are not always perfectly correlated. Holding both assets can act as a hedge, potentially smoothing out overall portfolio performance during market fluctuations. Belief in Ethereum’s Ecosystem: BitMine’s decision signals a strong belief in the long-term viability and growth potential of the Ethereum network and its associated Web3 economy. As more applications and services are built on Ethereum, the underlying asset’s value could appreciate significantly. Institutional Adoption Trend: We’ve seen a growing trend of institutional players exploring Ethereum beyond just Bitcoin. BitMine might be positioning itself to be at the forefront of this shift, appealing to a broader range of institutional investors who are increasingly interested in the entire digital asset landscape. This strategic pivot isn’t unique to BitMine, though their scale is notable. Other companies and even some Bitcoin miners have begun to explore holding other digital assets, but BitMine’s public declaration and the sheer volume of their Ethereum reserves set a precedent. Benefits of Accumulating Substantial Ethereum Reserves for Companies Beyond the immediate financial figures, a company holding significant Ethereum reserves can unlock several strategic advantages. This move isn’t just about speculation; it’s about strengthening the balance sheet and positioning for future growth in the digital economy.

2025-07-24 13:25:09+00:00,Solana Core Developers Present a New Proposal to Increase Network Transaction Capacity! Here Are the Details,"Solana core developers have published a new development proposal, SIMD-0286, with the aim of increasing the processing capacity of the network. Solana Developers Plan to Increase Block Computation Limit by 66% to Increase Network Capacity This proposal aims to increase the compute unit limit that can be processed every 400 millisecond blocks on the Solana blockchain from 60 million CUs to 100 million CUs, representing a 66% capacity increase. According to the proposal published on the Solana Foundation''s GitHub page, this update aims to increase the network''s throughput by enabling higher transaction volume, particularly for decentralized finance (DeFi) users and developers. Block limits define the maximum computational load that validators can process within each block. Increasing this limit will allow applications that require high computational power, particularly orderbook-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and Maximum Extractable Value (MEV) auctions, to operate without encountering “computation budget exceeded” errors. However, this will also require more robust processing capacity from validators. The Solana network increased its block limit to 60 million CUs with SIMD-0256 on July 23rd. This change allowed the network to process approximately 1,700 transactions per second during daylight hours. However, with the rise of applications like re-staking protocols, NFT minting, and DePIN projects operating on the network, developers began demanding more block space. The SIMD-0286 proposal is currently being discussed and tested within the community. The update is expected to be deployed with a future software release and automatically activate in a future epoch once a majority of network validators have accepted the upgrade. This development comes at a time when rival blockchains are rolling out their own upgrades. Ethereum, with its Pectra hardfork, has enhanced its use of ephemeral data blobs for rollups, introduced in the Dencun update. The Bitcoin community is working on a new opcode called OP_CAT, which could improve smart contract capabilities and scripting, paving the way for more programmable transactions on the network. This block capacity increase proposed by Solana is considered a critical step in the intensely competitive blockchain infrastructure development race. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-24 13:25:20+00:00,SEC decision expected by October as Fidelity pushes for in-kind BTC ETF redemptions,"Fidelity has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to enable in-kind redemption for FBTC, its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bloomberg Intelligence ETF research analyst James Seyffart confirmed the application on X. Seyffart’s confirmation came as a rebuttal to the rumors circulating that FBTC now allows in-kind redemption. According to the commentator, the SEC has not allowed this yet, even though the regulator is expected to allow it eventually. He said : “Seeing a lot of accounts reporting that Fidelity is now able to do in-kind creation/redemption with their Bitcoin ETF. The SEC hasn’t yet allowed this… We do expect the SEC to approve this. But they haven’t yet.” Beyond Fidelity , several other issuers have filed amendments to enable this type of redemption for their spot crypto ETF products. These include Ark 21Shares, Galaxy, WisdomTree, VanEck, and Invesco Galaxy. Interestingly, it is not just Bitcoin ETFs trying to amend for in-kind redemptions. ETH spot ETFs are also filing for amendments, and the CBOE exchange recently filed for five ETFs listed on it. If approved, in-kind redemption would allow authorized participants to create and redeem the crypto ETF shares directly in Bitcoin instead of first converting the digital assets to cash. Commentators such as Seyffart say this will improve efficiency for spot and futures crypto ETFs and allow them to trade similarly to traditional ETFs. It is also expected to reduce costs by helping participants avoid taxes associated with transactions. Although the change, if approved, will only affect institutional participants in those ETFs rather than the retail traders, the idea of in-kind redemption remains something the crypto community is watching out for. This is likely why rumors of approval for FBTC quickly circulated on X. Fidelity’s in-kind redemption approval is likely to come in October While rumors of approvals have been debunked, Seyffart noted that it is likely to come by October. According to him, this is because the first official deadline for the SEC to decide on the pending in-kind amendments is around October 10. He said: “Official deadline for any sort of In-kind create/redeem is in October (~Oct 10). Our base case is that they will all be approved by October.” However, he acknowledged that the recent filing of amendments by the CBOE is a positive sign because it shows that work is going on at the SEC to finalize this decision, with firms also fine-tuning their applications. Interestingly, this is not the only crypto ETF decision before the SEC. The regulator also has a decision to make on the hundreds of spot crypto ETFs applications before it, and has yet to lift the stay orders on the two multi-assets funds approved for their conversion to ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs see three days of outflows Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs have now seen three days of consecutive outflows this week in what appears to be a continuation of sell-offs happening to the underlying asset since it reached the peak above $123,000. According to data from Farside Investors , the products have seen a combined outflow of $285.2 million in those three days, with Ark 21Shares ARKB responsible for most of the outflows. Interestingly, BlackRock IBIT has seen no outflow during this time; instead, it had two days of zero flows and recorded $142.6 million in inflows on Wednesday. Despite the broader outflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs, analysts believe institutional investors remain behind the rally. CryptoQuant verified analyst Burak Kesmeci noted that on-chain data and Google Trends show that accumulation has been from big players while retail has been selling since early 2023. Bitcoin’s larger investors are driving price rally as retail holdings decline. Source: CryptoQuant He said: “Searches for ‘Bitcoin’ are not at their lowest in the past 5 years, but they are still quite muted. So there is no retail FOMO or hype at this point. The crowd has not awakened yet. This cycle looks nothing like the madness of 2021.” With retail yet to get involved and BTC already scaling multiple peaks, Kesmeci believes that Bitcoin might still have more room to go up. However, he noted that retail entry could mark a market top.

This cycle looks nothing like the madness of 2021.” With retail yet to get involved and BTC already scaling multiple peaks, Kesmeci believes that Bitcoin might still have more room to go up.

2025-07-24 13:27:52+00:00,Retail or Whales? CryptoQuant Analyzes the Forces Behind Bitcoin’s Latest Rally,"On-chain data analyzed by the market intelligence firm CryptoQuant has revealed that retail Bitcoin players are almost nowhere to be found amid the latest rally. Larger investors, however, are driving the surge. According to the report , this cycle is different from previous ones because retail investors are selling, while large players are buying. Retail Investors Are Absent In past cycles, retail players have consistently dominated the final phases of bitcoin’s (BTC) bull run. The crypto market often witnessed retail investor frenzy, hype, and mass euphoria. However, that is not the case this time, as there is different behaviour among Bitcoin investor cohorts. Since early 2023, retail BTC investors have been selling their holdings. Data charts show that the holdings of this investor cohort have consistently declined since then. Currently, retail accumulation has turned significantly negative. Conversely, large investors began an accumulation trend in early 2024. This group of investors is led by institutions, high-volume wallets, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These market participants have been aggressively accumulating BTC, signaling long-term confidence in the asset. As BTC climbed to $123,000, retail investors continued selling, while larger players persisted in their accumulation. The asset is now consolidating below $120,000, and large investors are still in the driver’s seat, sustaining the positive uptrend. Bitcoin Searches Remain Muted Data from Google Trends further substantiates CryptoQuant’s analysis. Searches for “Bitcoin,” while not at the lowest in five years, are still muted. Past reports have shown that a rise in retail interest often follows an increase in bitcoin’s price. The market experienced this trend in late 2020 and early 2021, and it continued in November 2024. The muted retail interest in Bitcoin suggests that the crowd has not yet awakened. CryptoQuant says there is no retail fear of missing out (FOMO) or social media overflowing currently. “This cycle looks nothing like the madness of 2021…Quiet and smart money is currently on stage — and most people are still watching from the sidelines,” the analytics firm stated. In conclusion, the absence of retail investors in this phase of the cycle suggests that BTC still has room for growth. However, an increase in retail participation may signal the end of the bull run.

2025-07-24 13:30:00+00:00,Suspects in Crypto Torture Case Granted Bail,"Prosecutors allege the victim was held for weeks, physically abused, and threatened with death unless he surrendered access to his Bitcoin. The suspects deny the charges, and claim the incident was a consensual hazing. Authorities discovered weapons, drugs, and surveillance equipment at the scene, and both men are now under strict bail conditions ahead of their next court date on Oct. 15. Kidnapping Suspects Freed on $1 Million Bail Two men accused of abducting and torturing an Italian crypto trader in Manhattan have been granted bail by a New York judge. John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, each received a $1 million bail on Wednesday and have pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping, assault, and coercion. The charges stem from a disturbing incident that took place in early May when a 28-year-old Italian crypto trader visiting New York was allegedly taken hostage upon his arrival. Prosecutors say the man was held captive for weeks inside a Manhattan townhouse, during which time he was beaten, shocked with wires, pistol-whipped, and threatened with death if he did not surrender access to his Bitcoin holdings. According to the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, the captors even threatened to kill the victim’s family, and investigators recovered photos showing a gun pointed at his head. The victim eventually escaped in late May by convincing one of the suspects to let him use a laptop under the pretense of retrieving his crypto password. Once left alone, he fled and sought help from a nearby traffic officer. He was later hospitalized with injuries consistent with his claims of prolonged abuse. (Source: ABC News ) Woeltz is a crypto investor from Kentucky, and was arrested at the scene. Duplessie, a Miami resident, surrendered to authorities days later. A search of the townhouse revealed a large stash of weapons, drugs, surveillance gear, and body armor, along with signs of a premeditated attack. William Duplessie As a condition of their bail, both men must wear electronic ankle monitors, surrender their passports, and report for security inspections every 72 hours.

As Bitcoin hovered near $120,000 this week, OKX users were quick to take profits , with their realized deposit price jumping to $97,180. This suggests traders are actively selling into the rally. In contrast, Binance users appear to be holding firm . Their Bitcoin deposit price stayed steady around $45,070, indicating that many are sticking close to their original entry points instead of cashing out. This is a big shift from earlier rallies, where Binance whales were quicker to sell. The same pattern shows up with Ethereum. While ETH trades near $3,570, OKX’s realized deposit price hit $3,100 , suggesting fast-moving profit-taking. On Binance, the price climbed more slowly to $2,920, hinting at a longer-term outlook from users. Analysts say this holding behavior from Binance users could mean two things: growing confidence in further upside—or simply no urgency to exit the market. Swissblock’s latest report supports this view, describing Bitcoin’s current structure as bullish, even though momentum has temporarily slowed.

2025-07-24 13:32:27+00:00,Jim Cramer reveals the 2 cryptos he’s buying as U.S. debt hits $37 trillion,"Jim Cramer , the outspoken CNBC host and former hedge fund manager , has once again voiced his support for owning Bitcoin ( BTC ), and this time, he’s tying it to concerns about America’s surging national debt. Speaking during a CNBC segment on Wednesday, Cramer revealed that he has been buying Bitcoin as a hedge against the United States’ ballooning debt, which has now reached $37.8 trillion. When asked whether Bitcoin could hold up during a financial crisis, Cramer responded affirmatively, describing it as “just a nice hedge for what I’m afraid.” While acknowledging his hope that the U.S. can “grow its way out” of the debt crisis, Cramer emphasized that his crypto buying is rooted in concern for his children’s future. “I buy it a lot because I’m very worried,” Cramer said. “Own some as a hedge against the $37–$38 trillion. They want to own it for their kids, and you know who else feels that way? Me. I don’t want that debt. I’m worried about my kids. Why don’t you buy some Bitcoin or Ethereum?” Cramer, known for his animated style and frequent bold market calls, has been both a vocal critic and supporter of cryptocurrencies at various times over the years. His latest comments suggest that despite his fluctuating stance, he views Bitcoin and Ethereum as strategic holdings in a world of mounting fiscal risks, but he equally could just be following the trends of large institutional buys from the likes of BlackRock.

2025-07-24 13:34:01+00:00,Pengu Price Prediction: Pudgy Penguins Token Blasts 433% – Next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu?,"Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) has surged 433% over the past 30 days, fueled by Canary Capital’s push to launch an ETF tied to the meme coin. The move has supercharged a bullish PENGU price prediction and injected fresh momentum into Solana-based meme assets. Apart from PENGU, Bonk (BONK), the largest Solana-based meme coin by market cap, has managed to maintain its lead as its price surged by 154% during this same period following the launch of LetsBonk. A spike in interest for Pudgy Penguins’ non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has resulted in a jump in their floor price . Data shows that Pudgy Penguins are now sold at 16 ETH (around $58,320 each). This implies a 100% jump in just 15 days. Most predictions for the token across social media are currently bullish. However, they also expect a mild retreat that would provide a more decent entry for late buyers. Would love to see $PENGU drive at some lows. Any downside is going to be temporary so just represents opportunity to add more size. Some obvious target points around here, just going to depend how generous the market will be. pic.twitter.com/Et2ivN4vPQ — Cold Blooded Shiller (@ColdBloodShill) July 24, 2025 Trader Cold Blooded Shiller, whose X account is followed by nearly 339,000 users, is positioning to buy if the price drops to $0.035 as positive momentum should resume after that. PENGU Price Prediction: PENGU Could Rise to $0.080 If Its Trend Line Support Holds The daily chart shows PENGU’s vertical ascent and how the token has already formed a clearly defined uptrend that could act as both support and resistance over the next few days. Based on that trajectory, the key area of support to watch for PENGU would be the $0.037 level, at which point the price should bounce off its trend line support and move toward $0.06, meaning a 63% upside potential in the near term. Trading volumes have been quite high for PENGU in the past few days and currently account for 75% of the token’s circulating supply. This means that traders are still quite interested in the asset despite today’s 10% retreat. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) still sits at 74, meaning that the uptrend’s strength remains high. Even if the trend line support is broken, the 9-day and 21-day exponential moving average (EMA) should act as the last line of defense for bulls. In the meantime, a new era for Bitcoin’s DeFi could be about to begin with the launch of Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER). Solana meme coins like PENGU may continue to thrive as billions of dollars locked up in BTC could now flow to this blockchain via the HYPER bridge. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Raises Nearly $4.5M to Unlock the Untapped Potential of BTC Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is a high-performance layer-two chain designed to bridge the Bitcoin and Solana networks. It is paving the way for a new era of BTCFi, a growing movement to bring DeFi utility and programmability to the Bitcoin ecosystem. BTC holders won’t have to leave the Bitcoin network anymore to earn yield, stake, and lend their assets. They can send their BTC to a canonical address designated for the Hyper Bridge where these tokens will be stored safely. Upon receiving these assets, the corresponding amount will be minted on the Bitcoin Hyper L2 to access DeFi platforms. The Solana blockchain makes all of this possible with lightning-fast speed and low transaction costs. As top wallets and exchanges embrace Bitcoin Hyper, the demand for $HYPER should explode. To buy this token early at its discounted presale price, simply head to the Bitcoin Hyper website and connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ).

The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and a major shift is underway towards more active and rewarding investment strategies. Leading this charge is Spirit Blockchain Capital, a digital asset manager that has just announced a game-changing pivot with its new “Spirit Blockchain 2.0” strategy. This isn’t just another update; it’s a fundamental transformation designed to unlock unprecedented returns through sophisticated crypto yield generation . What is Spirit Blockchain’s Revolutionary 2.0 Strategy? For a long time, many crypto investors, and even some institutional players, have approached digital assets with a more passive “buy and hold” mentality. While this can work, it often leaves significant opportunities on the table. Spirit Blockchain Capital recognized this and, according to a GlobeNewswire press release, decided it was time for a dramatic shift. Spirit Blockchain 2.0 marks a decisive move away from simply holding crypto. Instead, the company is transforming into an active, yield-generating platform. Think of it as moving from merely owning a property to actively developing it to produce rental income or capital gains. This strategic overhaul is designed to maximize returns from their digital asset portfolio by engaging in various sophisticated financial activities within the blockchain ecosystem. The core objective is to generate consistent and substantial returns for its stakeholders by harnessing the power of crypto yield generation mechanisms. How Does Spirit Blockchain Capital Actively Generate Crypto Yield? The magic of Spirit Blockchain’s 2.0 strategy lies in its multi-pronged approach to yield generation. They aren’t putting all their eggs in one basket. Instead, they’re diversifying their methods across several proven and emerging strategies in the digital asset space. This comprehensive approach is key to their robust crypto yield generation model. Here’s a closer look at the primary avenues they’re exploring: Staking: Imagine earning rewards just for holding your cryptocurrency! That’s essentially what staking is. In proof-of-stake blockchain networks (like Ethereum 2.0, Solana, and others), participants can “stake” their crypto to support the network’s operations and security. In return, they receive newly minted coins or transaction fees as rewards. Spirit Blockchain will strategically stake portions of its BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and XRP holdings, contributing to network security while earning passive income. Lending: Just like traditional finance, the crypto world has its own lending markets. Spirit Blockchain plans to lend out its digital assets to borrowers, who pay interest for the use of those funds. This can happen on centralized platforms or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Lending provides a predictable stream of income, making it a reliable component of their crypto yield generation strategy. Structured Products: This is where things get a bit more sophisticated. Structured products in crypto are customized financial instruments that combine various assets or derivatives to achieve specific risk-reward profiles. These can involve options, futures, or other complex strategies designed to generate enhanced returns, often with a defined payout structure. Spirit Blockchain will leverage its expertise to identify and invest in these products, aiming for optimized returns that wouldn’t be possible through simple spot trading. Which Digital Assets Are Key to Spirit Blockchain’s Success? Spirit Blockchain’s strategy isn’t just about how they generate yield, but also which assets they choose to work with. Their initial focus on a select group of high-profile cryptocurrencies demonstrates a calculated approach to maximizing their crypto yield generation potential while managing risk. The company explicitly named the following digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC): The king of crypto, offering unparalleled liquidity and often used as a store of value. While direct staking isn’t native to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work, it can be utilized in lending and structured products. Ethereum (ETH): The backbone of DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake makes it a prime candidate for direct staking, offering significant yield opportunities. Solana (SOL): A high-performance blockchain known for its speed and scalability, SOL is a popular asset for staking and participation in its vibrant DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin (DOGE): While often seen as a meme coin, DOGE has a large community and can be utilized in lending protocols, especially given its high liquidity. XRP: Known for its focus on cross-border payments, XRP can also be part of lending and structured product strategies within the digital asset market. By focusing on these established and liquid assets, Spirit Blockchain aims to ensure robust participation",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-yield-generation-spirit/,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH|BTC,Crypto News|Blockchain Investments|Crypto Yield Generation|Digital Assets|Staking|Tokenization,BTC,"Crypto Yield Generation: Spirit Blockchain’s Revolutionary 2.0 Strategy Unlocks Unprecedented Returns.

Here’s a closer look at the primary avenues they’re exploring: Staking: Imagine earning rewards just for holding your cryptocurrency! That’s essentially what staking is. In proof-of-stake blockchain networks (like Ethereum 2.0, Solana, and others), participants can “stake” their crypto to support the network’s operations and security. In return, they receive newly minted coins or transaction fees as rewards. Spirit Blockchain will strategically stake portions of its BTC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and XRP holdings, contributing to network security while earning passive income. Lending: Just like traditional finance, the crypto world has its own lending markets. Spirit Blockchain plans to lend out its digital assets to borrowers, who pay interest for the use of those funds. This can happen on centralized platforms or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Lending provides a predictable stream of income, making it a reliable component of their crypto yield generation strategy. Structured Products: This is where things get a bit more sophisticated. Structured products in crypto are customized financial instruments that combine various assets or derivatives to achieve specific risk-reward profiles. These can involve options, futures, or other complex strategies designed to generate enhanced returns, often with a defined payout structure. Spirit Blockchain will leverage its expertise to identify and invest in these products, aiming for optimized returns that wouldn’t be possible through simple spot trading. Which Digital Assets Are Key to Spirit Blockchain’s Success? Spirit Blockchain’s strategy isn’t just about how they generate yield, but also which assets they choose to work with. Their initial focus on a select group of high-profile cryptocurrencies demonstrates a calculated approach to maximizing their crypto yield generation potential while managing risk. The company explicitly named the following digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC): The king of crypto, offering unparalleled liquidity and often used as a store of value. While direct staking isn’t native to Bitcoin’s proof-of-work, it can be utilized in lending and structured products. Ethereum (ETH): The backbone of DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake makes it a prime candidate for direct staking, offering significant yield opportunities. Solana (SOL): A high-performance blockchain known for its speed and scalability, SOL is a popular asset for staking and participation in its vibrant DeFi ecosystem. Dogecoin (DOGE): While often seen as a meme coin, DOGE has a large community and can be utilized in lending protocols, especially given its high liquidity. XRP: Known for its focus on cross-border payments, XRP can also be part of lending and structured product strategies within the digital asset market. By focusing on these established and liquid assets, Spirit Blockchain aims to ensure robust participation"

2025-07-24 13:53:15+00:00,Hong Kong to pursue criminal charges against unlicensed stablecoin activity from August,"From August 1, Hong Kong’s government will enforce a new crypto law that criminalizes the promotion and offering of unlicensed fiat-referenced stablecoins (FRS) to the public. The legislation was introduced through the Stablecoins Ordinance passed by Hong Kong’s Legislative Council on May 21. According to a public notice published on Wednesday, the new law grants the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) powers to penalize crypto companies that do not comply. Violations will lead to fines of up to HK$50,000 (approximately US$6,300) and a maximum prison term of six months for individuals or entities found promoting or offering unlicensed stablecoins. Promotion without a license is a crime, HKMA says Under the new legislation, any individual or company that promotes, offers, or facilitates the transaction of a stablecoin referencing a fiat currency must be licensed by the HKMA. The law defines the digital assets as “specified stablecoins” and subjects them to oversight under Part 2 of the ordinance. Section 9 of the Stablecoins Ordinance makes it an offense to offer a specified stablecoin to the public in Hong Kong without proper authorization . Section 10 goes further to ban the advertising or promotion of any such activity. “ In accordance with Section 9 of the Stablecoins Ordinance, a person commits an offence if the person offers a specified stablecoin in Hong Kong without a licence or exemption ,” the Gazette filing states. Section 10 notes, “ It is an offence to advertise a regulated stablecoin activity or offering of a specified stablecoin unless licensed or exempted .” Under Part 6 of the ordinance, the Monetary Authority may impose sanctions on a regulated person, including fines or disqualification from holding executive roles in licensed entities. According to Section 133, those found guilty may be subject to “pecuniary penalties” payable to the government. The HKMA is mandated under Section 134 to take further administrative actions like issuing suspensions or revocation of licenses, depending on how severe the violation is. Public notice of such sanctions will be issued, as per Section 135, to ensure offending parties are exposed to reputational risks alongside legal consequences. 50 firms competing for limited licensing slots Bloomberg reported on Thursday that companies have begun submitting licensing applications to Hong Kong authorities, in preparation for the government-enacted August deadline. Sources close to the process told the publication that more than 50 firms are expected to apply beginning in August. Hong Kong financial watchdogs can only grant a fraction of these licenses. Among the applicants is state-backed brokerage institution Guotai Junan, which saw its shares surge by 300% after it received an extension to its banking license in June, allowing it to deal in digital assets. Also part of the submissions is ChinaAMC, one of the largest asset managers in Asia, recently launched a tokenized yuan money market fund that accepts subscriptions via stablecoins , even before any licenses were formally issued. Hong Kong’s regulatory opportunities The new licensing regime is part of the special administrative Chinese region’s plans to position itself as a digital asset hub distinct from Mainland China. In 2022, the city announced it would regulate crypto-related activities, contradicting Beijing’s crypto trading bans for the Mainland. Since then, Hong Kong has progressively opened regulated access for retail investors, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs) backed by Bitcoin and Ether. Licensed exchanges, custodians, and dealers have also begun operations under new compliance frameworks. “ Hong Kong will remain a testing ground for Greater China for tech firms or state-owned enterprises ,” Lily King, COO of digital custodian Cobo, told Bloomberg.

The company plans to use part of the funds to buy 2,900 Bitmain S21 Pro miners, aiming to deploy them in the next four to six months. Once live, the new hardware is expected to generate around $10 million in extra annual revenue, helping the company lower its already competitive breakeven point. Here’s what you should know. Why Bitzero Owns Its Mining Infrastructure Unlike most miners who rent third-party facilities, Bitzero owns its land, energy resources, and equipment. This gives it better control over energy costs and long-term profitability. “Deployment of this high-efficiency hardware will be completed within four to six months,” the company said in a statement , calling it a key step in extending its market lead. The company operates in Norway, Finland, and North Dakota, where colder climates help reduce energy usage. Combined with low-carbon, renewable energy sources, Bitzero’s strategy is built around long-term sustainability and profit, not short-term gains. Green Mining, Built for More Than Just Bitcoin Bitzero is positioning itself as a clean infrastructure provider for AI , cloud computing, and enterprise workloads, not just Bitcoin mining. Led by President and CEO Mohammed Bakhashwain, the firm is currently building four large-scale data centers across its existing locations. These are designed to handle high-performance computing with minimal environmental impact. “The world doesn’t just need more data centers, it needs better ones,” Bakhashwain said. “Our mission is simple: deliver high-performance computing power with the lowest environmental impact possible.” O’Leary Stands Behind Bitcoin, Criticizes Ethereum Kevin O’Leary has long supported the crypto industry, but when it comes to preference, he’s clear: Bitcoin over Ethereum. In an interview with CoinDe sk , O’Leary said Bitcoin is still the go-to asset for anyone looking for exposure to crypto volatility. “There’s a lot of people that say, ‘I don’t need anything else … I’ll just buy bitcoin.’ And they haven’t been wrong,” he said. He was less optimistic about Ethereum , calling it slow and inefficient. “Goodness, ETH is slow,” he added. “And the more transactions get piled on it, it doesn’t get any better.” With funding secured, high-efficiency miners on the way, and clean infrastructure at the center of its strategy, Bitzero is positioning itself for the next phase of crypto and AI-driven demand.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/kevin-oleary-backed-bitzero-raises-25m-to-scale-bitcoin-mining-infrastructure/,BTC|MINING|ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET,News,BTC,"Kevin O’Leary-Backed Bitzero Raises $25M to Scale Bitcoin Mining Infrastructure.

2025-07-24 13:59:11+00:00,Web3 scams surge past $3.1 billion in losses during first half of 2025,"The first half of 2025 has already proven catastrophic for the Web3 ecosystem, with blockchain security firm Hacken reporting over $3.1 billion in cumulative losses due to scams, breaches, and protocol failures. This figure already surpasses the full-year total of 2024, underscoring the scale of damage inflicted in just six months. The primary cause: access control failures, which contributed to roughly $1.83 billion in damages, including a landmark $1.46 billion Bybit exploit in February. Internal threats, compromised keys drive biggest breaches The largest single incident of the year was the Bybit attack, attributed to a compromised wallet signer that gave malicious actors full control of funds. Hackers used the vulnerability to drain assets undetected, exposing a significant weakness in private key storage and management. This was closely followed by the Infini Protocol attack , where a former developer exploited internal access to steal $50 million in a single transaction. The incident highlighted how insider threats remain an ongoing challenge for decentralised protocols, particularly those with incomplete governance or access restrictions. Geopolitical tensions also entered the spotlight when Iran’s Nobitex exchange lost $90 million in a breach that analysts suggest may have been politically motivated. The incident involved both phishing and technical compromise, combining multiple attack vectors for maximum impact. DeFi platforms suffer from flawed smart contracts Decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms were not spared. Hacken reported $263 million in total losses from smart contract vulnerabilities, mostly from bugs in logic and overflow checks. The most severe case involved Cetus , which saw $223 million drained in May. The bug was traced to a liquidity range miscalculation that allowed attackers to repeatedly withdraw unearned assets. These incidents show that many DeFi platforms continue to deploy unaudited or under-tested code, making them attractive targets for sophisticated exploits. Despite past lessons from similar vulnerabilities in 2020–2022, several protocols still struggle to implement robust logic checks and formal verification. Phishing scams and fake support schemes accelerate Phishing attacks surged to new records, accounting for $600 million in losses—also exceeding 2024’s full-year total. One of the most damaging cases involved an elderly US investor who lost $330 million in Bitcoin after falling prey to a multi-stage scam. Coinbase users were also targeted following a data breach. Using stolen credentials and customer details, scammers impersonated official Coinbase support staff. Victims were tricked into handing over seed phrases and two-factor passcodes, leading to more than $100 million in stolen funds. Additional scams included fake wallets, deceptive browser extensions, and token approval traps embedded in lookalike dApps. All these relied on social engineering and interface manipulation to extract funds without the victim realising it. AI-fuelled attacks rise 1000% with new tactics Artificial intelligence-related attacks are on the rise, with Hacken observing a 1000% increase compared to 2023. The majority of these breaches involved unsafe APIs, where attackers used prompt injection, fake AI agents, and vulnerable toolchains to hijack automation systems and user wallets. These methods bypass traditional cybersecurity protocols by exploiting emerging tech layers that are poorly understood or inadequately protected. As AI tools are increasingly integrated into DeFi, exchanges, and wallets, the attack surface is expanding rapidly, giving hackers new ways to bypass defences. With only half the year gone, the scale and sophistication of these breaches suggest that the crypto industry faces its most critical security moment in years. Security experts are now calling for urgent updates to access controls, contract audits, and AI usage guidelines to reduce further exposure.

While the broader altcoin market faces heightened volatility and notable losses, BTC remains relatively resilient, yet momentum appears uncertain. Analysts warn that if sentiment weakens, a broader correction could unfold. Related Reading: Ethereum Adoption Accelerates As Daily Transactions Set 2025 Record Top analyst Darkfost highlighted a critical dynamic now unfolding: the vulnerability of Short-Term Holders (STH). These investors, who entered the market during recent price surges, hold Bitcoin at significantly higher cost bases. As price action stalls or retraces, they’re typically the first to capitulate, creating increased selling pressure. With altcoins already under stress, all eyes remain on whether Bitcoin can hold above current support levels or if it, too, will start to crack under short-term selloffs. This phase could act as a stress test for recent buyers, while long-term holders and institutional participants continue to monitor key price zones. Key Realized Price Levels Suggest Bitcoin Structure Remains Bullish Darkfost has shared a chart offering a deep dive into Bitcoin’s realized prices across various holding cohorts, particularly focusing on Short-Term Holders (STHs). These metrics are proving crucial in identifying support zones that could be defended if the price continues to correct in the short term. The broader realized price for Bitcoin currently stands at $50.8K, while the annual average is significantly higher at $87.5K. More critically, the realized price for STHs—those who purchased coins recently—is positioned at $103.9K. Breaking this down further, we see realized prices by time held: STH 3m–6m: $88.2K STH 1m–3m: $104.1K STH 1w–1m: $113K These figures represent the average price at which different groups of recent investors acquired their coins. As such, they serve as psychological and technical support levels during corrections. With Bitcoin currently consolidating after a small retracement, bulls are eyeing these realized price zones to gauge whether the structure remains bullish. The $104K level, in particular, is essential—it aligns closely with the 1m–3m STH realized price and could serve as a decisive line for sentiment and price defense. If buyers can hold BTC above this level, the market’s bullish structure will likely remain intact, suggesting healthy consolidation rather than trend reversal. Conversely, losing it could trigger short-term panic selling among recent entrants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Still Reluctant To Sell – Supply Active Data Shows Room For Upside Bitcoin Price Analysis: Key Levels Hold After New Highs Bitcoin continues to consolidate in a tight range after setting fresh all-time highs earlier this month. As seen in the 3-day chart, BTC is holding above $115,724—a key horizontal support—and below immediate resistance near $122,077. This consolidation range has remained intact for over a week, reflecting both strong demand and hesitation near psychological resistance. Despite the recent small pullback, the overall market structure remains bullish. Price is trading well above the 50-day ($98,536), 100-day ($93,833), and 200-day ($76,201) simple moving averages, which continue to slope upward. This confirms strong medium- and long-term momentum.

Breaking this down further, we see realized prices by time held: STH 3m–6m: $88.2K STH 1m–3m: $104.1K STH 1w–1m: $113K These figures represent the average price at which different groups of recent investors acquired their coins. As such, they serve as psychological and technical support levels during corrections. With Bitcoin currently consolidating after a small retracement, bulls are eyeing these realized price zones to gauge whether the structure remains bullish. The $104K level, in particular, is essential—it aligns closely with the 1m–3m STH realized price and could serve as a decisive line for sentiment and price defense. If buyers can hold BTC above this level, the market’s bullish structure will likely remain intact, suggesting healthy consolidation rather than trend reversal. Conversely, losing it could trigger short-term panic selling among recent entrants.

As seen in the 3-day chart, BTC is holding above $115,724—a key horizontal support—and below immediate resistance near $122,077. This consolidation range has remained intact for over a week, reflecting both strong demand and hesitation near psychological resistance. Despite the recent small pullback, the overall market structure remains bullish. Price is trading well above the 50-day ($98,536), 100-day ($93,833), and 200-day ($76,201) simple moving averages, which continue to slope upward. This confirms strong medium- and long-term momentum.

In a recent X post, he reassured holders: “It’s a healthy correction. Nothing out of the ordinary in crypto. Sit back, chill, and relax… $10–$15 still in play.” A Natural Pullback After a Parabolic Surge The correction comes after a strong bullish run, and analysts agree it’s likely nothing more than a reset. XRP had broken above key resistance levels before retracing to test support zones between $3.10 and $3.30. According to technical indicators, XRP remains in a long-term uptrend, with this pullback allowing momentum to reset in preparation for the next leg higher. Market-wide consolidation is also a factor. Bitcoin has hovered just below $120,000, exerting downward pressure on altcoins like XRP. Moreover, traders appear to be rotating funds into other assets temporarily, leading to minor corrections across the board. $XRP went from $1.95 to $3.66, up 92% in 30 days.

These levels have historically acted as solid platforms for price rebounds.

What Happens If Whales Sell? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Bitcoin price USD has nearly doubled since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office, reaching an all-time high of $123,231. However, the recent shift into consolidation has triggered investor concerns, and experts are in a tug of war between bullish and bearish views, creating an uncertain atmosphere for its price action. The altcoins showing selling spikes are creating chaos for top crypto , as many are raising doubts that the current rally may be nearing exhaustion and a fall could be on the horizon. While others advocate it as a healthy halt. Bitcoin Price USD Shows Signs of Exhaustion Near $123K After a strong rally through the first half of the year, the Bitcoin price has successfully marked its latest peak at $123,231. This level was a new all-time high, pushing bullish sentiment to fresh highs. Yet, over the past few days, the rally has paused, and the Bitcoin price USD has transitioned into a sideways consolidation phase. When writing, the Bitcoin price today is exchanging hands at $118,681 with a 24-hour volume of $73.62 billion. Overall, it remains in a broader uptrend on the daily Bitcoin USD chart. However, market watchers are becoming cautious, particularly due to the rising wedge pattern forming in multi-month price action, which is raising the sweat. This pattern is typically associated with trend exhaustion and raises the possibility of a reversal, especially if selling pressure builds. Bull Flag and Pennant Patterns Signal Potential Continuation Despite concerns, some technical analysts believe the ongoing BTC price behavior may be a temporary pause rather than a topping formation. Prior to this consolidation, the Bitcoin price USD had broken out of a bullish flag pattern and its upside potential target is anticipated to be between $130K and $135K. Bitcoin is retesting the breakout of this bullish pennant formation. I think we will see a strong bounce here. pic.twitter.com/M1Nrjp6x5N — Mister Crypto (@misterrcrypto) July 24, 2025 Moreover, following the brief retreat from $123,231, BTC USD price action now appears to be forming a smaller bullish pennant, which is a continuation pattern that often emerges mid-rally. The breakout from this pennant has already occurred, and Bitcoin appears to be retesting for liquidity around the $118K – $120K zone, suggesting possible readiness for a renewed upward move. Retail Exit, Whale Entry: Supply Shift Could Drive Next Leg Beyond technical patterns, the on-chain data is another factor that adds optimism to the analysis. The data reveals that the wallets holding between “0.001 to 10 BTC” (largely considered retail investors) have shown a steady decline in activity. This is reflecting an ongoing trend of profit-taking and fear that the consolidation could mark a market top. In contrast, whale wallets holding “10,000 to 100,000 BTC” have increased their holdings during this pullback. This accumulation trend among large players hints that institutional confidence remains intact, and that the Bitcoin price USD could still make another attempt at new highs. Such a shift in supply ownership from retail to whale wallets hints towards the bullish BTC price continuation. Christmas Risk Looms if Whale Sentiment Shifts However, there remains one key risk that could threaten this outlook. If the current consolidation triggers not just retail exits but also prompts whales to offload their holdings to secure profits, then downside pressure could intensify.

The Bitpanda executive noted that it is difficult to pinpoint exactly where XRP is heading, but it is not impossible for the price to break above new ATHs. “While it''s difficult to pinpoint exact levels in such a fast-moving market, if market conditions remain favorable and capital flows continue to flow from Bitcoin to altcoins, a break above the current record high wouldn''t be surprising.” The Bitpanda executive stated that there is no clear catalyst that would make XRP outperform on its own, saying that XRP reaching new ATHs will likely depend on the overall altcoin market. “XRP''s short-term price trend will depend on whether the current bullish momentum in the altcoin market continues, as XRP tends to be quite sensitive to overall altcoin sentiment and regulatory rhetoric.” *This is not investment advice.
