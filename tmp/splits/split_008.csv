Atkins stated in his statement that, just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is not officially classified as a security by the SEC. “The SEC has unofficially stated that Ethereum is not a security. This is a similar approach to the assessment made for Bitcoin,” Atkins said, noting that the Ethereum blockchain is a fundamental building block for many digital assets.

2025-07-22 07:00:09+00:00,"Ethereum To $10,000? Analyst Says ETH Has To Break This Level","An analyst has explained how Ethereum could be eyeing $10,000 next, if it manages to break past the resistance line of this technical analysis pattern. Ethereum Is Nearing A Retest Of This Resistance Line In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how ETH is looking from the perspective of a technical analysis (TA) pattern. The pattern in question is a Parallel Channel, which forms whenever an asset’s price witnesses consolidation between two parallel trendlines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? There are a few different types of Parallel Channels, but the one of interest in the current discussion is the variant that has its trendlines parallel to the time-axis. This type appears when the cryptocurrency shows consolidation in an exactly sideways manner. Like other consolidation patterns in TA, the upper level of the Parallel Channel is assumed to be a source of resistance and the lower one that of support. A break out of either of these bounds can signal a continuation of trend in that direction. That is, a surge above the channel can be a bullish signal, while a fall below it may be a bearish one. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the Parallel Channel that the 1-week price of Ethereum has been trading inside for the last couple of years: As is visible in the above graph, Ethereum retested the lower level of the Parallel Channel earlier in the year and successfully found support at it. Since then, the coin has been marching up and its latest rally has brought it close to the upper level of the pattern, situated around $4,000. ETH has tested this level three times during the last couple of years and all of the instances resulted in it being rejected. In the scenario that the asset can find an escape this time, however, a bullish breakout might follow. “If Ethereum $ETH can break past $4,000, we could be looking at $10,000 next!” notes Martinez. The level is based on the fact that Parallel Channel breakouts can end up being of the same length as the height of the channel. It now remains to be seen if Ethereum will retest the upper level of the pattern in the near future and whether it would be able to find a break.

The latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights shows that Anne Arundel Dermatology (AAD) was hit by a hacking/IT incident, impacting 1,905,000 individuals. In a data breach notice to consumers, AAD says that an unknown entity gained unauthorized access to its systems and siphoned files containing customers’ personal or health information. The HIPAA Journal reports that the hacker may have stolen names, addresses, dates of birth, medical histories, health insurance records and other personal datasets. “Anne Arundel Dermatology recently identified an intrusion on certain of its systems by an unauthorized third party. We took immediate action to review this incident and secure our systems. Our review determined that certain data files were accessible to the unauthorized third party for a period of time. We subsequently performed an assessment of these data files and determined, on May 20th, 2025, that some of the files contained certain personal or health information when the unauthorized third party had access to them. Our review indicates that the unauthorized access may have begun on February 14th, 2025, and ended on May 13th, 2025.” AAD is a Maryland-based practice offering a comprehensive range of skincare solutions, including medical, surgical, cosmetic, pediatric and dermatopathology services.

2025-07-22 07:04:58+00:00,Leveraged Bearish Strategy ETF Pulls in Millions at Record Lows,"A U.S.-listed exchange-traded fund (ETF) offering leveraged bearish exposure to shares in bitcoin (BTC) holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) has recently attracted millions in investor money as its prices hit record lows. The Defiance Daily Target 2x Short MSTR ETF, listed under the ticker SMST on Nasdaq, has registered a net inflow of over $24 million since July 11, according to data tracked by VettaFi . The net inflow tallied over $10 million on July 16 alone, the biggest single-day total since March 26. The inflow likely represents bargain hunting at cheaper valuations. SMST fell to a high-volume record low of $17.68 last week as bitcoin''s bull run gathered pace, with prices hitting highs above $120,000. MSTR''s share price hit an eight-month high of $456. The 2x short ETF seeks to deliver daily investment results that are -200%, or minus 2x, the daily percentage change in the MSTR share price. The fund represents a bearish leveraged bet on MSTR. The ETF''s price rose 12% on Friday, nearing a log-scaled bearish trendline, which represents the sell-off since inception in August 2024. On Monday, it traded flat at around $20. Long ETF bleeds money The apparent bargain hunting in the short ETF has coincided with outflows from its 2x bullish counterpart, suggesting a potential shift in investor sentiment or a recalibration of directional bets. The Defiance Daily Target 2X Long MSTR ETF (MSTX) registered a net outflow of over $118 million since July 11.

Research firm Bernstein even predicts Bitcoin could reach $200K by early 2026 and says this cycle will likely be “long and exhausting.” .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-22 07:12:29+00:00,Why SpacePay Is the Altcoin Making Bitcoin Spendable Everywhere,"The post Why SpacePay Is the Altcoin Making Bitcoin Spendable Everywhere appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Most Bitcoin owners face the same problem every day. They have digital coins sitting in their wallets but can’t actually spend them anywhere useful. SpacePay is working to change this reality completely. This London-based fintech startup lets merchants accept crypto payments through their existing card machines, supporting over 325 different wallets. Everything gets instantly converted to local currency so businesses don’t worry about price swings. The platform has already raised over $1.2 million in its presale, with $SPY tokens currently priced at $0.003181. This Altcoin Solves Real Problems People Have SpacePay isn’t another speculative token promising magical returns. It’s built around solving a genuine issue that millions of crypto holders deal with daily. About 400 million people worldwide own cryptocurrency, but most places still won’t accept it as payment. The problem isn’t that business owners hate digital money. They just can’t justify the risks and complications. Setting up crypto payments usually means buying expensive new equipment, learning complicated systems, and gambling on volatile prices. Most shop owners take one look at that list and decide it’s not worth the trouble. SpacePay takes a completely different approach. SpacePay doesn’t ask businesses to rip out their payment systems and start over. It works with the equipment they’re already using. Those Android card readers sitting on counters everywhere? They can handle crypto payments after a simple software update. No new hardware needed. No weeks of staff training required. When someone pays with crypto, SpacePay instantly converts it to regular money for the merchant. A $50 meal stays exactly $50 in the restaurant’s account, even if Bitcoin crashes an hour later. This removes the biggest fear that keeps businesses away from digital payments. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1944775986718929052 Making Crypto Payments Work for Everyone The beauty of SpacePay’s system is how normal it feels. Customers just grab their phone, scan a code, and walk out. It takes maybe ten seconds – about the same as using Apple Pay. Since the platform works with hundreds of wallet apps, people can keep using whatever they’ve got installed. This flexibility matters more than you might think. Some folks prefer MetaMask while others use Trust Wallet or something completely different. SpacePay doesn’t care which app people choose. The system just works with all of them. The platform handles all the popular cryptocurrencies too. Ethereum, Binance Coin, USDT, and several others work without any problems. Users don’t need to convert their preferred coins before buying something. They can spend whatever they’re already holding. For merchants, the experience feels completely routine. They see a regular payment hitting their account in dollars, euros, or whatever currency they use. Behind the scenes, SpacePay handles all the technical complexity. The business owner never touches actual cryptocurrency. The fees are reasonable too. SpacePay charges just 0.5% per transaction while most traditional payment processors take 2% to 4%. A busy restaurant doing $40,000 monthly could save over $1,000 just by switching payment systems. That’s real money that goes straight to the bottom line. Visit SpacePay Presale The $SPY Token Creates Actual Value SpacePay runs on its native $SPY token, which offers holders several concrete benefits. Token owners get voting rights on platform decisions and new features. They receive monthly loyalty rewards based on their activity. Early access to new features gives them advantages over regular users. The revenue-sharing model stands out as particularly interesting. As more businesses process payments through SpacePay, token holders earn a portion of those transaction fees. This connects token value directly to platform success rather than pure speculation. SpacePay has created exactly 34 billion tokens total. Twenty percent goes to the public presale, while 17% rewards users for staying active. The rest funds development work, business partnerships, and marketing efforts. The founders kept just 5% for themselves, showing they’re focused on building something sustainable. Every three months, the team hosts video calls where token holders can actually talk with the leadership team. The team actually tells people what’s happening – the good stuff, the problems, and what they’re planning next. It’s nice to see a crypto project that doesn’t just post mysterious updates and disappear. Why This Approach Actually Works Most crypto payment solutions fail because they try to be too clever. They build fancy new systems that nobody wants to learn. SpacePay succeeds by keeping things simple and familiar. The timing looks perfect too. More people own crypto than ever before, but they still can’t spend it easily in most places.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again demonstrated its remarkable volatility and upward potential, breaching the significant $118,000 mark. This impressive climb, noted across major exchanges like the Binance USDT market, has sent ripples through the entire digital asset landscape, leaving investors and enthusiasts alike wondering: what’s next for the king of crypto? What Propelled the Bitcoin Price Beyond $118,000? The recent ascent of the Bitcoin price above $118,000 isn’t an isolated event but rather the culmination of several converging factors. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the often-unpredictable crypto markets. While a single definitive cause is rarely identifiable, a combination of macro and microeconomic forces often play a role. Increased Institutional Interest: A growing number of traditional financial institutions are either directly investing in Bitcoin or offering crypto-related products to their clients. This influx of large capital can significantly boost demand and, consequently, the Bitcoin price . Favorable Regulatory Developments: While regulation remains a complex topic, signs of clearer, more supportive regulatory frameworks in key jurisdictions can reduce uncertainty and encourage broader adoption. Positive news on this front often correlates with price increases. Halving Event Impact (Long-Term): Although not a direct immediate cause for a single day’s surge, the long-term effects of Bitcoin’s halving events (which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin) contribute to its scarcity and inherent value proposition, laying groundwork for future price appreciation. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic instability, inflation concerns, and a search for alternative stores of value often push investors towards assets like Bitcoin, which some view as “digital gold.” Analyzing the Market Movement: Where Does the Bitcoin Price Stand? According to real-time market monitoring, the Bitcoin price indeed pierced the $118,000 threshold, reaching as high as $118,000 on the Binance USDT market at the time of this observation. This level represents a significant psychological and technical resistance point for many traders. To put this into perspective, let’s consider some key metrics: Metric Value (Approx.) Significance Current Bitcoin Price $118,000 Key psychological and resistance level. 24-Hour Trading Volume Billions USD Indicates strong market activity and liquidity. Market Capitalization Trillions USD Reflects Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market. Previous Resistance Level (e.g., $115,000) The level from which the recent breakout occurred. This upward momentum often triggers a domino effect across altcoins, with many seeing gains as Bitcoin leads the charge. However, it’s essential to remember that while a surge is exciting, market volatility means that corrections can occur. What Are the Implications of This Bitcoin Price Milestone for Investors? For both seasoned and novice investors, a significant move in the Bitcoin price like this carries several implications: Benefits: Validation for HODLers: Long-term holders (HODLers) see their conviction rewarded, reinforcing the belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value appreciation. Increased Market Confidence: A strong Bitcoin performance often boosts overall confidence in the broader cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting new capital. Profit-Taking Opportunities: For short-term traders, this presents opportunities for profit-taking, especially for those who entered positions at lower price points. Challenges: Increased Volatility: Rapid price increases can be followed by sharp corrections, increasing the risk for new entrants or those trading on leverage. Fear of Missing Out (FOMO): The excitement can lead to impulsive decisions, causing investors to buy at the peak, only to face potential pullbacks. Market Manipulation Concerns: While the market matures, concerns about large whale movements or market manipulation persist, especially during periods of high volatility. Actionable Insights: Navigating these market conditions requires a strategic approach: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always verify information and understand the fundamentals before making investment decisions. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of trying to time the market, invest a fixed amount regularly, which can mitigate the impact of volatility. Set Realistic Expectations: Bitcoin’s journey is often characterized by significant swings. Don’t expect continuous parabolic gains without corrections. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is dominant, spreading investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies can reduce risk.

JPMorgan ( NYSE: JPM ) aims to let clients use their BTC ( BTC-USD ) and ETH ( ETH-USD ) as collateral to borrow loans, expanding beyond its current service of lending against crypto ETFs like BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ). The sources indicated that these plans are still under consideration and could change. CEO Jamie Dimon—who had earlier indicated that he was not a fan, ruling out getting into custody—now seems to have a softer tone on it. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy bitcoin. Go at it,” he said in May. The report pointed to Dimon’s early remarks about bitcoin, where he said he would fire any trader who traded it, which could have alienated some prospective clients who either had made their money through crypto assets or were long-term believers in their potential. The initiative aligns JPMorgan ( JPM ) with peers like Bank of America ( BAC ) and Citibank ( C ), which are also expanding into digital asset and stablecoin services. Potentially, JPMorgan’s ( JPM ) crypto-backed lending could further legitimize cryptocurrencies as collateral in mainstream finance and encourage other banks to follow suit, further accelerating crypto adoption in the broader financial system.

2025-07-22 07:27:07+00:00,What is Expected in the Fed’s Interest Rate Decision to be Announced Next Week? Research Company Reveals,"The Fed is expected to hold interest rates steady at its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on July 30, according to Yardeni Research. According to research data, the probability of a rate cut remains at just 4.7%. While the strong employment data released in June delayed short-term rate cut expectations, a moderate inflation report in September is expected to reinforce signals of a potential rate cut. While markets have been on the rise with better-than-expected earnings figures announced for the second quarter, it is stated that if the Fed gives dovish messages next week, new momentum may be experienced in the stock markets. Meanwhile, although it is claimed that Fed Chair Jerome Powell is under increasing pressure from the White House to lower interest rates, market experts and economists do not expect a dovish move from the central bank in the short term. Related News: BREAKING: MicroStrategy Makes New Announcement to Purchase Bitcoin One of the most significant reasons for this is that Powell cannot make decisions alone on the FOMC, which sets monetary policy. He is only one member of the 12-member board. Furthermore, the Fed has a dual mission: to keep inflation under control while ensuring maximum employment. The current strong labor market does not create an environment that necessitates interest rate cuts. Furthermore, any new tariffs that may be implemented in the coming period could increase inflation. The Federal Reserve has held the federal funds rate target steady between 4.25% and 4.50% since December. The bank, which also left the rate unchanged at its June meeting, based its decision on inflationary rigidity, the impact of trade tariffs, and the need for more data. *This is not investment advice.

The exchange has brought renewed focus to Portnoy’s involvement with cryptocurrency and his claim of being the leader of the XRP army. Portnoy recently admitted he no longer holds XRP . In the clip shared by Rietveld, Portnoy explained that he sold his holdings at $2.40 after being advised by a third party who expressed concerns about competition from Circle. Following his sale, XRP climbed to a new all-time high of $3.65, leaving Portnoy regretful. “It’s up 60% since I sold it, and I would have made millions.

Prominent XRP advocates have consistently advocated for holding the token , as its value extends beyond speculative trading. However, Portnoy’s decision to sell reveals that he was not invested for the long run as true XRP believers are, but was looking for a way to turn a quick profit. “You’re not the leader of the XRP army if you’re selling at $2.40,” Rietveld stated, highlighting the importance of conviction during a time when multiple bullish catalysts are coming together to boost the asset’s price.

Rietveld referenced the anticipated influx of trillions in liquidity and other positive factors that have strengthened XRP’s position in the market. Portnoy’s situation highlights a major challenge faced by investors navigating volatile markets.

Most drivers either had never heard of XRP or told him they don’t own any crypto at all. Only on the 25th ride did he hear a “yes.” Testing XRP Awareness Among Drivers Jakey’s sample was small but clear. He hopped into 25 different rides and got mostly blank looks when he mentioned XRP.

He said he plans to hold XRP for the long haul because of how it moves money across borders. Jakey has been a vocal skeptic.

2025-07-22 07:30:24+00:00,Ethereum Open Interest: Explosive $57.98 Billion Surge Signals Market Confidence,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Open Interest: Explosive $57.98 Billion Surge Signals Market Confidence The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with a monumental development: Ethereum open interest has shattered all previous records, reaching an astounding $57.98 billion! This unprecedented surge, as reported by CoinGlass data on July 22, marks a staggering increase of over 96% in just one month, with the total value of outstanding derivatives contracts denominated in ETH climbing to 15.69 million ETH. For anyone following the crypto markets, this isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal of growing conviction and potential future movements for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Understanding the Significance of Ethereum Open Interest Before diving deeper into what this record-breaking figure means, let’s clarify what ‘open interest’ truly represents. In the realm of derivatives trading, open interest refers to the total number of outstanding contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled or closed. It’s a crucial metric that provides insight into the liquidity and activity of a market. A high Ethereum open interest suggests a large number of participants are actively involved in the market, holding positions, and anticipating future price movements. Unlike trading volume, which measures the number of contracts traded over a specific period, open interest reflects the total amount of money committed to the market. When open interest rises, it indicates new money flowing into the market, either from new participants or existing ones increasing their exposure. Conversely, a decline suggests money is flowing out as contracts are closed. The recent data from CoinGlass paints a clear picture of this incredible growth: Metric Value (July 22) Compared to Previous Month Percentage Change Open Interest (ETH) 15.69 million ETH Approx. 8 million ETH +96% Open Interest (USD) $57.98 billion Approx. $29.5 billion +96% What Drives Such a Massive Ethereum Open Interest Surge? Several converging factors are likely contributing to this monumental rise in Ethereum open interest . Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the market’s current sentiment and potential future direction: Spot ETH ETF Speculation: The ongoing anticipation and regulatory developments surrounding a potential spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States have undoubtedly fueled significant institutional and retail interest. An approved ETF would open the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the asset, leading to increased demand across all related financial products, including derivatives. Upcoming Network Upgrades: Ethereum’s continuous development roadmap, including planned upgrades like the Dencun and Pectra updates, promises enhanced scalability, efficiency, and security. These technological advancements make the network more attractive for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and enterprise solutions, boosting long-term confidence in ETH. Broader Crypto Market Recovery: Following periods of consolidation, the wider cryptocurrency market has shown signs of renewed strength. Bitcoin’s resilience and the overall positive sentiment across major digital assets often spill over into Ethereum, encouraging more aggressive positioning in its derivatives market. Increased Institutional Participation: Large financial institutions are increasingly looking at crypto assets as legitimate investment vehicles. As more institutional capital enters the market, their preference for regulated and sophisticated financial instruments like futures and options naturally drives up open interest figures. DeFi Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum remains the bedrock of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. As DeFi protocols innovate and expand, the underlying demand for ETH as collateral, gas, and a base asset in these systems grows, which can indirectly influence derivatives positioning. Navigating the Waves: What Opportunities and Risks Does High Ethereum Open Interest Present? While a surging Ethereum open interest is often interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating strong conviction among traders, it’s essential to understand that it also comes with increased volatility and potential risks. The derivatives market is a double-edged sword, offering amplified gains but also magnified losses. Opportunities: Potential for Strong Price Movements: High open interest, especially when coupled with increasing prices, can suggest a strong bullish trend is forming, as more money is betting on price appreciation. Enhanced Liquidity: A larger number of open contracts means a deeper market, making it easier for large traders to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting prices.

On July 17, they moved a massive 61,000 BTC to exchanges, marking the biggest single-day inflow in over a year. This triggered a 4% dip, pulling Bitcoin down from its $123K high to around $117K–$118K. Cryptoquant analysts note that over the past few days, BTC inflows to exchanges jumped by nearly $17B, rising from $28B to $45B between July 14–18. The spike in inflows was similar to what was seen at the previous market tops. This suggests that whales may have used Bitcoin’s new all-time high to take profits. However, the daily inflows are now declining, and if the trend continues, it could help ease selling pressure and give the market some breathing room.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/spacex-just-moved-152-million-in-bitcoin-are-whales-dumping/,BTC|MARKET|ARKM|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,News|Bitcoin|Crypto news,BTC,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX Just Moved $152 Million in Bitcoin, Are Whales Dumping?.

This triggered a 4% dip, pulling Bitcoin down from its $123K high to around $117K–$118K. Cryptoquant analysts note that over the past few days, BTC inflows to exchanges jumped by nearly $17B, rising from $28B to $45B between July 14–18. The spike in inflows was similar to what was seen at the previous market tops. This suggests that whales may have used Bitcoin’s new all-time high to take profits. However, the daily inflows are now declining, and if the trend continues, it could help ease selling pressure and give the market some breathing room."

2025-07-22 07:45:19+00:00,Bitcoin Price: CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Remarkable $139K Target Without Overheating,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: CryptoQuant Analyst Reveals Remarkable $139K Target Without Overheating Are you keeping a close eye on the cryptocurrency markets? The world of digital assets is constantly buzzing with predictions and analyses, but few capture attention quite like a bold forecast for the future of Bitcoin. Recently, a prominent analyst from CryptoQuant, Axel Adler Jr., shared an intriguing perspective that suggests the Bitcoin price could soar to an impressive $139,000 without entering what he terms an ‘overheated’ phase. This isn’t just a random guess; it’s based on specific on-chain metrics that paint a compelling picture of continued growth potential. For anyone invested in or considering the world’s leading cryptocurrency, understanding this outlook is crucial. What’s Driving This Bitcoin Price Optimism? The core of Adler Jr.’s analysis lies in CryptoQuant’s unique framework, which identifies specific zones for Bitcoin’s market behavior. Currently, with the Bitcoin price hovering around $117,000, it resides comfortably within what’s called the ‘growth zone.’ This zone is defined by two key levels: the Investor Price Median and the Hype Alert level. The Investor Price Median, currently sitting around $92,000, represents a baseline of strong investor accumulation and conviction. It suggests that a significant portion of the market is holding Bitcoin with a long-term view, providing a robust foundation for upward movement. On the other hand, the Hype Alert level, pegged at $139,000, signifies the point at which the market might start showing signs of excessive optimism or ‘overheating.’ What’s remarkable about Adler Jr.’s current assessment is that the Bitcoin price can reach this $139,000 mark without necessarily triggering the ‘overheated’ status. This implies that even at that elevated level, there would still be underlying buying support and a healthy market structure, rather than a speculative bubble on the verge of popping. This nuanced perspective offers a refreshing take in a market often characterized by rapid, unpredictable swings. Understanding the Bitcoin Price ‘Growth Zone’ To truly grasp the significance of CryptoQuant’s analysis, it’s essential to delve deeper into what these ‘zones’ represent for the Bitcoin price . These aren’t just arbitrary numbers; they are derived from sophisticated on-chain data analysis, tracking the behavior of various market participants, from long-term holders to short-term speculators. The ‘growth zone’ is essentially a sweet spot where fundamental accumulation meets healthy market interest, allowing for sustainable price appreciation. Let’s break down the key levels: Investor Price Median ($92,000): This level acts as a strong support base. It represents the average acquisition cost for a significant segment of long-term investors. When the Bitcoin price stays above this, it indicates that these investors are in profit and less likely to sell, providing a stable floor. It’s a testament to the underlying demand from those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Hype Alert Level ($139,000): This is the upper boundary of the growth zone. While reaching this level is significant, Adler Jr.’s point is that it doesn’t automatically signal a market top or an impending crash. Instead, it’s the point where caution might become necessary, but not necessarily panic. The absence of ‘overheating’ at this level implies that demand is still organic and not solely driven by speculative frenzy. This framework allows analysts to gauge market sentiment and health more accurately than just looking at price charts alone. It provides a window into the collective psychology and conviction of Bitcoin holders, which is a powerful indicator for future Bitcoin price movements. Is This Bitcoin Price Prediction Realistic? A $139,000 Bitcoin price target might sound ambitious to some, especially given the cryptocurrency’s notorious volatility. However, several factors lend credibility to such a projection, particularly when viewed through the lens of fundamental analysis and historical cycles. Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC entering the market, have historically preceded significant bull runs. While the most recent halving has passed, its full supply-side impact often unfolds over the subsequent months and years. Furthermore, increasing institutional adoption continues to be a major catalyst. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in major markets has opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, bringing in substantial capital. Large corporations and even some sovereign nations are also exploring or implementing Bitcoin into their treasuries or financial systems, further solidifying its position as a legitimate asset class. These factors contribute to a growing demand side that can absorb higher prices without necessarily becoming ‘overheated.’ However, it’s equally important to consider potential challenges.

XRP/BTC Rally Is Just the Beginning appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the last 30 days, XRP price has surged an impressive 67.2%, outperforming almost every major cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin (14.4%), Ethereum (62.1%), Solana (45.5%), BNB (19.5%), and Cardano (58.3%). In just the past seven days, XRP jumped another 21%, reaching $3.47. But that’s not all on the XRP/BTC chart; a major technical development has caught the crypto world’s attention. XRP/BTC Nears 8-Year Resistance Breakout Currently, the XRP/BTC pair is trading at 0.00002952 BTC. According to renowned crypto trader Gordon , the pair is on the verge of breaking through a key resistance level that has held firm for eight years. At the start of this month, XRP/BTC was at 0.00002052 BTC, and since then, it has climbed a staggering 43.63%. Between July 6 and July 17, the pair soared by 42.53%, with 11 bullish daily candles and a 14.17% single-day jump on July 17. Gordon calls this moment a “rare, generational wealth opportunity”, hinting at a possible long-term rally for XRP price. XRP Spot ETF Approval Could Be the Next Big Trigger While several XRP ETFs based on futures and leverage—like those from ProShares and Teucrium—are already live in the U.S., the market is still waiting for the SEC to approve a spot XRP ETF . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction As Tokenized RWAs on XRPL Soar 2260% , Following the SEC vs. Ripple lawsuit resolution, the approval of a spot XRP ETF could be a powerful catalyst that pushes the XRP price even higher. Interestingly, the current rally is unfolding without this major trigger, indicating strong organic momentum. What’s Next for XRP Price? With the SEC lawsuit settled, institutional interest rising, and Ripple’s cross-border payment adoption expanding, the outlook for XRP price remains bullish. Gordon believes that if momentum continues, XRP could hit $10 or more by 2025 . The XRP/BTC breakout, combined with growing investor confidence and pending spot ETF approvals, could mark the beginning of a powerful rally.

2025-07-22 07:55:23+00:00,Hyperliquid Whale Unleashes Audacious $100M Bitcoin Long: A Risky Bet?,"BitcoinWorld Hyperliquid Whale Unleashes Audacious $100M Bitcoin Long: A Risky Bet? In the fast-paced, high-stakes world of cryptocurrency, moments of sheer audacity often capture the market’s attention. One such moment recently unfolded on Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange, where a single Hyperliquid whale made a move that sent ripples across the crypto community. Imagine placing a bet so massive, so leveraged, that it could either lead to unimaginable wealth or catastrophic loss. This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what transpired when a trader known as AguilaTrades opened a staggering $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) long position with 40x leverage. This bold maneuver at an entry price of $118,056 has become a focal point of discussion, highlighting the exhilarating, yet perilous, nature of high-leverage trading in the digital asset space. The Audacious Move: Unpacking the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bet The crypto market thrives on volatility and the ambitious plays of its largest participants. When an on-chain analyst, @ai_9684xtpa, brought the activities of AguilaTrades to light on X, the details were nothing short of breathtaking. This particular Hyperliquid whale initiated a 40x leveraged long position on Bitcoin, committing a colossal $100 million. At an entry price of $118,056, this translates to a total position size of approximately 840 BTC, which, at the time of reporting, had already swelled in value to around $108 million. Such a move isn’t just about the numbers; it’s a testament to the immense conviction—or perhaps extreme risk appetite—of the individual behind the trade. To put this into perspective, a 40x leverage means that for every dollar the trader put up as collateral, they are effectively controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. While this amplifies potential gains exponentially, it also magnifies losses at an alarming rate. A slight adverse price movement could lead to rapid liquidation, wiping out the entire collateral. This specific Hyperliquid whale trade serves as a stark reminder of the double-edged sword that leverage represents in the crypto derivatives market. What Exactly is a Hyperliquid Whale, and Why Does It Matter? In cryptocurrency parlance, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to influence market prices. A Hyperliquid whale , specifically, is a large holder or trader operating on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange. Their actions are closely watched because their trades, due to their sheer size, can impact market sentiment and even price movements. When a whale takes such a substantial position, it often sparks speculation: Are they privy to insider information? Do they see a major market shift coming? Or are they simply making a highly speculative bet? Hyperliquid itself is a relatively new but rapidly growing decentralized perpetual futures exchange. It stands out for its low latency, high throughput, and the ability to handle large orders, making it attractive for professional traders and, indeed, whales. The transparency of on-chain data, as leveraged by analysts like @ai_9684xtpa, allows the broader community to observe these large trades, offering a glimpse into the strategies and risk appetites of the market’s biggest players. Navigating the High Seas of Leverage: What Does 40x Really Mean? Leverage is a powerful tool in trading, allowing participants to amplify their exposure to an asset with a relatively small amount of capital. However, with great power comes great risk. For a Hyperliquid whale to utilize 40x leverage means that for every 1% price movement in their favor, their profit on the collateral is 40%. Conversely, a 1% move against them results in a 40% loss of their collateral. This extreme amplification means that even minor market fluctuations can have drastic consequences. Consider the liquidation price. With 40x leverage, a long position like AguilaTrades’ would face liquidation if Bitcoin’s price were to drop by just over 2.5% from the entry price. Given Bitcoin’s historical volatility, a 2.5% drop can occur within minutes or hours, making such a position incredibly precarious. This is not a strategy for the faint of heart, nor for those without deep pockets to withstand potential drawdowns or rapid liquidations. To illustrate the inherent risk, here’s a simplified table showing the approximate percentage drop required for liquidation at different leverage levels: Leverage Multiplier Approximate % Price Drop for Liquidation (Long Position) 5x 20% 10x 10% 20x 5% 40x 2.5% 50x 2% 100x 1% The Allure and the Abyss: Potential Rewards and Catastrophic Risks The decision by a Hyperliquid whale to take on such a highly leveraged position is driven by the potential for monumental gains. If Bitcoin were to continue its upward trajectory, even a modest percentage increase could translate into millions of dollars in profit for AguilaTrades.

BitcoinWorld Hyperliquid Whale Unleashes Audacious $100M Bitcoin Long: A Risky Bet? In the fast-paced, high-stakes world of cryptocurrency, moments of sheer audacity often capture the market’s attention. One such moment recently unfolded on Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange, where a single Hyperliquid whale made a move that sent ripples across the crypto community. Imagine placing a bet so massive, so leveraged, that it could either lead to unimaginable wealth or catastrophic loss. This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario; it’s precisely what transpired when a trader known as AguilaTrades opened a staggering $100 million Bitcoin (BTC) long position with 40x leverage. This bold maneuver at an entry price of $118,056 has become a focal point of discussion, highlighting the exhilarating, yet perilous, nature of high-leverage trading in the digital asset space. The Audacious Move: Unpacking the Hyperliquid Whale’s Bet The crypto market thrives on volatility and the ambitious plays of its largest participants. When an on-chain analyst, @ai_9684xtpa, brought the activities of AguilaTrades to light on X, the details were nothing short of breathtaking. This particular Hyperliquid whale initiated a 40x leveraged long position on Bitcoin, committing a colossal $100 million. At an entry price of $118,056, this translates to a total position size of approximately 840 BTC, which, at the time of reporting, had already swelled in value to around $108 million. Such a move isn’t just about the numbers; it’s a testament to the immense conviction—or perhaps extreme risk appetite—of the individual behind the trade. To put this into perspective, a 40x leverage means that for every dollar the trader put up as collateral, they are effectively controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. While this amplifies potential gains exponentially, it also magnifies losses at an alarming rate. A slight adverse price movement could lead to rapid liquidation, wiping out the entire collateral. This specific Hyperliquid whale trade serves as a stark reminder of the double-edged sword that leverage represents in the crypto derivatives market. What Exactly is a Hyperliquid Whale, and Why Does It Matter? In cryptocurrency parlance, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to influence market prices. A Hyperliquid whale , specifically, is a large holder or trader operating on the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange. Their actions are closely watched because their trades, due to their sheer size, can impact market sentiment and even price movements. When a whale takes such a substantial position, it often sparks speculation: Are they privy to insider information? Do they see a major market shift coming? Or are they simply making a highly speculative bet? Hyperliquid itself is a relatively new but rapidly growing decentralized perpetual futures exchange. It stands out for its low latency, high throughput, and the ability to handle large orders, making it attractive for professional traders and, indeed, whales. The transparency of on-chain data, as leveraged by analysts like @ai_9684xtpa, allows the broader community to observe these large trades, offering a glimpse into the strategies and risk appetites of the market’s biggest players.

This surge followed the company’s announcement that it had invested $2 billion in Bitcoin (BTC). Two-Thirds Of Assets To Bitcoin Treasury The media group, which encompasses President Donald Trump’s social media platform Truth Social, the streaming service Truth+, and the financial services brand Truth.Fi, revealed that the recent cryptocurrency purchases align with a strategy initially outlined in May to establish a Bitcoin treasury. According to Trump Media, these Bitcoin assets now represent two-thirds of its total $3 billion in assets, signaling a deepened financial commitment to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: $331M In Shorts At Risk As Ethereum Targets Key Supply Level Devin Nunes, CEO and president of Trump Media, emphasized the company’s unwavering focus on executing its publicly announced strategy. He stated that these assets are designed to secure the company’s “financial independence” and protect it from potential discrimination by financial institutions. Furthermore, Nunes mentioned plans to introduce a utility token within the Truth Social ecosystem, which could enhance user engagement and create new revenue streams. In addition to acquiring Bitcoin, Trump Media has allocated $300 million towards an “options acquisition strategy” focused on Bitcoin-related securities. Trump’s Regulatory Push Trump’s support for a more supportive regulatory environment in Washington, D.C., has resulted in significant price increases and surging adoption by public traded companies in the digital asset industry. Recently, President Trump signed legislation that establishes the first federal framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, a significant endorsement expected to foster greater adoption of these digital assets under the GENIUS Act. This move coincides with the launch of World Liberty Financial, a new crypto startup supported by Trump and his sons, which recently introduced its own US dollar-pegged stablecoin, USD1, in collaboration with BitGo.

2025-07-22 08:07:28+00:00,What’s Next for Bitcoin as ETFs Surge and Corporates Turn to BTC for Yield,"Bitcoin’s momentum shows no signs of slowing. Now trading around $118,500, the $2.36 trillion asset continues to ride a wave of institutional demand, buoyed by record ETF inflows and a growing push from corporate treasuries. In July, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw only one day of outflows, on the 1st. Since then, they have recorded 10 straight days of inflows totaling $5.227 billion, according to Farside . With that, Bitcoin ETF issuers now hold $152.40 billion in total net assets. BlackRock’s IBIT leads the pack, capturing $56 billion in total net inflows. Meanwhile, more public companies are ramping up their Bitcoin allocations. Corporate treasuries have been buying more BTC than ETFs for three consecutive quarters now. In the second quarter, public companies acquired about 131,000 coins, as per the data from Bitcoin Treasuries . So, Michael Saylor’s Strategy isn’t alone in its aggressive Bitcoin buys, though it certainly leads with 576,230 BTC , which is 2.74% of BTC’s total supply. According to Rich Rines, Initial Contributor at Core , this “growing adoption of Bitcoin as a treasury asset amid economic uncertainties” could accelerate the momentum that started with Bitcoin halving and has been aided by pro-industry bills. Against this backdrop, the market is looking primed for much higher prices. Already, BTC is up 83.2% in the past year, now helping the broad crypto market finally rally too. “The remainder of 2025 looks exceptionally promising for the crypto market, particularly for Bitcoin,” said Rich. With the momentum “driven by increasing institutional adoption, macroeconomic tailwinds, and clearer regulatory frameworks,” Rich added, “this translates to accelerated growth in Bitcoin treasury strategies, where companies are succeeding with large-scale holding and now exploring ways to earn low-risk yield on those assets without compromising self-custody.” Bitcoin treasury companies started as pure BTC holders but have since scaled into yield-generating tools. For instance, Strategy is offering 11.5% yield on its new preferred stock, which is collateralized by its BTC reserves. This evolution from buy-and-hold into structured, capital-efficient yield vehicles is expected to help the Bitcoin DeFi sector grow as well. Bitcoin DeFi, or BTCFi, is a growing ecosystem of DeFi applications built on the Bitcoin blockchain or its layer-2 solutions. It allows users to leverage their Bitcoin holdings in various financial activities like lending, borrowing, and staking, previously not possible within the traditional Bitcoin ecosystem. Core, for instance, is actively transforming idle Bitcoin into a productive, yield-generating asset through self-custodial BTC staking. Already, the total value locked (TVL) in the BTCFi sector has surged past $7 billion . This marks a significant increase from approximately $300 million in TVL at the beginning of 2024, showing enthusiasm among both retail and institutions to bring yield-generation strategies to Bitcoin and transcend its role as a passive store of value. “As more Bitcoin holders seek productive uses for their holdings, Bitcoin-aligned ecosystems are positioned to capture significant market share. Bitcoin DeFi developments can transform idle Bitcoin into a more versatile asset that supports broader applications,” said Rich. The outlook for BTC prices and Bitcoin DeFi (BTCFi) remains constructive, driven by growing institutional participation and an expanding range of use cases. As the ecosystem matures, continued progress in corporate adoption and infrastructure innovation will be key to shaping long-term market dynamics. The rise of corporate treasury strategies has contributed meaningfully to recent price momentum, though it also increases sensitivity to broader market conditions. These approaches often benefit from sustained price appreciation, which may be tested during periods of consolidation. Other potential headwinds for Bitcoin, according to Rich, include heightened volatility from geopolitical events, tariff impacts, and unexpected Fed policy shifts, all of which could “trigger pullbacks.” Overall, sentiment remains positive. ETF flows, central bank direction, and the evolution of corporate Bitcoin strategies will be important indicators. Sustained strength in these areas could further reinforce Bitcoin’s role as a productive, yield-bearing asset class, particularly as platforms like Core continue to unlock new functionality for institutional holders.

The firm used a market impulse indicator to report that weak altseasons occur when Bitcoin is strong, characterized by “short bursts and limited rotation.” Meanwhile, strong altseasons require real capital flow where Bitcoin loses relative strength, dominance drops, altcoins break out broadly, it stated, before adding: “We’re at that decision point now. Bitcoin is slowing down, capital rotation has started.” 75% of altcoins are at resistance. This is where altseasons either start or fail. Weak altseasons (light green area) happen when Bitcoin is strong — short bursts, limited rotation. Strong altseasons require real capital flow: Bitcoin loses relative strength, dominance drops,… pic.twitter.com/BsS0poagUk — Swissblock (@swissblock__) July 21, 2025 Altseason Indicators Bitcoin has retreated 4.7% from its all-time high, dipping below $117,000 briefly during the Tuesday morning Asian trading session. Additionally, its dominance has also declined 8.5% to below 59% over the past few weeks, mainly at the expense of Ethereum, which has been on fire.

Around three-quarters of altcoins are at resistance, and this is where “altseasons either start or fail,” reported Swissblock on Monday. The firm used a market impulse indicator to report that weak altseasons occur when Bitcoin is strong, characterized by “short bursts and limited rotation.” Meanwhile, strong altseasons require real capital flow where Bitcoin loses relative strength, dominance drops, altcoins break out broadly, it stated, before adding: “We’re at that decision point now. Bitcoin is slowing down, capital rotation has started.” 75% of altcoins are at resistance. This is where altseasons either start or fail.

The crypto hadn’t been touched in over three years. The only action before the transfer was a tiny test transaction of 0.000248 BTC (less than $30) sent to Coinbase Prime, likely to confirm the path before shifting the full amount. Once the test went through, the massive amount was sent in a single shot. Despite the transaction’s size, the fee paid was just 0.00024831 BTC, or roughly $29. That’s less than what you’d pay for a decent lunch, and it moved nine figures’ worth of Bitcoin. Source: Arkham Intelligence. The receiving address hasn’t spent a single coin so far. That points to a potential cold storage reshuffle or internal security upgrade, not a sale. SpaceX still holds over 6,900 BTC under Coinbase Prime Blockchain logs show that SpaceX had received multiple large deposits from Coinbase between three and four years ago. These transfers ranged from 1,100 to 1,279 BTC each. Back when Bitcoin was peaking during the 2021 bull run, those holdings were worth over $1.6 billion. As of now, Arkham Intelligence’s tracking says the company’s Bitcoin reserves are sitting at around 6,977 BTC, currently held with Coinbase Prime. With today’s market value, that equals roughly $818.3 million, almost half of what it was during the all-time highs. The first real public confirmation of SpaceX’s Bitcoin investment came in 2021, when Elon Musk said the company had bought in, though he never mentioned how much. Reports that followed showed the firm had about $373 million in BTC on its balance sheet that year. What happened next wasn’t exactly bullish. Internal records showed the company had written down $373 million in losses across 2021 and 2022 and may have sold some or all of its Bitcoin. But the recent wallet move makes it clear they still have a large stack. Documents released at the time confirmed SpaceX had booked the BTC as part of its assets, but never made it clear if it dumped the full amount. Elon’s statement followed shortly after Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin buy, a move that shot Bitcoin to new highs. Then, in Q2 2022, Tesla sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings for $936 million, leaving just $184 million worth on the books. While SpaceX quietly repositions its crypto, the Bitcoin network is also showing some important signs. The asset’s price has cooled slightly in the last week, down about 3%, now trading just under $119,000. After a steady climb over several months, both retail and institutional traders appear to be reassessing their exposure. On-chain analyst Avocado, writing for CryptoQuant, pointed to a continued drop in Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) count, a key indicator of blockchain activity. He said the decline started around December 2024 and hasn’t stopped. Avocado explained, “The post-ETF approval environment has driven more assets into secure wallets, moving funds off exchanges into institutional-grade custody.” This reduces the number of small transaction outputs and makes the blockchain leaner and more efficient. It also means less near-term liquidity, with more Bitcoin going into long-term cold storage rather than staying on exchanges ready to trade.

He gave the date!","Fundstrat co-founder and Bitmine Technologies CEO Tom Lee, who has made a name for himself with his bold predictions about Bitcoin and the market, announced his new predictions. Speaking to CNBC, Tom Lee shared his price expectations, stating that the rise in Bitcoin and Ethereum is not over yet. Lee noted that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a macro asset like gold, and this shift in perception is driving more capital into the market. At this point, Lee argued that Bitcoin would reach $250,000 by the end of this year. Lee stated that even at $250,000, BTC would only be worth 25% of the gold market, highlighting how much potential Bitcoin still has. Ethereum on the Rise! Lee, who also announced his price prediction for Ethereum in addition to Bitcoin, predicted that Ethereum would rise to $4,000 in the short term by the end of July and to $15,000 in the medium term by the end of the year. Lee stated that he is confident in his prediction and said that Ethereum''s recent performance and strong fundamentals will support this rise. The expert noted that he sees the $5,000 level as a technical turning point as Ethereum surpasses its previous record high. Lee, who attributed Ethereum''s upward trend to its compliance with US regulations and its growing utility in the global financial sphere, said that renewed interest from institutional investors will accelerate Ethereum''s growth and rise. At this point, Lee claimed that the institutional narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold is still intact, but ETH could offer more upside potential in the next few years due to it being the network through which institutions tokenize financial assets. “Wall Street wants to find a large chain that operates compliantly in the U.S. and already has a lot of real-world assets.

2025-07-22 08:55:17+00:00,Binance BTC Transfer: Unveiling a Strategic $77.4M Move to Ceffu,"BitcoinWorld Binance BTC Transfer: Unveiling a Strategic $77.4M Move to Ceffu In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, significant asset movements often capture the attention of investors and analysts. Recently, a notable Binance BTC transfer occurred, signaling a strategic operational move by one of the globe’s leading crypto exchanges. Blockchain tracking service Whale Alert reported a substantial transfer of 656 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at approximately $77.4 million, from Binance Exchange to Ceffu, Binance’s dedicated institutional custody platform. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it offers a compelling insight into the advanced security measures and operational strategies employed by major players in the crypto space. What does this massive Binance BTC transfer signify for the broader crypto ecosystem and the security of institutional funds? Understanding the Strategic Binance BTC Transfer The recent Binance BTC transfer , as reported by Whale Alert, involved a significant amount of Bitcoin moving between entities closely associated with Binance. This was an internal relocation of assets to a highly specialized custody solution, not a transfer to an external wallet or exchange. Such large-scale movements are meticulously tracked by blockchain analytics firms for insights into market dynamics or shifts in institutional strategies. Here’s a snapshot of this particular Binance BTC transfer : Detail Description Amount Transferred 656 BTC Approximate Value $77.4 million Source Binance Exchange Destination Ceffu (Binance’s institutional custody platform) This type of substantial Binance BTC transfer is a crucial aspect of managing vast digital asset reserves. It highlights the evolving infrastructure of crypto, particularly how exchanges secure client funds, especially for high-net-worth and institutional clients. Why is a Binance BTC Transfer to Ceffu Crucial? A Binance BTC transfer to an institutional custody platform like Ceffu carries significant implications beyond a simple transaction. It’s a strategic decision focused on security, regulatory adherence, and building client trust. Institutional custody solutions offer enhanced security measures far exceeding standard exchange hot or cold wallets, often incorporating multi-signature schemes, hardware security modules (HSMs), and stringent operational procedures to mitigate risks like hacking or fraud. The crucial aspects include: Unmatched Security: Ceffu specializes in secure asset management for institutions. Moving a large sum via this Binance BTC transfer indicates a commitment to the highest security protocols for these specific funds, likely managed for institutional clients. Regulatory Alignment: Institutional custody providers typically adhere to strict regulatory frameworks, including regular audits and robust AML/KYC. This move aligns with Binance’s efforts to meet global regulatory standards for institutional offerings. Enhanced Client Confidence: For institutional clients, knowing their assets are held by a dedicated, secure custody provider like Ceffu, separate from the exchange’s operational wallets, significantly boosts trust in Binance’s services. Operational Segregation: Separating institutional assets into a dedicated custody solution improves operational efficiency and risk management, ensuring client funds are distinct from the exchange’s proprietary assets. Ultimately, this Binance BTC transfer underscores a commitment to providing enterprise-grade security and services for significant asset holders within the Binance ecosystem. Ceffu: Securing Your Binance BTC Transfer and More Ceffu, formerly Binance Custody, is Binance’s independent, institutional-grade custody solution. It was created to meet the rigorous demands of institutional investors—such as hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations—who require specialized security for their substantial digital asset holdings. Ceffu operates as a standalone entity, though closely affiliated with Binance, ensuring clear operational separation and enhanced governance. Ceffu’s robust approach to securing assets, including those involved in a Binance BTC transfer , typically encompasses: Dominant Cold Storage: The vast majority of assets are kept offline, significantly reducing online hack risks. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Technology: This advanced cryptographic technique allows multiple parties to jointly compute a function while keeping their inputs private, eliminating single points of failure for private keys. Air-Gapped Systems: Transaction signing systems are often physically isolated from unsecured networks. Regular Audits & Insurance: Reputable custodians like Ceffu undergo independent security audits and may offer insurance against certain losses, further enhancing confidence. The utilization of Ceffu for this significant Binance BTC transfer exemplifies Binance’s multi-layered security architecture, designed to protect assets across various risk exposures.

Given its recent climb of over 18% in a week, a continued rise could mean significant gains, possibly more than 20% from its current range. Keep an eye on the trends; Solana’s making waves.

2025-07-22 08:59:58+00:00,Ether Prints ''Doji'' as XRP Teases Double Top at $3.65,"This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Ether: Signs of Indecision ETH''s Doji candle on Monday signals indecision in the market following a near 90-degree rise from $2,100 to $3,800 in less than four weeks. The pattern has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook, establishing Monday''s high of $3,859 as the level to beat for the bulls. Note that the $3,800-$4,100 range is where ether topped out in March 2024, May 2024 and December 2024. While prices remain below Monday''s high, the focus will be on the bearish shift in intraday indicators and the possibility of a notable price pullback. Price action on the 15-minute candlestick chart indicates a breakdown of the head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. The bearish pattern suggests a potential price drop to $3,550. Supporting the interim bear case is the hourly chart, where prices have crossed below the Ichimoku cloud, signaling a bearish shift in momentum. AI''s take: Traders should be cautious, watching if ETH can definitively break and hold above this multi-month ceiling ($3,800-$4,100) or if a pullback is imminent from this historically topped-out zone. Resistance: $4,000, $4,109 , $4,382. Support: $3,480, $3,081, $2,879. XRP: Double top Since Friday, XRP has largely traded within a range, with upside capped above $3.60 and support at around $3.35. The sideways churn resembles a typical temporary bull breather observed after strong rallies. That said, on the hourly chart, it has taken the shape of a double top, a bearish reversal pattern identified by twin peaks separated by a valley (price drop). A move below $3.35 would trigger the double top breakdown, potentially opening the door for an extended pullback to $3.00. The Guppy multiple moving average (GMMA) indicator has already flipped bearish on the hourly chart, suggesting greater odds of a double top breakdown. On the higher side, a convincing move above $3.65 would signal the continuation of the bull run that has seen prices surge 54% to record highs this month. AI''s take: While XRP''s broader outlook remains constructive, the current double top and bearish hourly GMMA warrant caution. Resistance: $3.65, $4.00 Support: $3.35, $3.00, $2.65. Bitcoin: Triangular consolidation BTC continues to consolidate in a descending triangle, identified by a downward-sloping trendline connecting lower highs since July 14, and another trendline connecting the horizontal support at around $116,000. A move past the upper trendline would signal the end of the bull breather, potentially yielding a rally to record highs above $123,000. Conversely, a downside break would raise the risk of a deeper pullback, with major support seen directly at $111,965, the former record high from May. AI''s take: BTC is currently at a high-stakes inflection point, consolidating within a bearish descending triangle, making its immediate future direction highly contingent on a decisive break of key price levels. Resistance: $120,000, $123,181. Support: $116,000, $115,739, $111,965. Solana: Fades spike above $200 SOL has pulled back to $194 from the five-month high of $204 early today, printing a daily candle with a long upper wick, a sign of sellers looking to reassert themselves. Key momentum indicators, such as the hourly chart MACD, have flipped decisively bearish, suggesting scope for an extended decline toward the former resistance-turned-support level at $185. The broader outlook remains constructive, as prices remain above the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart and are locked in an ascending channel. AI''s take: The pullback from $204 with a long upper wick and bearish hourly MACD signals immediate selling pressure and the potential for a deeper short-term correction towards $185.

2025-07-22 09:00:00+00:00,Ethereum Rally Makes Eric Trump Look Like a Genius,"Trump specifically pointed out a 35% gain since his post and told followers to “embrace volatility.” Despite a steep drop after his endorsement, ETH has recovered and is now up around 12% year-to-date.Overall, Trump family crypto ventures—including $2 billion in BTC holdings by Trump Media and a $220M Bitcoin fund by Eric and Donald Jr.—have reportedly boosted Donald Trump’s fortune by over $620M. Ethereum also drew attention from Andrew Keys of The Ether Machine, who claimed ETH massively outperformed Bitcoin long-term. He also predicted a possible rise to $8,000 by 2026. Eric Trump Claps Back Eric Trump took to social media on Monday to celebrate Ethereum’s strong resurgence above the $3,800 mark. He also responded to critics who mocked his earlier support for the cryptocurrency. His comments were mainly directed at Ted Pillows, a partner at crypto exchange OKX, who ridiculed Trump in April after Ethereum experienced a steep drop in February and March. Quoting Pillows'' old post, Eric wrote, “How am I doing now @TedPillows?” and followed up with a confident message to another user , boasting a 35% gain in five months and encouraging them to “embrace volatility.” He also reiterated that smart investors would have bought the dips, just as he advised people to do at the time. Eric Trump’s claim isn’t without merit. ETH was trading around $2,877 on Feb. 4 when Trump publicly backed the asset. On Monday, however, ETH was sitting at $3,732, which is an unrealized gain of approximately 30% for those who followed his lead. On the other hand, it wasn’t a smooth ride. Ethereum plunged by almost 49% in the weeks after his post before recovering. Despite the ups and downs, Ethereum is now up roughly 12% year-to-date. Looking ahead, analyst Gert van Lagen sees more potential for Ethereum. He recently mentioned that ETH’s current market structure closely mirrors that of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1980. Based on this comparison, he forecasted a possible climb to $8,000 by early 2026. This could mean that the cryptocurrency may still be in the midst of a long-term bullish trend. The Trump family’s involvement in crypto goes far beyond tweets. Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the Truth Social platform, recently revealed it holds $2 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities. Meanwhile, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. are listed as founders of American Bitcoin, a company that raised $220 million from institutional investors to buy Bitcoin and mining equipment. TMTG press release All three Trump sons are also co-founders of World Liberty Financial, with President Donald Trump himself serving as co-founder emeritus. Altogether, these crypto-related ventures reportedly boosted Trump’s personal fortune by at least $620 million in just a few months. Ethereum Outshines Bitcoin? Andrew Keys , co-founder and chairman of Ethereum-focused investment firm The Ether Machine, also believes investors would have greatly outperformed Bitcoin holders if they invested in ETH over the past decade. On CNBC’s Squawk Box on Monday, Keys initially claimed Ethereum would have made investors 50 times wealthier than Bitcoin but later corrected the figure to 30 times in a follow-up post on X. His firm, The Ether Machine, plans to go public and is set to become the largest institutional Ethereum investment vehicle, launching with more than 400,000 ETH—currently valued at about $1.5 billion. This would surpass the ETH holdings of existing firms like Bitmine and SharpLink. Keys described himself as an “Ethereum guy” and admitted to not owning any Bitcoin. He even compared Bitcoin to a landline and Ethereum to an iPhone, due to his belief in Ethereum''s broader utility and innovation. He also argued that Ethereum is the primary beneficiary of the recently passed GENIUS Act, as the majority of stablecoins are deployed on the Ethereum network. He compared Ethereum’s dominance in tokenization to Google’s dominance in web search, as 90% of tokenized assets reside on Ethereum, just as Google handles 90% of internet searches. Despite Keys’ optimism and Ethereum’s impressive returns since its inception, some critics have pointed out that comparing Ethereum and Bitcoin on equal footing overlooks their different launch timelines. Bitcoin began trading in 2010 and gained over 234 million percent from its early days, while Ethereum launched in mid-2015 and has risen by more than 236,000%. Additionally, Ethereum is still down 24% from its all-time high in 2021, while Bitcoin recently hit a new peak in July. ETH’s all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) The Ether Machine is expected to go public via a merger with special purpose acquisition company Dynamix Corporation.

2025-07-22 09:00:25+00:00,These XRP Price Predictions Will Make You Think,"The past 24 hours saw the broader cryptocurrency market go through a slight correction, with the total capitalization dropping below $4 trillion. This comes on the back of a decline in Bitcoin’s price, which is down 1.3% during the period. As it’s almost always the case, altcoin performance is directly correlated with that of BTC but typically a lot more pronounced. That’s what we saw today as well. ETH dropped by 4.5%, DOGE – by 4.7%, ADA – by 4.6%, and XRP – by almost 4%. But as the native coin behind the XRPL corrects, analysts are taking the opportunity to present some price predictions. Technical XRP Price Predictions As CryptoPotato reported , prominent and popular analyst Ali Martinez shared a chart, indicating that XRP might be on its way to the $6 mark. To come to this price level, Martinez used Fibonacci levels drawn from the previous move. They indicat $4.17, $4.63, and $5.01 as points where the buyers might meet serious resistance. The final extension of his analysis indicates $6.12 as a target. Another trader, going by the CRYPTOWZRD moniker presented his technical outlook. Yesterday, he wrote: The intraday chart was somewhat volatile today and should remain so tomorrow. Our current position is secure. Moving above the $3.65 intraday resistance target will trigger the next long opportunity. $3.4 is the main intraday support target. We will have to wait for the market to form the next healthy trade setup. In the attached chart, the analyst presents $4.6 as the “next major target.” Source: X Somewhat in line with these was the comment of Cobb, who said that: XRP $5 is coming so fast. You will blink one day and it’s just gonna be $5 per coin.” What is Driving the Current Positive XRP Price Momentum? Regardless of the slight correction, the community is relatively unanimous – sentiment is positive. But what’s behind the recent price movements? Well, for once, the legal battle between the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs has more or less been resolved. The company has withdrawn its cross appeal and expects that SEC will do the same, effectively marking the end of the lawsuit. On the other hand, Ripple is a native US company and the country has done quite a bit under the presidency of Donald Trump with regards to crypto regulations. For instance, just recently, the administration passed the GENIUS Act, considered to be the first major national regulatory framework creating clearer rules for the growing industry, especially when it comes to stablecoins. Recall that Ripple also launched a USD-pegged coin called RLUSD and even tapped the country’s oldest bank – BNY Mellown to serve as a global partner and custodian. According to CoinGecko, RLUSD currenty has a market cap of around $530 million.

According to CoinGecko, RLUSD currenty has a market cap of around $530 million. The post These XRP Price Predictions Will Make You Think appeared first on CryptoPotato ."

The potential request was raised before Manhattan federal judge Katherine Polk Failla on Monday, questioning the validity of the testimony provided by government witness Hanfeng Lin, Inner City Press reported . If granted, a mistrial would render the current proceedings invalid, either dismissing the case or requiring a retrial with a new judge and jury. Storm was charged in 2023 with money laundering conspiracy, conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions, and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. He faces up to 45 years in prison. His co-founder, Roman Semenov, charged in the same case, remains in Russia and has not appeared in court. Disputed Testimony Over Crypto Scam Lin testified on Tuesday that she lost $190,000 in a crypto romance scam that began on WhatsApp in 2022. She described how a scammer convinced her to purchase Bitcoin and send it to a fraudulent trading platform that falsely displayed high returns, prompting her to send more funds. Eventually, the scammer disappeared with the funds. Lin said that Payback, a crypto recovery service she hired, informed her that some of her stolen Bitcoin had passed through Tornado Cash. However, Storm’s lawyer, David Patton, stated that their research over the weekend could not find any evidence linking Lin’s funds to Tornado Cash, indicating the defence would consider moving for a mistrial due to this testimony. Crypto Sleuths Challenge Connection to Tornado Cash FBI Special Agent Joseph DeCapua, a government crypto tracing expert, testified regarding the general flow of crypto from hacks into Tornado Cash but confirmed under cross-examination that he had not reviewed Lin’s transactions specifically. The prosecution indicated it would bring in IRS analyst Stephan George to prove Lin’s funds touched Tornado Cash. Meanwhile, independent blockchain researchers have cast doubt on Lin’s claims. MetaMask security researcher Taylor Monahan posted on X that her analysis showed the scammers who stole Lin’s funds did not use Tornado Cash. She explained that the scammers converted Lin’s Bitcoin to Ether, and the transactions were mistakenly flagged by Payback due to bundling errors onchain. Prominent blockchain investigator ZachXBT supported Monahan’s findings, criticising Payback’s tracing work, noting that the firm had followed incorrect transaction paths, leading to an inaccurate claim that Lin’s funds interacted with Tornado Cash.

We anticipate incremental and targeted easing measures in the second half of the year to alleviate labor market pressures.” Source: Bloomberg Ernan Cui, a China consumer analyst at the investment research firm Gavekal, says in a report reviewed by Bloomberg that Chinese workers are shifting toward self-employment because there are few available formal jobs in the country’s labor force. Cui also reportedly says that the Chinese government’s statistics bureau is counting those self-employed workers, but she notes that they may not be counted in surveys of large companies. “The data indicate that China’s labor market has been consistently weak, despite a broadly stable headline unemployment rate.

The fresh disclosure shows that the firm acquired over 4.4 million shares of Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), an Ethereum treasury firm. However, the purchase worth around $175 million was spread across three of ARK’s ETFs. This comes in when Ethereum is running high on bullish waves, gaining more than 25% in the last 7 days. This surge has pushed the largest altcoin to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the past 90 days. ETH went on to reclaim the crucial $3,800 mark long after December 2024. Cathie Wood goes long on Ethereum According to ARK Invest’s July 21 trade disclosure, the firm scooped 2.9 million shares of BMNR through its flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK). It added 927.8K shares via ARKW and 555.7K via ARKF. This can be seen as ARK’s first major move into Bitmine since the company announced it was turning away from Bitcoin and building a massive Ethereum treasury. Bitmine is now holding over $1 billion in ETH after a recent $500 million purchase. It reportedly plans to acquire and stake 5% of the total Ethereum supply. The ETH staking announcement led Bitmine stock to soar more than to an all-time high of $135 before cooling to around $39. It is still up by almost 800% over the past month. After-hours trading session shows that BMNR is expected to gain by 2% when the market opens. ARK’s move highlights a strong trend among institutional players and a shift from BTC to ETH amid rising momentum for ETH-based ETFs and treasury strategies. As of now, ARK’s Bitcoin ETF ARKB holds $5.81 billion of BTC. Source: ARK Invest Daily . Ethereum price recorded a minor correction of 4% on Tuesday morning after a brief rally. ETH is trading at an average price of $3,660 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume is down by 4.5% to stand at $44.5 billion. The digital assets market remained calm as it lost 2% of the gains over the last 24 hours. The cumulative crypto market cap stood at $3.89 trillion with a trading volume of $218 billion. Bitcoin price hovers around $117K-$118K. ARK ditches old favorites Cathie Wood’s ARK simultaneously sold 218,986 Coinbase shares (approx. worth $90 million) across three ETFs. It moved ahead to offload 463,293 shares of gaming firm Roblox (approx. worth $57.7 million). Meanwhile, it also made reductions in Robinhood and Block. While the ARKK fund remains heavily weighted toward tech names like Tesla (9.7% of the portfolio), Coinbase and Roblox are still its second and third largest holdings, with a 5% allocation to Circle. On July 15, ARK continued to build its Tesla position, purchasing 115,380 shares worth $36.5 million split across ARKK and ARKW.

Contributing to the discussion, crypto market analyst Ali Martinez, suggested in a July 22 post on X that the coin could be on track to surge even further.

If not, a pullback toward support at $115,000 is also likely. Is Ethereum $10,000 also possible? In another post , Martinez suggested Ethereum ( ETH ) could be poised for a major breakout toward $10,000 if it can decisively breach a critical resistance level around $4,000. Quote : “If Ethereum $ETH can break past $4,000, we could be looking at $10,000 next!” The analyst pointed to a long-standing Parallel Channel pattern on Ethereum’s weekly chart. Defined by two horizontal trendlines, the pattern has confined ETH’s price action in a sideways range for over two years.

2025-07-22 09:45:24+00:00,Hyperliquid Whale Makes Audacious $200M Bitcoin Bet,"BitcoinWorld Hyperliquid Whale Makes Audacious $200M Bitcoin Bet The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, often influenced by the seismic shifts of its largest players. Imagine a colossal ripple effect caused by a single, monumental trade. This is precisely what unfolded recently on Hyperliquid, a prominent decentralized exchange, as a formidable Hyperliquid whale made a breathtaking pivot, signaling a potentially significant shift in market sentiment. This dramatic move, from a substantial Ethereum (ETH) loss to an colossal Bitcoin (BTC) long position, has sent murmurs across the digital asset landscape, leaving many to ponder the implications of such an audacious bet. Understanding the Hyperliquid Whale’s Pivotal Move In the high-stakes world of crypto trading, every move by a ‘whale’ – an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency – is scrutinized. The recent actions of a particular Hyperliquid whale , identified by blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain as ‘AguilaTrades,’ have certainly captured the market’s attention. This whale’s journey highlights both the inherent risks and the immense potential rewards within the volatile crypto ecosystem. Initially, AguilaTrades was positioned with a substantial Ethereum long, a bet on ETH’s price appreciation. However, market dynamics proved challenging, leading to a significant setback: Ethereum Long Closure: The whale closed their ETH long position, incurring a loss estimated to be around $3 million. This substantial loss underscores the unpredictable nature of leveraged trading, even for seasoned participants. Strategic Capital Injection: Following the ETH loss, AguilaTrades swiftly deposited an additional 5.28 million USDC (USD Coin) to their Hyperliquid account. This immediate replenishment of capital signals strong conviction and readiness for the next strategic play, demonstrating deep pockets and a willingness to double down. This initial phase reveals a trader who is not deterred by losses but rather recalibrates and repositions with conviction, a hallmark often seen in professional trading circles. The ability to absorb a multi-million dollar loss and immediately inject fresh capital is a testament to the scale of operations this Hyperliquid whale commands. The Audacious Bitcoin Long Position: A Deeper Dive The subsequent action by the Hyperliquid whale was nothing short of monumental. After replenishing their capital, AguilaTrades pivoted sharply, shifting focus from Ethereum to Bitcoin with an aggressive, leveraged bet. This move was not just a change in asset; it was a dramatic increase in exposure and risk. Here’s a breakdown of this colossal Bitcoin trade: Asset Shift: From Ethereum to Bitcoin, signaling a potential belief in Bitcoin’s near-term strength or a hedge against broader market uncertainty. Leverage Applied: A staggering 20x leverage was used. This means that for every dollar of their own capital, the whale borrowed an additional nineteen dollars, amplifying both potential gains and potential losses twentyfold. Position Size: The long position was opened for 1,695 BTC, equivalent to approximately $200.5 million at the time of the trade. This makes it one of the largest single leveraged trades observed on Hyperliquid, showcasing the immense scale of this Hyperliquid whale’s conviction. Such a massive bet by a Hyperliquid whale often sends ripples through the market, influencing sentiment and potentially even triggering follow-on trades from other large players or algorithmic systems. It highlights the concentrated nature of wealth and influence within the crypto space, indicating strong conviction in Bitcoin’s immediate future. A significant move by a Hyperliquid whale. Decoding Whale Activity: Why It Matters Understanding the movements of a Hyperliquid whale is crucial for any participant in the crypto market, from seasoned traders to casual investors. Whales, by definition, hold enough assets to significantly influence market prices. Their trades, especially large leveraged positions, can act as leading indicators or, at times, self-fulfilling prophecies. Here’s why whale activity is so important: Market Impact: Large buy or sell orders can directly move prices, especially in less liquid assets. Even in highly liquid markets like Bitcoin, a $200 million position can create significant price pressure. Sentiment Indicator: Whale movements can signal underlying sentiment. A massive long position might suggest institutional optimism, while significant selling could indicate a bearish outlook. Liquidation Cascades: Highly leveraged positions, if they go wrong, can trigger cascading liquidations, exacerbating price swings. However, it’s vital to remember that not all whale movements are infallible. Whales can, and do, make mistakes, as evidenced by AguilaTrades’ $3 million ETH loss.

While your primary focus might be on Bitcoin or Ethereum, the traditional Forex Market Analysis , particularly of major pairs like EUR/USD, often provides a foundational understanding of global economic health and investor sentiment. This broader financial landscape can indirectly influence the liquidity and stability of the cryptocurrency space. Recently, ING, a prominent financial institution, highlighted a significant development concerning the EUR/USD pair: it lacks sufficient bullish momentum. What does this mean for the world’s most traded currency pair, and how might it impact your broader financial perspective? Decoding the Latest EUR/USD Forecast from ING ING’s recent assessment paints a cautious picture for the Euro against the US Dollar. The core of their argument revolves around a persistent lack of strong buying interest, suggesting that any upward movements are likely to be temporary and fragile. This outlook is not just a passing observation; it stems from a careful evaluation of various economic and policy indicators that continue to favor the US Dollar over the Euro. Economic Divergence: The US economy has shown remarkable resilience, often outperforming its European counterparts. Stronger labor markets and more robust consumer spending in the US create a more attractive environment for investment, drawing capital towards dollar-denominated assets. Interest Rate Differentials: Central bank policies play a pivotal role. While both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed) have grappled with inflation, the Fed’s stance on interest rates has often been perceived as more hawkish or adaptable, leading to higher yields on US bonds compared to Eurozone bonds. This yield differential makes the Dollar more appealing to investors seeking better returns. Geopolitical Risks: Ongoing geopolitical tensions, particularly in Europe, can weigh heavily on investor confidence in the Eurozone. Uncertainty often drives investors towards perceived safe-haven assets, and the US Dollar frequently benefits from this flight to safety. Forex Market Analysis : What’s Driving the Stagnation? Beyond ING’s specific points, a broader Forex Market Analysis reveals several systemic factors contributing to the EUR/USD’s struggle to find bullish momentum. These elements interact in complex ways, creating a challenging environment for the Euro. Inflation and Central Bank Policies Inflation remains a key determinant of central bank actions. In the Eurozone, while inflation has been a concern, the ECB has often adopted a more cautious approach to rate hikes compared to the Fed. This divergence in monetary policy philosophies directly impacts currency valuations. When a central bank signals a readiness to maintain higher rates for longer, its currency typically strengthens as it offers better returns for holding that currency. Consider the following comparison: Factor US Economy (USD) Eurozone Economy (EUR) Economic Growth Generally resilient, often outpacing Mixed, slower recovery in some areas Interest Rate Policy More aggressive/adaptive hikes More cautious/gradual hikes Inflation Trends Persistent, but showing signs of cooling Varied, but often stubborn in core components Labor Market Strong, low unemployment Varied, higher unemployment in some member states This table highlights the fundamental differences that can influence capital flows and, consequently, currency strength. Understanding the Euro Dollar Outlook : Key Levels and Resistance For traders and investors, understanding the technical landscape is as important as fundamental analysis. The current Euro Dollar Outlook suggests that key resistance levels are proving difficult for the pair to breach, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. These levels act as ceilings, where selling pressure tends to increase, preventing significant upward movement. Resistance Levels: Analysts often identify specific price points where the currency pair has struggled to advance in the past. Repeated failures to break above these levels signal a lack of buying conviction. For EUR/USD, these might be psychological levels like 1.0900 or 1.1000, or specific technical indicators. Support Levels: Conversely, support levels are price points where buying interest tends to emerge, preventing further declines. However, if these support levels are broken, it can signal a continuation of the bearish trend. Potential Scenarios: In a market lacking bullish momentum, common scenarios include consolidation (trading within a narrow range) or a gradual downtrend. Sharp upward moves are often quickly corrected, indicating that traders are quick to sell into strength.

2025-07-22 10:00:08+00:00,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Has Already Delivered 2× for Early Buyers, More Gains Coming","Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning heads in the crypto space with an impressive start for early investors. Those who jumped in during Phase 2 bought tokens at just $0.015, and the price has since doubled to $0.03. This early return has sparked growing excitement around the project as it moves forward, especially with 87% of Phase 5 tokens already sold. Backed by a strong CertiK audit scoring 95 on Token Scan and 77.5 on Skynet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining trust and momentum among investors looking for a reliable and scalable DeFi solution. Milestones Unfolding: From Smart Contracts to Beta Testing Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s journey is carefully mapped out, with each phase building on solid foundations. In Phase 2, the team focuses on developing the core smart contracts, front-end, and back-end infrastructure that will power the platform’s lending and borrowing features. These smart contracts are designed with security and efficiency in mind, ensuring smooth operation when the platform goes live. Looking ahead, Phase 3 will bring the much-anticipated beta launch. This testnet release will enable users to explore the platform’s features and provide valuable feedback through a structured bug reporting system. Alongside the beta, preparations for exchange listings are underway, which will boost liquidity and allow a broader range of investors to participate. These strategic milestones highlight Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s disciplined and transparent approach to development, laying the groundwork for sustained growth. A key differentiator in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s upcoming lending ecosystem is its planned dual model: P2C (Peer-to-Contract) and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) lending. In the future, a user lending $20,000 worth MATIC at a 65% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could receive $1,840 earning at an APY of 9.2%, automatically compounded on-chain. This would reward lenders with passive income while maintaining liquidity. On the borrowing side, high-risk memecoins like DOGE are expected to be accepted as collateral in the P2P model. A borrower putting up $100,000 worth of DOGE at a 30% LTV could access a $30,000 USDC loan, gaining quick liquidity without selling their tokens. This flexibility is designed to attract a wide user base, from cautious lenders to active traders. Layer 2 Scalability Unlocking DeFi’s True Potential One of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strongest advantages comes from its integration with Layer 2 solutions. By shifting operations to Layer 2, the platform reduces gas fees by a huge percentage, a significant improvement over traditional Layer 1 networks. This reduction in transaction costs removes a major barrier for smaller investors and frequent users, opening the door to more inclusive DeFi participation. Lower fees and faster transaction speeds will allow Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to handle larger volumes without congestion, improving the user experience and attracting more participants. This scalability advantage will be crucial as the platform prepares to launch its beta and mainnet, positioning it to compete with established DeFi protocols on both usability and efficiency. Community support plays a vital role in this growth story. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $100,000 giveaway program, rewarding ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, has energized the community and drawn in new supporters. With over 12,000 Twitter followers actively engaging with updates and discussions, the network effects are already driving token velocity and platform awareness. As the ecosystem expands, this strong community foundation will amplify Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s reach and adoption. Market analysts are starting to take notice as well. A renowned investor who accurately timed Bitcoin (BTC)’s surge to $120,000 is now forecasting that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will climb to $0.45 by mid-2026—which represents a 15x increase from the current Phase 5 presale price of $0.03. Real investor stories are already reflecting impressive gains. One early adopter allocated $3,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH) into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) during Phase 2, when tokens were priced at $0.015. At today’s presale rate of $0.03, their investment has already doubled, showing a 100% return even before the token lists publicly. Once MUTM reaches its listing price of $0.06, this investor could be looking at a 4x total return. And if the projected $0.45 target is achieved by mid-2026, their initial $3,000 could balloon to $90,000—a stunning 30x gain. With only 13% of Phase 5 tokens remaining, the urgency to buy in before the price climbs to $0.035 in the next phase is real. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s clear roadmap, strong audit credentials, and growing community all point to substantial upside ahead. For investors looking to ride a well-structured, milestone-driven DeFi launch, MUTM represents an opportunity too compelling to overlook.

2025-07-22 10:00:20+00:00,Unlocking the EUR/GBP Risk Premium: ING’s Crucial Insights for Astute Traders,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking the EUR/GBP Risk Premium: ING’s Crucial Insights for Astute Traders Even in the fast-paced world of digital assets, understanding the nuances of traditional financial markets, like the foreign exchange (forex) market, remains crucial. Just as Bitcoin and Ethereum react to global sentiment, major currency pairs like EUR/GBP are constantly influenced by economic forces. Recently, ING, a prominent financial institution, highlighted a significant development: markets are attaching a notable EUR/GBP risk premium . This phenomenon, while seemingly distant from your crypto portfolio, offers valuable insights into broader market sentiment, capital flows, and the underlying economic health of major global economies. Let’s delve into what this risk premium signifies, why it’s emerging, and what it could mean for the financial landscape. What is the EUR/GBP Risk Premium and Why Does it Matter? At its core, a risk premium is the additional return an investor demands for taking on a higher level of risk. In the context of currency pairs like EUR/GBP, it means that market participants are requiring more compensation to hold one currency over another, specifically the British Pound (GBP) over the Euro (EUR), due to perceived higher risks associated with the UK economy. When ING states that a risk premium is being attached to the EUR/GBP pair, it suggests that the market is pricing in a greater degree of uncertainty or potential downside for the Pound relative to the Euro. Why does this matter for anyone, even those primarily interested in crypto? Because currency movements are a fundamental barometer of a nation’s economic health and its attractiveness for investment. A rising risk premium on GBP indicates that global investors view the UK as a riskier place to invest or hold assets compared to the Eurozone. This can have far-reaching implications: Investment Flows: Higher risk might deter foreign direct investment into the UK, impacting economic growth. Trade Dynamics: A weaker Pound, driven by risk premium, can make UK exports cheaper but imports more expensive, affecting inflation and consumer purchasing power. Inflationary Pressures: If a weaker Pound pushes up import costs, it can exacerbate domestic inflation, creating a challenging environment for the Bank of England. Policy Decisions: Central banks closely monitor currency strength and risk premiums as they inform monetary policy decisions, such as interest rate adjustments. Broader Market Sentiment: The sentiment around major currency pairs often reflects global risk appetite. A significant risk premium on a G10 currency like GBP can signal underlying economic stress that could spill over into other asset classes. Understanding this premium is crucial for anyone seeking a holistic view of financial markets, as it provides a lens through which to interpret macro-economic trends and their potential impact on all asset classes, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. ING Market Insights : Decoding the Drivers ING’s analysis points to specific factors contributing to this elevated EUR/GBP risk premium . Their insights typically stem from a deep dive into macroeconomic data, central bank rhetoric, and geopolitical developments affecting both the UK and the Eurozone. While the exact details of ING’s latest report would provide precise figures, the general drivers for such a premium often include: Persistent UK Inflation: The UK has faced stubbornly high inflation, often outstripping that of the Eurozone. This puts the Bank of England (BoE) in a difficult position, balancing the need to tame inflation with concerns about economic growth. Higher, more persistent inflation can erode purchasing power and make a currency less attractive. Economic Growth Disparity: Concerns about the UK’s economic growth prospects, including the risk of recession, can weigh heavily on the Pound. If the Eurozone is perceived to have more resilient or stable growth, capital might flow from the UK to the Eurozone, demanding a premium for holding GBP. Monetary Policy Divergence: While both the BoE and the European Central Bank (ECB) have been tightening monetary policy, the market’s perception of their respective trajectories and effectiveness can create divergence. If the market believes the BoE might have to pause or reverse hikes sooner than the ECB, or if its actions are seen as less effective, it can weaken the Pound. Brexit’s Lingering Impact: The long-term economic consequences of Brexit, including trade barriers, labor shortages, and reduced foreign investment, continue to cast a shadow over the UK economy. These structural issues can contribute to a persistent risk premium. Geopolitical and Energy Shocks: Both regions are susceptible to global events, but their resilience and exposure can differ. For instance, the energy crisis affected both, but the UK’s unique energy market structure or trade relationships might make it more vulnerable in certain scena",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/eur-gbp-risk-premium-ing/,MARKET|FIAT|TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC,Forex News|Currency Trading|EURGBP|Forex|ING|Market Analysis,BTC,"Unlocking the EUR/GBP Risk Premium: ING’s Crucial Insights for Astute Traders.

2025-07-22 10:00:51+00:00,Analyst Says XRP Investors Are Getting Ripped Off — Here’s Why,"Over the last few weeks, XRP has creeped up slowly but surely to become one of the most talked-about cryptocurrencies in the space. Its price has also risen steadily through this time, beating the $3.6 level to reach new seven-year highs and triggering momentum for higher prices. While the community celebrates this milestone, there is the fact that the altcoin has not made a new all-time high, and even with all of the recent push, its inability to reach new peaks has become a cause for concern. Are XRP Investors Getting The Short End Of The Stick? In a TradingView post, crypto analyst ICharted made a shocking allegation, namely that XRP investors are being ripped off. The analyst pointed out that the fact that a number of bullish developments have emerged in recent times and the XRP price is still sitting well below its all-time high levels shows that investors were getting the short end of the stick. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whale Bets $21 Million After $2.14M Profit – What’s Going On? The analyst listed out seven developments that have been bullish for the XRP price and should’ve already pushed it to new peaks. First on the list is the election of US President Donald Trump, who is the first pro-crypto president in history. Despite the market surge triggered by Trump’s election, XRP has remained well below its all-time highs. Next on the list is the fact that the Ripple case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020 is nearing its end, and this has also triggered a surge. But it was still not enough for new peaks. This also comes amid mass adoption as Ripple becomes the foremost crypto settlement company in the industry. ICharted also pointed out the myriad of partnerships that Ripple has inked, spanning from payments to real estate, and yet the XRP price continues to struggle. This has put XRP in the eye of the public, making it a well-known cryptocurrency, especially as it plans to take on SWIFT, but it is still sitting below all-time highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Re-Enters Profit Zone As Greed Rises, But Rally To $200,000 Still Possible The rise in the volume in the past year is another development the analyst points to, as well as the fact that it was able to receive an ETF approval this year, which began trading last week. Then, last but not least, is the fact that the US Congress has passed multiple favourable crypto bills this year, and yet the XRP price remains below its 2018 peaks. Given that none of these have been able to push the XRP price to new all-time highs, the analyst warned investors that they are being ripped up on the price action. ICharted pointed to a possible price crash back to the $2 level soon, predicting that a free fall will begin in August. “The Feds are soon going to cut rates multiple times. Bitcoin tanks everytime that happens,” the analyst warned.

Given that none of these have been able to push the XRP price to new all-time highs, the analyst warned investors that they are being ripped up on the price action. ICharted pointed to a possible price crash back to the $2 level soon, predicting that a free fall will begin in August. “The Feds are soon going to cut rates multiple times. Bitcoin tanks everytime that happens,” the analyst warned. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

The move would represent a sharp reversal for CEO Jamie Dimon, who infamously called Bitcoin a “fraud” in 2017 and claimed it was only useful to “drug dealers and murderers.” According to people familiar with the matter, JPMorgan could begin offering crypto-collateralized loans as early as next year, although the plans remain subject to change. The bank declined to comment. Dimon softens crypto stance as JPMorgan expands push into digital assets If the initiative is implemented, it would allow clients to borrow against assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum—marking the clearest indication yet that Wall Street giants are integrating cryptocurrencies into their core services. It would also put JPMorgan ahead of competitors like Goldman Sachs , which has yet to accept crypto as collateral. In recent years, Dimon has tempered his stance. “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy Bitcoin. Go at it,” he said in May. His earlier comments, which included threats to fire traders who dabbled in crypto, reportedly alienated potential clients who had built wealth through digital assets or held strong convictions in the sector’s long-term potential. JPMorgan has already dipped into crypto through plans to lend against holdings in crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). However, lending against the digital tokens themselves would be a significant leap, especially as regulatory sentiment in Washington shifts. Stablecoin legislation spurs Wall Street interest The House of Representatives recently passed the first major crypto legislation to regulate stablecoins —digital tokens pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar—which large banks have welcomed as a gateway to easier digital asset operations. Other firms are following suit. Morgan Stanley is weighing crypto trading options via its E*Trade platform, and broader institutional interest has picked up amid expectations that a second Trump administration could bring looser oversight than President Biden’s policies. Still, hurdles remain. A key concern for banks is managing money laundering risks and compliance obligations tied to cryptocurrencies. Additionally, JPMorgan must address technical challenges, such as managing seized collateral in case of loan defaults. Unlike most major banks, JPMorgan does not hold crypto directly on its balance sheet. Instead, it would likely work with a third-party custodian, such as Coinbase, to manage the assets. Still, hurdles remain. One of the biggest worries for banks is managing the risk of money laundering and the regulatory requirements associated with cryptocurrencies. And JPMorgan has to grapple with technological hurdles, like how to handle collateral confiscated from borrowers that fail to pay back their loans. In contrast to many other big banks, JPMorgan doesn’t keep crypto directly on its balance sheet. Instead, it would presumably use a third-party custodian, like Coinbase, to store the assets. Despite its cautious approach to mainstream cryptocurrencies, JPMorgan has long been active in the broader digital asset space. In 2019, it launched JPM Coin —the first digital token issued by a US bank, to streamline wholesale payments between institutional clients. Dimon recently said the bank plans to expand its role in stablecoins, including its own JPMorgan Deposit coin, although he has been skeptical of their advantages over traditional payment channels.

2025-07-22 10:10:19+00:00,Figma IPO: Unveiling a Billion-Dollar Crypto-Friendly Future,"BitcoinWorld Figma IPO: Unveiling a Billion-Dollar Crypto-Friendly Future Are you ready for a fascinating convergence of cutting-edge design and the dynamic world of digital assets? The buzz around the Figma IPO is reaching a fever pitch, and it’s not just about a design software giant going public. This initial public offering holds a surprising twist that will undoubtedly pique the interest of anyone watching the cryptocurrency space. Figma, a company synonymous with collaborative design, is not only targeting a massive valuation but is also making significant moves into crypto, signaling a potentially transformative shift for the tech industry. Figma IPO: A Blockbuster Debut on the Horizon? The highly anticipated Figma IPO is set to make waves on the New York Stock Exchange. According to reports from the Financial Times, the design software powerhouse plans to raise a substantial sum, aiming for up to $1 billion. This ambitious target would catapult the company’s valuation to an impressive $16.5 billion, a figure that underscores its dominance in the design software market. For those keeping an eye on market trends, the specifics of the Figma IPO are compelling: Shares Offered: Nearly 40 million shares are expected to be made available to the public. Price Range: Each share is anticipated to be priced between $25 and $28. Target Valuation: A staggering $16.5 billion, reflecting investor confidence in Figma’s growth trajectory and market position. Capital Raise: Up to $1 billion, which will provide significant capital for future expansion, innovation, and strategic initiatives. Backed by some of the most prominent venture capital firms, Figma has demonstrated robust financial health. In the first quarter, the company reported an impressive $228 million in revenue and a healthy $45 million in net income. While the previous year saw a $732 million loss, this was largely attributed to a stock tender offer, a common financial maneuver, rather than operational deficiencies. This strong Q1 performance paints a positive picture for the impending Figma IPO , indicating a company with solid fundamentals and a clear path to profitability. The Adobe Saga: Paving the Way for Figma’s Independence The journey to the Figma IPO has been particularly eventful, marked by a significant turning point involving Adobe. For those unfamiliar, Adobe, another titan in the creative software industry, had previously attempted a colossal $20 billion takeover of Figma. This acquisition would have reshaped the design software landscape entirely, consolidating immense power under one roof. However, regulatory bodies stepped in, ultimately blocking the proposed acquisition due to antitrust concerns. This intervention, while initially a setback for Adobe, proved to be a pivotal moment for Figma. It essentially cleared the path for Figma to pursue its independent future, culminating in the current plans for the Figma IPO . This regulatory decision underscored Figma’s critical role in the market and its potential to thrive as a standalone entity, free from the constraints of a larger corporate structure. It also highlighted the growing scrutiny over tech mega-mergers, reinforcing the idea that innovation and competition are best served by a diverse ecosystem of players. Beyond the Figma IPO: Why Crypto Investments Matter Now, here’s where the story takes an intriguing turn, especially for our audience passionate about digital assets. Beyond the impressive financial figures and market valuations, the Figma IPO prospectus reveals a strategic move that sets it apart from many traditional tech companies: its foray into cryptocurrency investments. Figma currently holds a notable $70 million in a Bitcoin ETF. This isn’t just a casual investment; it’s a significant commitment that signals a broader embrace of digital assets within the company’s financial strategy. Why would a design software company like Figma invest in a Bitcoin ETF? There are several compelling reasons: Diversification: Like any savvy investor, companies seek to diversify their portfolios to mitigate risks and enhance returns. Bitcoin, despite its volatility, has shown potential as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Strategic Foresight: Figma recognizes the growing importance and legitimacy of the digital asset space. Investing now could position them favorably for future developments in Web3 and blockchain technology. Innovation Alignment: As a company at the forefront of digital design, investing in cutting-edge financial technologies aligns with Figma’s innovative ethos. Future Growth: Holding crypto assets could be seen as a long-term growth play, leveraging the potential appreciation of digital currencies. Furthermore, Figma’s plans extend beyond just holding a Bitcoin ETF. The company has explicitly stated its intention to make more crypto investments in the future.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase has launched CFTC-regulated nano BTC and ETH perpetual futures. The new products offer up to 10x leverage for US retail traders. Coinbase plans to expand its product lineup, targeting more cryptocurrencies. The launch introduces nano Bitcoin (BTC-PERP) and nano Ether (ETH-PERP) contracts through Coinbase Financial Markets, allowing leverage of up to 10x with taker fees starting at 0.02%, the exchange said in a Monday announcement . Perpetual contracts, derivatives with no expiry date, have traditionally made up the lion’s share of global crypto derivatives volume. US Traders Exit Shadows as Regulated Futures Arrive U.S. traders were long sidelined by regulatory barriers, pushing many toward unregulated offshore platforms, often at the expense of transparency and legal risk. Coinbase’s move changes that narrative, bringing these instruments within a federally regulated framework overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The contracts are structured to mimic traditional perpetuals while maintaining regulatory compliance, with five-year expirations and hourly funding rates to balance long and short positions. Settlements are conducted in USD, and trading is available 24/7, an industry standard in crypto that aligns with the global nature of digital assets. Coinbase’s rollout comes amid a broader push by U.S.-based exchanges to reclaim market share from overseas rivals. The firm recently acquired Deribit for $2.9 billion, positioning itself as a serious player in crypto derivatives. Kraken has also quietly launched its own CFTC-compliant perps via Kraken Pro, reflecting renewed domestic interest in regulated access to leverage products. Beyond BTC and ETH, Coinbase hinted at future listings tied to other major cryptocurrencies, including Solana and XRP, as it builds out a more comprehensive offering. The wait is over – Perpetual futures have arrived in the U.S. → No monthly expirations → Trade with up to 10x leverage → Fees as low as 0.02% Now you can trade perpetual-style futures on Coinbase Financial Markets, a secure and CFTC-regulated platform. pic.twitter.com/627ZOPTTzG — Coinbase Futures (@cbFutures) July 21, 2025 The company also offers 20x leverage for precious metals like silver and gold, appealing to traders seeking broader exposure across asset classes. “U.S. traders can now access enhanced capital efficiency and amplify their market positions within a secure, regulated framework,” the exchange said. Coinbase Named TIME ‘Disruptor’ As reported, TIME has recognized Coinbase as one of 2025’s 100 Most Influential Companies , labeling the crypto exchange a “disruptor” for its significant role in shaping US digital asset policies and markets. The accolade highlights Coinbase’s aggressive advocacy in Washington and its expanding influence in the crypto sector. Coinbase’s stock has surged 42% year-to-date, climbing from around $303 to a high near $382. The rise comes amid the passage of the GENIUS stablecoin bill and Coinbase’s historic inclusion in the S&P 500 in May . TIME noted the exchange as a key driver behind the industry’s policy efforts and predicted Coinbase could become the central hub for crypto trading in the US. Beyond the US, Coinbase is broadening its reach in Europe, securing a license under the EU’s MiCA regulatory framework through Luxembourg’s financial regulator.

In an X post, Solana Venture stated it is “ not affiliated or involved with any equity line of credit agreements with any publicly listed companies. “ Solana Ventures is not affiliated or involved with any equity line of credit agreements with any publicly listed companies or entities. — Solana Ventures (@SolanaVentures) July 21, 2025 Mercurity claimed the funding would support SOL accumulation, staking operations, validator nodes, and investments in Solana-based projects, including real-world assets and tokenized finance products. Solana Ventures or Another Company With The Same Name? Despite Solana Ventures’ swift denial, Mercurity Fintech hasn’t taken down their posts or provided any clarity on it. However, according to WuBlockchain, the company stated in its press release is not the renowned Solana Ventures but another company that simply uses a similar name. Solana Ventures said it has not signed or participated in any equity credit line agreements with any public company or institution. The company in the press release simply uses a similar name. — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 22, 2025 The incident comes as legitimate Solana treasury companies have driven significant market interest, with DeFi Development Corp. reaching 999,999 SOL holdings worth $181 million. The dispute occurs amid a broader corporate rush into Solana treasuries, with BIT Mining planning to raise $200-300 million for SOL accumulation and multiple companies pivoting from Bitcoin to alternative cryptocurrencies. Legitimate Solana Treasury Companies Drive Market Momentum DeFi Development Corp. has emerged as the leading Solana treasury company, purchasing 141,383 SOL between July 14 and 20 at an average price of $133.53 , for approximately $19 million. The Florida-based firm now holds 999,999 SOL and SOL equivalents, just one token short of its symbolic 1 million milestone. The company’s SOL-per-share ratio reached 0.0514, representing a 13% increase from the previous week as it targets 1 SPS by December 2028. DeFi Development has drawn only 0.4% of its $5 billion equity line of credit, raising $19.2 million with $5 million in proceeds remaining for future purchases. Similarly, BIT Mining announced plans to raise $200-300 million for Solana treasury conversion , marking a departure from its previous focus on mining Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic. The company’s stock surged over 300% in pre-market trading following the announcement of its pivot to the Solana ecosystem. Moreover, Canadian firm Sol Strategies holds over 420,000 SOL tokens and filed for a Nasdaq listing under ticker “STKE” as part of U.S. expansion plans. The company secured a $500 million convertible note facility earmarked for acquiring and staking additional SOL tokens. NextGen Digital Platforms has also purchased $1 million worth of Bitcoin as its first crypto acquisition, with board approval for up to 80% treasury allocation to digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The diversified approach shows a trend where corporate acceptance of multiple cryptocurrency treasuries is increasing. However, it is worth noting that altcoins carry heightened risks due to volatility, lower liquidity, and experimental technology compared to Bitcoin.

Nasdaq-listed Mercurity Fintech announced a $200 million Equity Line of Credit Agreement with Solana Ventures to launch a Solana-based treasury strategy, but Solana Ventures immediately denied any involvement. In an X post, Solana Venture stated it is “ not affiliated or involved with any equity line of credit agreements with any publicly listed companies. “ Solana Ventures is not affiliated or involved with any equity line of credit agreements with any publicly listed companies or entities. — Solana Ventures (@SolanaVentures) July 21, 2025 Mercurity claimed the funding would support SOL accumulation, staking operations, validator nodes, and investments in Solana-based projects, including real-world assets and tokenized finance products. Solana Ventures or Another Company With The Same Name? Despite Solana Ventures’ swift denial, Mercurity Fintech hasn’t taken down their posts or provided any clarity on it. However, according to WuBlockchain, the company stated in its press release is not the renowned Solana Ventures but another company that simply uses a similar name. Solana Ventures said it has not signed or participated in any equity credit line agreements with any public company or institution. The company in the press release simply uses a similar name. — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 22, 2025 The incident comes as legitimate Solana treasury companies have driven significant market interest, with DeFi Development Corp. reaching 999,999 SOL holdings worth $181 million. The dispute occurs amid a broader corporate rush into Solana treasuries, with BIT Mining planning to raise $200-300 million for SOL accumulation and multiple companies pivoting from Bitcoin to alternative cryptocurrencies. Legitimate Solana Treasury Companies Drive Market Momentum DeFi Development Corp. has emerged as the leading Solana treasury company, purchasing 141,383 SOL between July 14 and 20 at an average price of $133.53 , for approximately $19 million. The Florida-based firm now holds 999,999 SOL and SOL equivalents, just one token short of its symbolic 1 million milestone. The company’s SOL-per-share ratio reached 0.0514, representing a 13% increase from the previous week as it targets 1 SPS by December 2028. DeFi Development has drawn only 0.4% of its $5 billion equity line of credit, raising $19.2 million with $5 million in proceeds remaining for future purchases. Similarly, BIT Mining announced plans to raise $200-300 million for Solana treasury conversion , marking a departure from its previous focus on mining Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, and Ethereum Classic. The company’s stock surged over 300% in pre-market trading following the announcement of its pivot to the Solana ecosystem. Moreover, Canadian firm Sol Strategies holds over 420,000 SOL tokens and filed for a Nasdaq listing under ticker “STKE” as part of U.S. expansion plans. The company secured a $500 million convertible note facility earmarked for acquiring and staking additional SOL tokens. NextGen Digital Platforms has also purchased $1 million worth of Bitcoin as its first crypto acquisition, with board approval for up to 80% treasury allocation to digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The diversified approach shows a trend where corporate acceptance of multiple cryptocurrency treasuries is increasing. However, it is worth noting that altcoins carry heightened risks due to volatility, lower liquidity, and experimental technology compared to Bitcoin.

2025-07-22 10:19:08+00:00,Bit Origin Buys 40.5M Dogecoin in First Crypto Treasury Move,"China-based pork processor turned Bitcoin miner Bit Origin has officially launched its crypto treasury strategy by purchasing 40.5 million Dogecoin, marking a significant pivot in its evolving business direction. The company announced the acquisition on Monday, describing it as its “first strategic acquisition” under its digital asset treasury initiative, funded through a share sale and debt offering aiming to raise $500 million. At an average purchase price of $0.24 per Dogecoin, Bit Origin spent nearly $9.9 million on the buy, with the top memecoin now trading at $0.26, according to CoinMarketCap. The move comes amid Bit Origin’s efforts to expand its presence in the crypto ecosystem beyond mining infrastructure, aiming to directly engage with the value and utility of digital assets. From Pork to Crypto Bit Origin, initially launched in 2019 as China Xiangtai Food, was previously focused on pork processing, including slaughtering, packing, and wholesale distribution. In December 2021, the company shifted direction by acquiring 742 spot first-tier Bitcoin miners, eventually rebranding as Bit Origin in 2022 to reflect its crypto focus. In 2022, Bit Origin joined hands with MineOne Partners Limited to operate a mining facility in Cheyenne, Wyoming, providing operational and strategic support. However, in 2024, the China-linked mining firm was forced to vacate the property after an order from the White House due to its proximity to a nuclear missile base. Bit Origin’s CEO, Jinghai Jiang, who joined in 2021, previously served as a director at MineOne Partners, deepening the operational ties between the firms. Now, in 2025, Bit Origin’s company profile no longer references pork processing, reflecting its full commitment to the crypto sector. The Strategic Role of Dogecoin Dogecoin, created in 2013 as a lighthearted payment system by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, has evolved to become the eighth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Bit Origin’s CEO Jiang stated that the decision to adopt Dogecoin for its treasury was due to the token nearing an “inflection point” for micropayments. This is driven by renewed developer interest and broader institutional momentum toward tokenization . “While we embrace Dogecoin’s cultural origins, which have driven liquidity and familiarity, we believe the current market environment aligns with meme coin’s evolution toward decentralized finance,” Jiang said. Bit Origin recently entered agreements to sell up to $400 million in shares and $100 million in convertible debt to fund its Dogecoin treasury initiative . This move also positions Bit Origin within a shifting crypto landscape where major memecoin holders include wallets linked to Robinhood and Binance.

2025-07-22 10:30:07+00:00,Trump Media Announces Bitcoin Treasury Holdings Reached $2 Billion – Details,"US President Donald Trump’s social media company, Trump Media, has revealed its multi-billion Bitcoin (BTC) holdings as part of its crypto treasury strategy. The news follows the President’s recent post praising the flagship cryptocurrency. Trump Media Continues Bitcoin Treasury Strategy On Monday, Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) announced that the company has accumulated approximately $2 billion worth of Bitcoin and BTC-related securities for its BTC treasury strategy. The company, which operates the social media platform Truth Social, the streaming platform Truth+, and the FinTech brand Truth.Fi, revealed that its Bitcoin Treasury holdings account for two-thirds of its nearly $3 billion in liquid assets. Trump Media stated that it has also allocated around $300 million for purchasing options tied to BTC-related securities, but did not offer a breakdown of the $2 billion holdings. Additionally, it shared its plans to continue buying Bitcoin and BTC-related assets, and convert its options into spot Bitcoin, depending on market conditions, to “generate revenues and potentially acquire additional crypto assets.” Trump Media’s CEO and President Devin Nunes said, “We’re rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan.” He reaffirmed that the company’s strategy helps ensure its financial freedom and protect it “against discrimination by financial institutions and will create synergies with the utility token we’re planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere.” In May, Trump Media announced its plan to invest in the flagship crypto as part of its BTC strategy. As reported by Bitcoinist, the company secured commitments from approximately 50 investors to raise $2.5 billion with the sale of common stock and convertible notes. At the time, Nunes described the BTC investment as a pivotal step in defending the company, affirming, “We view Bitcoin as an apex instrument of financial freedom, and now Trump Media will hold cryptocurrency as a crucial part of our assets.” US Continues Crypto Regulation Trump Media announcement follows President Trump’s recent Truth Social post praising the flagship crypto to conclude the historic “Crypto Week,” which saw the highly anticipated GENIUS Act being signed into law on Friday. On Sunday, the US president shared Coin Center research director Peter Van Valkenburgh’s 2018 testimony during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, calling it the “greatest Bitcoin explanation of all time.” Van Valkenburgh argued that BTC and Blockchain technology are transforming global finance as “the world’s first public digital payments infrastructure.” During the 2018 hearing, he explained that: Bitcoin’s not the best money on every margin. It’s not yet accepted everywhere. It’s not used often to quote prices, and it’s not always a stable store of value. But it is working, and the mere fact that it works without trusted intermediaries is amazing. It’s a computer science breakthrough, and it will be as significant for freedom, prosperity, and human flourishing as the birth of the internet. Moreover, the White House is set to release its first crypto policy report on Tuesday, which is expected to include an official inventory of the US federal BTC holdings. For context, President Trump signed an executive order on January 23 mandating that the Digital Assets Working Group submit a report within 180 days of the order’s date.

The lawsuit was initiated in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and the allegations range from suspected fraudulent activities to misconduct. Mewawalla denies wrongdoing, points to earlier achievements The dismissal of Rahul Mewawalla comes as a surprise to many as it is happening months after Mawson awarded him $2.5 million in cash bonuses, 1.2 million restricted stock units, and a base salary increase to $1.2 million, a reward for what it called “high-performing” executive performance. On May 30, the company notified Mewawalla that his termination for “Cause,” as defined in his employment agreement, was under consideration and days down the line, the board put him on administrative leave, tapping General Counsel Kaliste Saloom to be interim CEO. By July 8, the decision had been made; his board seat was revoked and the lawsuit, which accused him of fraud and fiduciary breaches, was filed in Delaware’s Court of Chancery seeking to recover damages. Mewawalla is yet to comment on or respond to Mawson’s accusations. However, in a July 17 letter to the board, he “respectfully and vigorously” disagreed with the company’s version of events while highlighting the board’s own public praise of his leadership earlier this year. He mentioned how in recent public filings, the company highlighted “numerous strategic, operational, and financial milestones achieved” while he was CEO, including 36% revenue growth, a 35% jump in gross profit, and reductions in SG&A expenses. Mawson made headlines for being sued months ago The dispute between Mawson and its CEO is happening months after the company got sued by NYDIG’s parent company, Stone Ridge and its mining subsidiary, Consensus Colocation, accusing it of allegedly illegally obtaining over 20,000 ASIC miners valued at $30 million and using them to mine Bitcoin for itself since February 28, 2025. Consensus and Mawson had a colocation agreement established in December 2023, with plans to terminate by March 2025. However, there were disputes over colocation fees and access to miners . Mawson issued invoices totaling $1,978,000 for colocation fees and electricity, which Stone Ridge disputed, claiming there was a mutual agreement that there would be less energy used during the final month of the contract. Mawson went as far as changing the payout address for the miners and revoking access for Consensus personnel, an action it justified by citing a provision in their agreement that Stone Ridge argues does not apply. The company filed the lawsuit to seek an injunction that would restore the hosting agreement and has demanded that Mawson reinstate access to the miners as part of the removal process.

2025-07-22 10:52:25+00:00,Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? Bitcoin Price Drops To $117K,"The post Why Crypto Market Is Down Today? Bitcoin Price Drops To $117K appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market took a sharp hit today , with most major tokens posting heavy losses. Bitcoin fell below $117,000, Ethereum plunged by 25.17% to $3,650, and other altcoins like Solana and XRP followed the same trend. The sell-off came after a surprise $130 million outflow from Bitcoin ETFs , breaking a 12-day streak of steady inflows. With prices hitting recent highs, some traders also locked in profits, adding to the pressure. Another factor weighing on sentiment is the upcoming speech by Fed Chair Jerome Powell , which could influence the outlook on interest rates. Many investors are holding back until they hear what Powell has to say. Not Overheated Yet: Market Still Has Room to Breathe While prices are falling, things aren’t looking disastrous. According to on-chain data, the market isn’t in panic mode. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr notes that Bitcoin is still trading within what he calls the “growth zone.” This is the range between the Investor Price Median at $92,000 and the Hype Alert Threshold at $139,000. “We’re not in the danger zone of excessive speculation,” Adler said on X. In simpler terms, this means people are still holding or gradually buying, not chasing wild gains or panic selling. That’s usually a good sign for market stability. The Advanced Sentiment Index is sitting at around 64%, which shows a positive outlook, but not overconfidence. If Bitcoin can stay above the $92,000 mark, it’s likely to keep support from long-term holders. This creates a strong base, even if prices remain volatile in the short term. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top Seven Altcoins To Buy Now For Big Gains , What to Watch Next With Powell’s Tuesday speech coming up, all eyes are on what the Fed will signal next.

2025-07-22 10:54:09+00:00,Interest in Ethereum Grows in Traditional Finance! Ethereum ETF Sees Highest Weekly Inflow in History! Here Are the Details,"The traditional financial world is witnessing record-breaking interest in Ethereum. Ethereum spot ETFs attracted approximately $2.18 billion in investment over the past week, with net inflows of 677,000 ETH. This represents the highest weekly inflow in Ethereum ETF history. Ethereum Spot ETFs Break Record: Weekly Inflows $2.18 Billion, ETHA Tops Volume Thanks to these massive inflows, the total on-chain holdings of Ethereum ETFs, measured by known on-chain addresses, reached an all-time high of 5.15 million ETH. During the same period, trading volume for Ethereum ETFs also exploded. Total weekly volume reached $10.5 billion, representing an average daily trading volume of $2.1 billion. Nearly 70% of this volume, and over 80% of all net inflows, occurred through the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHA). Driven by the sharp rise in ETH prices, the asset value of spot Ethereum ETFs under management reached over $15.5 billion, setting a new record. ETH surged 27% in the past week and 52% in July. Institutional Ethereum Purchases Support Rally The ETH rally is driven not only by ETF demand but also by institutional treasury purchases. Sharplink Gaming (SBET) stands out in particular. Over the past nine days, the company has aggressively purchased ETH, reaching 280,706 (~$840 million), surpassing the Ethereum Foundation to become the largest institutional holder of ETH. SBET financed these acquisitions with a $1 billion stock issuance program announced in May. On July 17, the company applied to increase this program to $6 billion and announced that these funds would be used to purchase new ETH. Shareholders will evaluate this plan in a vote on July 24. Other Companies Are Also Building ETH Treasuries Apart from SBET, BitMine Immersion (BMNR) and Bit Digital (BTBT) are also implementing similar strategies. BMNR raised $250 million in funding at the end of June and held a position of 163,000 ETH. BTBT announced that it has received over 100,000 ETH following a $172 million funding round and Bitcoin sale. This strong institutional demand for Ethereum ETFs isn''t just about price appreciation; it''s also further solidifying ETH''s place in the financial system. With ETF records, institutional ETH treasuries, and increasing investment volume, Ethereum is solidifying its position as a store of value and high-yield asset in the eyes of investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-22 10:55:23+00:00,Unveiling the Power: MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy Poised for 900K BTC by 2027,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Power: MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy Poised for 900K BTC by 2027 In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, few companies spark as much debate and fascination as MicroStrategy, especially concerning its aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy. While some critics label its valuation as a ‘bubble,’ a leading U.S. investment bank, TD Cowen, has stepped forward to robustly defend the company’s approach. They argue that valuing MicroStrategy solely on its Bitcoin holdings is a flawed perspective. This article delves into why TD Cowen maintains its bullish stance, projecting a staggering 900,000 BTC for MicroStrategy by 2027. If you’ve ever wondered about the true drivers behind MicroStrategy’s market premium and its ambitious future, you’re in the right place to understand the nuances of the MicroStrategy Bitcoin narrative. Why is MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy Drawing Such Intense Attention? MicroStrategy has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption, holding a significant portion of the world’s largest cryptocurrency on its balance sheet. This unique strategy has naturally led to scrutiny, with many questioning whether its market capitalization, which often trades at a substantial premium to its underlying Bitcoin assets, is truly justified. Currently, MicroStrategy’s market cap stands at an impressive $124.3 billion, reflecting a 72.6% premium over its $72 billion in Bitcoin holdings. TD Cowen’s defense cuts through the noise, asserting that this premium is not only warranted but is a testament to MicroStrategy’s strategic brilliance. They emphasize that the argument of pricing the company solely by its Bitcoin holdings overlooks critical factors that contribute to its value. Here’s why TD Cowen believes the MicroStrategy Bitcoin premium is valid: Ability to Raise Cheap Capital: MicroStrategy has demonstrated an unparalleled knack for raising substantial capital through various means, such as convertible notes and equity offerings. This capital is then strategically deployed to acquire more Bitcoin. Unlike traditional companies that raise capital for operational expenses or expansion into new markets, MicroStrategy primarily uses it to accumulate a rapidly appreciating digital asset. Growth in Bitcoin Per Share: A key metric highlighted by TD Cowen is MicroStrategy’s ability to consistently grow its Bitcoin per share. This means that existing shareholders benefit from the company’s capital-raising activities, as the newly acquired Bitcoin increases the overall BTC exposure for each share owned. Pioneering Institutional Adoption: MicroStrategy isn’t just buying Bitcoin; it’s actively shaping the narrative around institutional digital asset adoption. Its bold moves provide a blueprint and confidence for other corporations considering similar strategies. These factors, according to TD Cowen, transform MicroStrategy from a mere Bitcoin proxy into a sophisticated financial entity with a unique capital allocation strategy centered around Bitcoin. Decoding the MicroStrategy Bitcoin Premium: More Than Just HODLing? The concept of a premium might seem perplexing at first glance. If a company holds $100 worth of an asset, why would its market value be $170? For MicroStrategy Bitcoin , this premium reflects investor confidence in its management’s ability to execute its unique strategy and continue accumulating Bitcoin efficiently. It’s a testament to the market’s belief that MicroStrategy can generate more value than simply holding Bitcoin directly. Let’s look at a concrete example: MicroStrategy recently raised a significant $740 million. This capital wasn’t used for traditional business operations; instead, it was strategically deployed to add over 6,200 Bitcoins to its already substantial holdings. What’s even more impressive is the impact this had on the company’s Bitcoin per share metric, which saw a remarkable 20.8% increase this year. This growth indicates that MicroStrategy is effectively leveraging its capital structure to enhance shareholder exposure to Bitcoin. To further illustrate MicroStrategy’s unique financial engineering, consider the following breakdown: Metric Value Significance in MicroStrategy Bitcoin Strategy Current Market Capitalization $124.3 Billion Reflects investor belief in future growth and strategic value beyond just BTC holdings. Value of Bitcoin Holdings $72 Billion The foundational asset base that drives much of the company’s valuation.

2025-07-22 11:02:23+00:00,Bitcoin (BTC) Breakout Alert: Stay Patient for the Big Surge!,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been hovering above and below $118,000 for more than a week now. The price is also traversing inside a triangle, and is coming near to a breakout point. Could there be a surge to $130,000 and beyond, or are we in for a dip, followed by more sideways choppiness? Triangle breakout imminent Source: TradingView The latest series of sideways movement after the last surge up from $112,000 possibly won’t last as long as previous consolidation periods. This is because this continuation pattern is a much smaller triangle. Of course, the $BTC price could exit the triangle and then still keep trending sideways, perhaps printing a different, and bigger chart pattern. That said, it does rather look as though a breakout is about to take place. It’s customary for Bitcoin to hardly ever get to the ends of triangles, and it''s much more usual for a breakout to occur not more than around three quarters of the way through the pattern. The price is at this point now, so it just may be a matter of time before the bulls ignite the thrusters and the rocket ship takes off again. The $119,000 resistance is the first target, then a higher high above $119,640, and finally a take out of the $121,000 high before the final ascent to the all-time high at $123,200. If however the bears are able to take control, just under $116,000 would be the last line in the sand before a potential rapid collapse to $112,000. Going below $109,000 would be cause for major concern. Strong support structure below Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that if the price can get above $119,000 we could be back to smooth sailing and another leg higher, perhaps to $130,000. If on the other hand the price does fall back down, decent price structure, formed by the tops of the falling wedge and the bull flag, would probably act as strong support, and a bounce would be likely to occur from there. RSI trend break on 2-week chart Source: TradingView It’s the 2-week chart that holds a big clue as to where the $BTC price is going next. At the bottom of the chart is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which signals overbought and oversold conditions. It can be seen in the chart that the indicator has just popped its head above the downtrend line. There is still the best part of two weeks before this can be confirmed, but a surge up to $130,000 would likely push the indicator line well beyond the downtrend. This would be the first stage in the process of attempting to nullify bearish divergence. There is still a long way to go for the indicator to reach the previous high of 87.6. If the indicator line fails to get there, this strong bearish divergence would likely be the major factor for the commencement of the next bear market.

The $119,000 resistance is the first target, then a higher high above $119,640, and finally a take out of the $121,000 high before the final ascent to the all-time high at $123,200. If however the bears are able to take control, just under $116,000 would be the last line in the sand before a potential rapid collapse to $112,000. Going below $109,000 would be cause for major concern. Strong support structure below Source: TradingView The weekly chart shows that if the price can get above $119,000 we could be back to smooth sailing and another leg higher, perhaps to $130,000. If on the other hand the price does fall back down, decent price structure, formed by the tops of the falling wedge and the bull flag, would probably act as strong support, and a bounce would be likely to occur from there. RSI trend break on 2-week chart Source: TradingView It’s the 2-week chart that holds a big clue as to where the $BTC price is going next. At the bottom of the chart is the Relative Strength Index (RSI), which signals overbought and oversold conditions. It can be seen in the chart that the indicator has just popped its head above the downtrend line. There is still the best part of two weeks before this can be confirmed, but a surge up to $130,000 would likely push the indicator line well beyond the downtrend. This would be the first stage in the process of attempting to nullify bearish divergence. There is still a long way to go for the indicator to reach the previous high of 87.6. If the indicator line fails to get there, this strong bearish divergence would likely be the major factor for the commencement of the next bear market.

2025-07-22 11:03:32+00:00,SpaceX just moved over $150 million in Bitcoin,"After more than three years of inactivity in the crypto market, SpaceX broke the silence with a monster move on July 22. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence , a wallet owned by Elon Musk’s company moved 1,308 Bitcoin ( BTC ), worth around $153 million, from Coinbase to a fresh address. The motivation behind the transfer is still unclear, and no further moves have been spotted, although it is clear there was no change in SpaceX’s net holdings. As reported by Arkham , the aerospace giant still holds 6,977 BTC, valued at approximately $815 million. SpaceX BTC moves. Source: Arkham What are Elon Musk’s Bitcoin plans? With the receiving address still inactive, it appears the move could merely indicate a routine wallet reshuffle. However, given Musk’s influence on the market, some speculate the transfer might result in major price movements. The speculations are justified as the transaction makes it clear that SpaceX held a significant Bitcoin position for quite some time, choosing not to liquidate despite market volatility. This, in turn, implies the company might be pursuing a long-term investment strategy, treating BTC as a strategic reserve asset. The timing of the transfer is also significant, as institutional interest in the “digital gold” as a hedge has never been higher, driven by pro-crypto policy shifts. Moreover, Elon Musk recently announced the formation of a new political party, the “America Party,” aiming to disrupt the U.S. two-party system.

Solana''s native sol (SOL) experienced a notable spike in price volatility, rising as high as $200 for the first time since March after Jito Labs, an infrastructure company, announced Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) , designed to counter maximal extractable value strategies, such as front-running and sandwiching. SOL is now tussling with BNB for the No. 5 ranking among the world''s largest cryptocurrencies by market value. Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, is still trading directionless below $120,000, while ether (ETH) pulled back after printing an indecisive Doji candle on Monday. That left the CoinDesk 20 Index of the biggest tokens 2% lower over the past 24 hours. The CoinDesk 80 Index , which encompasses the next 80 largest cryptocurrencies, fell 3.5%, most likely reflecting profit-taking in altcoins after their run-up in the past few days. The pullback comes on the heels of consecutive weekly gains that look to have set the stage for a notable bull run. (Check out the TA section ). ""Solana continues to lead altcoin performance, briefly surpassing $200, boosted by the Block Assembly Marketplace announcement, which introduced enhanced transaction speed and improved network efficiency,"" Valentin Fournier, lead research analyst at BRN, said in an email. ""The broader market, however, failed to hold its momentum, reflecting increased uncertainty as ETF demand slows."" While charts may point to further declines in the near future, the underlying market remains poised for growth, he said. ""Short-term technicals may pressure prices further, but we remain constructive on the cycle overall,"" he noted, pointing to institutional and corporate demand as long-term bullish catalysts. Speaking of institutional adoption, JPMorgan is reportedly considering offering loans backed by customer-held crypto assets, such as BTC and ETH, possibly starting as early as next year. Mexico-listed real estate firm Grupo Murano is planning to adopt BTC as a core strategic asset, with an initial investment of $1 billion and a five-year goal to build a $10 billion reserve . In traditional markets, investors pulled money out of leveraged Strategy (MSTR) ETFs while bargain-hunting the 2x short ETF, a sign of reassessment of directional bets. The greenback was bid against major currencies, including the euro and the risk-sensitive Australian dollar.

2025-07-22 11:17:09+00:00,"Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP Lead the Charge as Altcoin Season Heats Up","The post Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP Lead the Charge as Altcoin Season Heats Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is signaling an early trend shift as capital flows out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. While Bitcoin has long been the dominant player, recent movements suggest that traders are now betting on alternative cryptocurrencies for stronger returns. Bitcoin Dominance Drops as Altcoins Outperform Crypto analyst Kyle Chassé highlighted a notable drop in Bitcoin dominance—from 65% to 60% in just 30 days. This is one of the steepest declines in recent months, signaling a possible rotation toward altcoins. Altcoins have capitalized on this shift: Ethereum surged 26% Dogecoin jumped 40% XRP climbed 22% Cardano rose 23% These consistent gains are not just outperforming Bitcoin—they’re reviving hopes of a new altcoin season. Altcoin Season Index Signals Momentum The Altcoin Season Index has jumped from 35 to 50 over the past month. While the official altseason threshold is 75, this sharp climb reflects increasing momentum in the altcoin market. Investors are growing more confident in altcoins’ upside potential . Supporting this trend, the TOTAL3 market cap, which excludes both Bitcoin and Ethereum, has climbed nearly 33% month-over-month. At the same time, USDT dominance is falling, showing that traders are moving funds out of stablecoins and back into riskier assets. With Bitcoin’s price action stalling, the spotlight is now squarely on altcoins. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Crash: XRP, ETH and XLM Pullback Despite Trump’s ‘Stamp of Approval’ For Crypto , Altseason Is Close, But Not Confirmed Not everyone is convinced. Investor Mourad Farouni compared the current market setup to the post-2016 election rally, noting that while things look bullish, a full confirmation of altseason hasn’t yet occurred. Meanwhile, analyst Michaël van de Poppe sees the recent dip as a healthy correction, not a bearish reversal. He believes that short-term volatility is expected during an early-stage altcoin bull cycle and encourages traders to stay focused on technicals rather than give in to panic. “Selling out of fear isn’t a strategy if your long-term thesis is intact,” he says. All indicators point to a market leaning heavily into altcoins. From price performance to volume shifts, the signals are stacking up.

The post Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP Lead the Charge as Altcoin Season Heats Up appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is signaling an early trend shift as capital flows out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. While Bitcoin has long been the dominant player, recent movements suggest that traders are now betting on alternative cryptocurrencies for stronger returns. Bitcoin Dominance Drops as Altcoins Outperform Crypto analyst Kyle Chassé highlighted a notable drop in Bitcoin dominance—from 65% to 60% in just 30 days. This is one of the steepest declines in recent months, signaling a possible rotation toward altcoins. Altcoins have capitalized on this shift: Ethereum surged 26% Dogecoin jumped 40% XRP climbed 22% Cardano rose 23% These consistent gains are not just outperforming Bitcoin—they’re reviving hopes of a new altcoin season. Altcoin Season Index Signals Momentum The Altcoin Season Index has jumped from 35 to 50 over the past month. While the official altseason threshold is 75, this sharp climb reflects increasing momentum in the altcoin market. Investors are growing more confident in altcoins’ upside potential . Supporting this trend, the TOTAL3 market cap, which excludes both Bitcoin and Ethereum, has climbed nearly 33% month-over-month. At the same time, USDT dominance is falling, showing that traders are moving funds out of stablecoins and back into riskier assets. With Bitcoin’s price action stalling, the spotlight is now squarely on altcoins. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Crash: XRP, ETH and XLM Pullback Despite Trump’s ‘Stamp of Approval’ For Crypto , Altseason Is Close, But Not Confirmed Not everyone is convinced. Investor Mourad Farouni compared the current market setup to the post-2016 election rally, noting that while things look bullish, a full confirmation of altseason hasn’t yet occurred. Meanwhile, analyst Michaël van de Poppe sees the recent dip as a healthy correction, not a bearish reversal. He believes that short-term volatility is expected during an early-stage altcoin bull cycle and encourages traders to stay focused on technicals rather than give in to panic. “Selling out of fear isn’t a strategy if your long-term thesis is intact,” he says. All indicators point to a market leaning heavily into altcoins. From price performance to volume shifts, the signals are stacking up. If momentum holds, the coming weeks could confirm the arrival of a full-blown altseason, with huge potential upside for early movers. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

It’s worth noting that Schiff has long been a critic of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, arguing the asset has no intrinsic value and consistently advocating for gold instead. Schiff pointed out that Ethereum is trading near the top of its range, making it, in his view, an ideal time to sell. He believes the recent upswing is more likely a bear market rally than a sustained recovery, he said in an X post on July 21. “Ether is back near the upper end of its trading range again. If you own any, this is a great time to sell. As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether,” the economist noted. His comments come at a time when Ethereum’s push toward the $4,000 mark has faltered, with the asset retreating amid profit-taking. At press time, ETH was trading at $3,685, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, though still up 23% in the past week. Bitcoin, by contrast, is consolidating around $119,060. ETH and BTC seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Ethereum’s competition While Schiff remains skeptical of both Bitcoin and Ethereum as long-term investments , he views Ethereum as being at a relative disadvantage. According to him, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap faces stronger competition in its use-case narrative, whereas Bitcoin continues to dominate as the leading digital asset. As such, he argued that Ethereum is underperforming compared to Bitcoin, and may continue to do so. https://twitter.com/PeterSchiff/status/1947345315046068455 For investors insistent on holding crypto, Schiff sees a better risk-reward trade in rotating out of Ethereum and into Bitcoin, despite his broader reservations about the entire asset class. Beyond the Ethereum-Bitcoin debate, Schiff also renewed his criticism of political support for digital assets. The economist warned that efforts to promote domestic investment in crypto, particularly under President Donald Trump, could inadvertently accelerate the collapse of the U.S. dollar. In such a scenario, Schiff maintained, while Bitcoin holders might expect to benefit, gold would ultimately emerge as the real winner.

With a growing list of bullish developments and rising mainstream adoption, many traders are now asking the big question: Can XRP actually reach $100 in 2025? While that might sound like an unrealistic prediction, one analyst took a closer look at what’s fueling this speculation and whether it’s really possible. What’s Driving the Hype? There’s no doubt that XRP has had a rocky journey over the past few years, especially with its ongoing legal battle with the SEC. But now, things are turning around. One of the biggest reasons people are getting bullish on XRP is the possible approval of an XRP ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund). If approved, it would allow institutional investors to buy into XRP more easily, just like they do with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. That could bring in billions of dollars in new money—and send prices soaring. In addition to the ETF, Ripple is allegedly planning to go public. Once Ripple becomes a publicly traded company, it could bring even more attention and legitimacy to XRP and its technology. But the biggest long-term catalyst could be bank adoption. If banks around the world start using XRP to move money, that could replace the outdated SWIFT system, which is slow and expensive. XRP transactions are fast, cheap, and energy-efficient. If trillions of dollars begin flowing through XRP every day, demand could skyrocket and so could the price. Search Interest Is Exploding One surprising data point is Google search volume. Interest in XRP is now reaching record highs. Even higher than in 2017 and 2021 bull markets. When this kind of retail interest spikes, it often leads to massive price movements. People are asking everywhere: “Should I buy XRP?” And that rising curiosity can fuel even more buying pressure. Short-Term Price Targets and Buy Zones Right now, XRP is showing a strong bullish trend. The analyst said that watching key levels like $3.30 and $3.16 as possible pullback zones before the next leg up. If Bitcoin pulls back slightly, it might give traders a chance to scoop up XRP before it pushes to $5. What Needs to Happen for $100 to Be Realistic? 100 is a huge number for XRP. For it to get there, a lot would have to happen: Massive global adoption by banks and financial institutions ETF approval and institutional inflows Ripple’s IPO bringing new credibility and exposure A multi-year bull market that drives the entire crypto market higher Trillions in daily volume flowing through XRP as a payment solution",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/can-xrp-price-hit-100-in-2025/,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|REGULATION,News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),BTC,"Can XRP Price Hit $100 in 2025?.

In Q1, the price action remained subdued, primarily due to lingering concerns around U.S. tariff implementations and heightened tensions between Russia and Ukraine. These global issues weighed heavily on market sentiment, keeping BTC in a consolidation phase. However, Q2 brought a notable turnaround. By April and May, easing geopolitical tensions and improved macro signals helped Bitcoin stage a strong rally. By the third week of May, BTC surged to $112,000, marking a significant recovery from earlier lows. Then the price retraced from its May peak, even positive factors like a positive U.S. jobs report on June 6 and resumed U.S.-China trade talks back in June were overshadowed when rising geopolitical concerns between Israel and Iran tensions worsened, triggering renewed selling pressure.

Iran’s defiant response and subsequent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites over the third weekend of June sent BTC sliding to $98,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction July 2025 The Bitcoin price performance in July 2025 has been truly remarkable. Since the last week of June, Bitcoin has broken out of its consolidation phase, driven by whale accumulation, a surge in spot trading volume, and a confirmed technical breakout from a bullish flag pattern. On July 14th, this breakout propelled Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $123,231. However, the momentum faced a pause as traders took profits and the market sought to recover from exhaustion. However, now the RSI has indicated this cool down is completed by dropping from 75 to 65. The tool suggests that Bitcoin is gearing up for another surge that could push it back into price discovery. From a technical standpoint, the Bitcoin price is now eyeing the psychological milestone of $125,000. If the upward momentum continues, this level could be tested before the month wraps up.

2025-07-22 11:30:12+00:00,"Eric Trump Mocks Critics Amid Ether Price Surge, What’s Next for Crypto?","Eric Trump took to X on Monday to celebrate Ether price climb above $3,800 , taking a jab at critics who mocked him earlier this year for supporting the cryptocurrency. “How am I doing now @TedPillows?” Trump posted, referring to a three-month-old remark from Ted Pillows, a partner at crypto exchange OKX, who had mocked Trump in April following Ether’s decline in February and March. Trump continued his online rebuttals by telling another user, “Up 35% in 5 months, Pal. Embrace volatility,” adding that those who followed his advice to “buy the dips” would now be in profit. Data from CoinGecko shows that Ether was trading at around $2,877 when Trump announced his support for the coin on February 4. At its current level near $3,732, investors would be sitting on roughly 30% in unrealized gains, despite the coin experiencing a steep 49% drop shortly after Trump’s post earlier in the year. Ether Eyes $8,000 as Analysts Track Patterns While Ether has gained 12% so far in 2025, some analysts are seeing a bigger move on the horizon. On Sunday, analyst Gert van Lagen noted a similarity between Ether’s current structure and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 1980, predicting that Ether could reach $8,000 by early 2026 as it enters what he believes is the final phase of its long-term bullish cycle. These comments arrive amid a broader crypto market recovery, with Ether leading a steady rally over the past month. Renewed optimism around Ethereum’s network upgrades, increasing institutional interest in tokenization, and reduced selling pressure have all contributed to its recent price gains, strengthening bullish sentiment in the market. Trump Family’s Expanding Crypto Footprint The Trump family’s involvement in crypto ventures extends beyond social media posts. On Monday, Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the Truth Social platform, announced it holds $2 billion worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities. The company has raised $2.5 billion to support its Bitcoin strategy, with plans to expand its crypto holdings based on market conditions. Eric Trump, along with his brothers Donald Trump Jr. and Barron Trump, co-founded American Bitcoin, a company that has raised $220 million to acquire Bitcoin for its treasury and to purchase mining equipment. Additionally, all three brothers are co-founders of World Liberty Financial , where President Trump serves as co-founder emeritus. This reflects the family’s increasing influence within the cryptocurrency industry as the sector evolves alongside the upcoming election cycle.

Eric Trump took to X on Monday to celebrate Ether price climb above $3,800 , taking a jab at critics who mocked him earlier this year for supporting the cryptocurrency. “How am I doing now @TedPillows?” Trump posted, referring to a three-month-old remark from Ted Pillows, a partner at crypto exchange OKX, who had mocked Trump in April following Ether’s decline in February and March. Trump continued his online rebuttals by telling another user, “Up 35% in 5 months, Pal. Embrace volatility,” adding that those who followed his advice to “buy the dips” would now be in profit. Data from CoinGecko shows that Ether was trading at around $2,877 when Trump announced his support for the coin on February 4. At its current level near $3,732, investors would be sitting on roughly 30% in unrealized gains, despite the coin experiencing a steep 49% drop shortly after Trump’s post earlier in the year. Ether Eyes $8,000 as Analysts Track Patterns While Ether has gained 12% so far in 2025, some analysts are seeing a bigger move on the horizon. On Sunday, analyst Gert van Lagen noted a similarity between Ether’s current structure and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in 1980, predicting that Ether could reach $8,000 by early 2026 as it enters what he believes is the final phase of its long-term bullish cycle. These comments arrive amid a broader crypto market recovery, with Ether leading a steady rally over the past month. Renewed optimism around Ethereum’s network upgrades, increasing institutional interest in tokenization, and reduced selling pressure have all contributed to its recent price gains, strengthening bullish sentiment in the market.

2025-07-22 11:30:14+00:00,"XRP Could Skyrocket 500% Against Bitcoin, Analyst Warns","CryptoInsightUK believes the long-awaited altcoin season has finally begun—and that XRP could be its headline act. In a 13-minute market update posted on July 21, the British analyst argued that last week’s dramatic collapse in Bitcoin dominance “erased 19 weeks of Bitcoin strength in a single candle,” a move he called the first clear signal of a sustained rotation into altcoins. “Volume tells the story,” he said, pointing to the outsized red bar that accompanied the dominance drop. The pattern, he noted, mirrors the December 2020 setup that preceded the last explosive altcoin cycle. If dominance continues to unwind at a comparable speed, it could slip to the 39 percent zone within seven weeks—giving altcoins room to outperform. XRP Could Rally 500% Against Bitcoin That macro backdrop matters because, in the same breath, XRP just printed the highest weekly close in its history. CryptoInsightUK highlighted an “accumulation-then-breakout” structure on the XRP/USD chart that resembles Bitcoin-dominance’s own staircase lower. “It’s continuation, in my opinion,” he said, adding that XRP’s breach of its 2017-2018 all-time-high band could usher in a series of higher highs. Related Reading: XRP Targets $6–$10 If Bitcoin Hits $144,000, Analyst Predicts Liquidity data bolsters the thesis. Heat-maps from TradingDifferent show “significant liquidity to the upside… all the way now up to about $4.26,” the analyst said. He expects XRP to attack that magnet “probably within this week” and believes a run to $4.50 is “imminent” if Bitcoin breaks its nearby resistance shelf. The bolder call, however, is denominated in satoshis. With XRP/BTC perched just below its last meaningful resistance, CryptoInsightUK sees scope for a rally of “at least another 200 percent—potentially up to 500 percent—against Bitcoin” once the pair clears the level. Such a move, he argued, would propel XRP’s market-share to the 14–20 percent range, up from roughly 2 percent today, and would likely coincide with Bitcoin itself pushing toward the $135,000–$150,000 corridor. “Things are going to get exciting pretty quick,” he warned, urging followers to prepare profit-taking plans in advance. Related Reading: The XRP Euphoria Phase: Why August–October 2025 Could Be Explosive Though the video focused on XRP, the analyst revealed he recently took full profits on his sizeable Ethena (ENA) position after a 100 percent gain in two weeks, citing over-exposure and extreme daily RSI readings. The sale, he said, lifted his cash buffer from 2 percent to about 5 percent, giving him “the opportunity to hold my XRP bag for longer”. CryptoInsightUK acknowledged that timing any cycle top is notoriously difficult. “No one nails the cycle,” he conceded, promising to disclose his own exit strategy in real-time once price action justifies it. For traders who do not “live the charts,” he recommended a disciplined take-profit plan rather than aiming for absolute peaks. For now, the spotlight stays on two charts: Bitcoin dominance and XRP/BTC. A decisive breakdown in the former and a clean breakout in the latter would, in the analyst’s words, “ignite altseason” and validate the 500 percent upside scenario. Whether that firework display begins this week or takes a little longer, he insisted, “there’s no reason we couldn’t do something like this”—and sketched a near-vertical path higher.

2025-07-22 11:31:39+00:00,Retail Dumps Bitcoin (BTC) on Binance as Whales Quietly Load Up,"Bitcoin is currently trading above $118,000, and while it hasn’t yet been able to reclaim last week’s all-time high, the asset is still almost 15% up over the past month. Despite the ongoing bullish sentiment, retail investors are still offloading Bitcoin on Binance as evidenced by a surge in retail inflows that aligns with signs of profit-taking. Retail Selling Into Strength According to the latest figures shared by CryptoQuant, Binance’s 30-day retail inflow has spiked from $12 billion to over $16 billion. This was indicative of an increased selling activity as BTC’s price climbed toward recent highs. A similar pattern emerged in April 2025, when Bitcoin rose from $78,000 to $111,000 by the end of May. During this time, retail traders also offloaded significant portions of their holdings amidst the uptrend and ultimately missed out on the full upside. This recurring behavior points to a tendency among retail investors to sell into strength. Such behaviour is likely driven by fear or short-term profit motives, rather than holding for potential further gains. Further confirming this sell-off pattern, Binance’s Net Taker Volume has turned negative, which reflects a bearish sentiment among market takers. Negative net taker volume indicates that sellers are dominating, either by liquidating long positions or entering new short positions in anticipation of a potential pullback. This sentiment among retail traders suggests that many remain unconvinced of the rally’s sustainability. On the other hand, whales are aggressively accumulating during this period of retail selling. Data from Whales Screener reveals that in the past 24 hours alone, whales have withdrawn over $400 million in Ethereum and nearly $200 million in Bitcoin from centralized exchanges. Such large withdrawals typically indicate a firm belief in a continued market uptrend, as whales use the liquidity from retail sellers to build positions. This behavior is consistent with past trends where retail exits during rallies while whales continue accumulating. Bitcoin’s Path to $140K Amid this divergence between retail selling and whale accumulation, attention is now turning to what analysts expect for Bitcoin’s next major move. Analyst Mr. Wall Street, for one, expects Bitcoin to climb to $140,000 mid-term, but warned that sell-side pressures may cap gains. The crypto asset has held above $117,000 and aims for $120,000-$123,500 short-term before a potential run toward $133,000-$140,000. However, wallets that accumulated BTC during the 2022 lows are now offloading. This pattern was seen before previous cycle peaks.

But what if an AI-driven education company not only embraced it but set an incredibly ambitious target? This is precisely what Genius Group, a pioneer in AI-driven education, has done by significantly expanding its Bitcoin holdings , signaling a profound commitment to the future of digital finance and blockchain technology. Understanding Genius Group’s Bold Move in Bitcoin Holdings Imagine a company not just dipping its toes but diving headfirst into the world of cryptocurrency. That’s Genius Group for you. In July, this innovative AI-driven education company made headlines by doubling its Bitcoin holdings to a substantial 200 BTC. This wasn’t just a casual purchase; it was a strategic move, acquiring 20 BTC at a discount, as reported by Cointelegraph. What makes this particularly fascinating is their audacious long-term vision: to accumulate a staggering 10,000 BTC within the next two years. This commitment to increasing their Bitcoin holdings is more than just an investment; it’s a statement. It positions Genius Group as a forward-thinking entity that recognizes the transformative potential of digital assets. For an education company, integrating such a significant financial strategy with their core business is a testament to their belief in the future convergence of technology, finance, and learning. To put their current and target Bitcoin holdings into perspective, consider the following: Metric Current (July 2023) Ambitious Target (Next 2 Years) Bitcoin Holdings (BTC) 200 BTC 10,000 BTC Growth Factor Doubled from previous 50x increase from current Acquisition Strategy Discounted purchases Aggressive accumulation Beyond Accumulation: Genius Group’s Broader Crypto Strategy and Bitcoin Holdings Genius Group’s ambition extends far beyond merely accumulating Bitcoin holdings . Their strategy is multi-faceted, aiming to weave blockchain and cryptocurrency into the very fabric of their educational ecosystem. This holistic approach suggests a long-term commitment to the digital economy, not just as an investor, but as an active participant and innovator. Expanding Blockchain Education Initiatives: As an education company, it’s only natural for Genius Group to lead by example. They are actively developing and expanding educational programs focused on blockchain technology. This means equipping students and professionals with the knowledge and skills necessary to thrive in a decentralized future, understanding everything from crypto fundamentals to advanced blockchain applications. Developing Tokenized Rewards: Imagine being rewarded for your learning achievements with digital tokens! Genius Group is exploring tokenized reward systems, which could revolutionize how students are incentivized and recognized. This innovative approach could foster greater engagement and create a tangible value for educational milestones within their ecosystem. Introducing Stablecoins: The development of stablecoins within their framework suggests an aim to provide a more predictable and less volatile digital currency for transactions within their platform. Stablecoins, pegged to traditional assets like the US dollar, can offer the benefits of blockchain technology without the dramatic price swings often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Pursuing U.S. Licenses under the GENIUS Act: A critical component of their strategy is navigating the regulatory landscape. By actively pursuing U.S. licenses under what they refer to as the ‘GENIUS Act,’ the company demonstrates a commitment to operating within established legal frameworks. This step is crucial for building trust, ensuring compliance, and facilitating broader adoption of their crypto initiatives. Why Are Companies Like Genius Group Increasing Their Bitcoin Holdings? The decision by companies to significantly increase their Bitcoin holdings isn’t made lightly. It reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties and its potential role in a diversified corporate treasury strategy. So, what are the compelling reasons behind such a bold move?

Block announced last week that effective July 23rd, the firm will be part of the top index, which tracks the stock performance of 500 large companies listed on US stock exchanges. The tech billionaire’s firm was previously known as Square and is recognized for payment services like Cash App, and also launched a self-custody BTC wallet called Bitkey. Additionally, Block owns the 12th-largest public corporate Bitcoin treasury in the world, holding 8,584 BTC worth around $1.01 billion at time of writing. The firm is sitting on a 286% unrealized profit on its BTC, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net . In April, Block settled with the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) amid alleged compliance issues with its Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) program. NYDFS says Block committed lapses with how it operated Cash App, the firm’s peer-to-peer money transmission service that began offering BTC transactions back in 2018. The regulator alleged Block failed to complete adequate customer due diligence and implement controls to prevent anti-money laundering and other illicit activities. NYDFS also claimed the company did not promptly address severe transaction alert backlogs, largely due to rapid growth between 2019 and 2020. The regulator alleged Block’s lax treatment of high-risk Bitcoin transactions enabled anonymous transactions to push through without proper scrutiny.

The XRP Army continues to be highly bullish on the asset, with massive double-digit price predictions. As such, we decided to ask the four most popular AI solutions (ChatGPT, Grok, Perplexity, and Gemini) about their take on its peak this cycle. Peak Goals Building on our ‘We Asked…’ collection of crypto-oriented questions, more on which you can read here and here , this time, we wanted to know what the AIs think about XRP’s potential this cycle. After all, it already did what many thought was impossible and broke its January 2018 all-time high of $3.4 last week by surging past $3.6 to set a new one. The AIs in question provided a few types of answers when it came down to price predictions, ranging from “realistic” to “aggressive/far-fetched.” Perplexity, for example, noted that the majority of crypto analysts on X believe the asset will peak somewhere between $5 and $10. Basing its projections on technical analysis, the chatbot mostly reaffirmed its target, setting it at $6 to $8 or even $10 under more favorable conditions. Gemini’s moderate/conservative estimates envision a top of $6, while the so-called “bullish but achievable targets” are similar to those of Perplexity. “Bullish but Achievable Targets: A common range for a strong bull run is $7-$10. This is often cited by analysts who believe in significant institutional adoption and a favorable regulatory environment. Some predictions suggest XRP could reach $7.5-$8.2 by August 2025, and $9.0-$9.8 by September 2025, potentially hitting $18-$20 by December 2025.” Grok and ChatGPT were less bullish on XRP’s potential this cycle, outlining $5.50 ot $7 as the “moderate” scenarios. When it came down to the aggressive approach, both said the asset could surpass $10 and aim at $15. Factors That Can Drive XRP This High Although their price ranges may vary slightly, the four AI solutions were essentially in agreement about the potential factors that could drive XRP to these heights. For example, they all believe a spot Ripple ETF will help the underlying asset thrive, similar to BTC and ETH as of late. The chances for such a financial product to see the green light by the end of the year are pretty high, with both experts and Polymarket displaying them at roughly 90%. The AIs also noted that massive capital rotation from Bitcoin to alts will help XRP, which is the second-largest altcoin, gain further traction. Additionally, they outlined corporate/central bank settlement pilots using the XRP Ledger as well as the ISO 20022 update, which is believed to help Ripple’s token. Nevertheless, the AIs highlighted the market’s volatile nature and warned that these numbers are merely predictions. “It’s crucial to remember that these are predictions and not guarantees. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, and prices can change rapidly.

2025-07-22 11:55:19+00:00,"Bitcoin’s Phenomenal Rise: What Does $119,000 Mean for the Market?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Phenomenal Rise: What Does $119,000 Mean for the Market? The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with excitement as Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, recently achieved a remarkable milestone, soaring past the $119,000 mark. This significant leap in the Bitcoin price has captured global attention, prompting investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike to ponder its implications for the broader market. What exactly does this monumental achievement signify, and what factors are propelling Bitcoin to such unprecedented heights? Understanding the Bitcoin Price Milestone: A Closer Look at $119,000 According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World market, BTC has indeed risen above $119,000, specifically trading at $119,020 on the Binance USDT market. This isn’t just a number; it represents a significant psychological and technical level for many in the crypto space. While Bitcoin has seen numerous rallies and corrections throughout its history, each new peak or sustained high value ignites fresh discussions about its intrinsic value, adoption rates, and future potential. Such a robust movement in the Bitcoin price often signals strong market confidence and a confluence of bullish factors. It reflects a growing belief in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and an increasingly accepted digital asset in the global financial landscape. For many, reaching this level is a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and its evolving narrative from a niche digital experiment to a serious contender in the world of finance. What’s Fueling This Bitcoin Price Ascent? Key Drivers Behind the Rally Several intertwined factors contribute to Bitcoin’s impressive upward trajectory. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to grasp the dynamics of the current Bitcoin price rally. Institutional Adoption: One of the most significant catalysts is the increasing embrace by institutional investors. Major corporations, investment funds, and even some sovereign entities are now allocating portions of their portfolios to digital assets. This institutional validation not only brings substantial capital into the market but also lends an air of legitimacy and stability, attracting more mainstream attention. The launch of new financial products, such as spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions, has opened doors for a wider range of investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset, further boosting demand and influencing the Bitcoin price . Supply Dynamics (Halving Event): Bitcoin’s supply is finite, capped at 21 million coins. Approximately every four years, the reward for mining new blocks is halved, a process known as the ‘halving.’ This reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation, effectively creating a supply shock if demand remains constant or increases. Historical data often shows a significant Bitcoin price rally in the months following a halving event, as scarcity plays a crucial role. Macroeconomic Environment: Global economic conditions also play a vital role. When traditional markets face uncertainty, inflation concerns rise, or fiat currencies experience instability, investors often look for alternative assets to preserve wealth. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and perceived inflation-hedging properties, becomes an attractive option, driving up its demand and consequently the Bitcoin price . Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability (e.g., Lightning Network) and security, enhances its utility and attractiveness. A growing number of users, transactions, and developers building on the network signal a healthy and expanding ecosystem, which positively reinforces the Bitcoin price . Growing Retail Interest: While institutional money is powerful, the collective buying power and enthusiasm of retail investors remain a significant force. Increased media coverage, social media trends, and word-of-mouth generate broader public interest, leading to more individuals entering the market and contributing to the upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . The Ripple Effect: How the Bitcoin Price Impacts the Wider Crypto Ecosystem When Bitcoin makes significant moves, the entire cryptocurrency market tends to feel the tremors. Bitcoin’s dominance often dictates the overall market sentiment, and its price action frequently serves as a leading indicator for altcoins. Altcoin Performance: A strong Bitcoin price rally often precedes or accompanies a surge in altcoin prices. This phenomenon, sometimes called ‘altcoin season,’ occurs as profits from Bitcoin are rotated into other promising digital assets, or as newfound confidence in the overall crypto market encourages investment across the board.

2025-07-22 11:56:30+00:00,Bitcoin Dominance Falls—Altseason Takeover or Quiet Before $140K BTC Surge?,"Bitcoin’s share in the cryptocurrency market is declining, sparking curiosity and debate. Is a surge in alternative coins on the horizon, signaling a new market leader? Or is this a temporary dip before Bitcoin climbs to an unprecedented $140,000? The shifting dynamics are drawing attention, leaving many eager to see what unfolds next. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $14 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: The Digital Coin Reshaping Our Money World Bitcoin, or BTC, is the first of its kind—a digital currency that lets you send money directly to others without a bank. Think of it as electronic cash that works over the internet. It was created by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto to make transactions simple and free from control by any single authority. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin operates on a shared record called the blockchain. This means every transaction is tracked across many computers, keeping it secure and open. People known as miners help verify these transactions by solving puzzles, earning new bitcoins as a reward. There’s a limit of 21 million bitcoins, making each one special. Today, Bitcoin stands out in the financial world. Every four years or so, the rewards for miners are cut in half in an event called a “halving.” This slows down how quickly new bitcoins are made, which can make existing ones more valuable. While new cryptocurrencies pop up all the time, Bitcoin remains the most famous and trusted. Its limited supply and growing use by businesses make it an attractive choice in the current market. With more people and companies embracing it, Bitcoin’s future looks bright in the ever-changing landscape of digital money. Ethereum’s Next Leap: Scaling Up for a Decentralized Future Ethereum, launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, has been a game-changer in the blockchain world. As a pioneering Proof-of-Stake blockchain, it introduced smart contracts that power a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). From decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ethereum’s versatility is unmatched. The network’s transition to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 marked a significant evolution, reducing energy consumption and setting the stage for increased scalability. Upcoming innovations like sharding aim to boost transaction speeds and lower costs, while Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon enhance efficiency. Ether (ETH) remains the heartbeat of this ecosystem, essential for transactions and rewarding those who help secure the network. In the current market cycle, Ethereum’s advancements make it a standout among cryptocurrencies. Price predictions suggest that ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year, reflecting optimism based on historical trends and Bitcoin’s halving cycles. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s robust technology and active development community give it a competitive edge. Market trends indicate a growing interest in platforms that offer scalability and real-world applications, areas where Ethereum excels. Its commitment to decentralization and continuous improvement positions it attractively for those watching the crypto space evolve.

Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin: The Digital Coin Reshaping Our Money World Bitcoin, or BTC, is the first of its kind—a digital currency that lets you send money directly to others without a bank. Think of it as electronic cash that works over the internet. It was created by someone called Satoshi Nakamoto to make transactions simple and free from control by any single authority. Instead of physical coins, Bitcoin operates on a shared record called the blockchain. This means every transaction is tracked across many computers, keeping it secure and open. People known as miners help verify these transactions by solving puzzles, earning new bitcoins as a reward. There’s a limit of 21 million bitcoins, making each one special. Today, Bitcoin stands out in the financial world. Every four years or so, the rewards for miners are cut in half in an event called a “halving.” This slows down how quickly new bitcoins are made, which can make existing ones more valuable. While new cryptocurrencies pop up all the time, Bitcoin remains the most famous and trusted. Its limited supply and growing use by businesses make it an attractive choice in the current market. With more people and companies embracing it, Bitcoin’s future looks bright in the ever-changing landscape of digital money. Ethereum’s Next Leap: Scaling Up for a Decentralized Future Ethereum, launched by Vitalik Buterin in 2015, has been a game-changer in the blockchain world. As a pioneering Proof-of-Stake blockchain, it introduced smart contracts that power a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). From decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Ethereum’s versatility is unmatched. The network’s transition to Proof-of-Stake with the Merge in 2022 marked a significant evolution, reducing energy consumption and setting the stage for increased scalability. Upcoming innovations like sharding aim to boost transaction speeds and lower costs, while Layer 2 solutions such as Arbitrum and Polygon enhance efficiency. Ether (ETH) remains the heartbeat of this ecosystem, essential for transactions and rewarding those who help secure the network. In the current market cycle, Ethereum’s advancements make it a standout among cryptocurrencies. Price predictions suggest that ETH could reach as high as $6,580.53 next year, reflecting optimism based on historical trends and Bitcoin’s halving cycles. Compared to other coins, Ethereum’s robust technology and active development community give it a competitive edge. Market trends indicate a growing interest in platforms that offer scalability and real-world applications, areas where Ethereum excels. Its commitment to decentralization and continuous improvement positions it attractively for those watching the crypto space evolve.

Overall, the market is down today, with the large majority of the top 100 coins per market capitalization decreasing. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $269 billion, still maintaining similar levels to those seen over the past week. TLDR: Crypto market cap dipped below $4 trillion; Majority of top 100 coins are red; BTC and ETH are down today, trading at $117,854 and $3,692; ETH outperforms BTC in weekly increases: 20% vs 1%; Solana is the only green coin among the top 10 per market cap; Market sentiment remains in the greed zone; US BTC spot ETFs broke a green streak with $131 million in outflows; US ETH spot ETFs continue positive flows with 12 straight days of inflows; We are in the 5th and final wave of the bull market; There seems to be “genuine institutional adoption,” and “not speculative fever”. Crypto Winners & Losers Over the past 24 hours, at the time of writing, only one of the top 10 coins per market cap is green. Bitcoin (BTC) fell by 1.2% in this period to the price of $117,854. While it decreased below $118,000, it’s holding firmly above $117,500. Also, Ethereum (ETH) fell by 2.7%, currently trading at $3,692. The price is still on track towards the $4,000 mark. The highest drop is 3.2% by Dogecoin (DOGE) . It’s now trading at $0.2647. The only green coin on this list is Solana (SOL) . It appreciated 5.1%, currently changing hands at $198.97. In the top 100 coins category, Kaspa (KAS) is the highest gainer. It’s up 9.8% to the price of $0.1153. Jupiter (JUP) follows with an increase of 8.6%, now trading at $0.6531. Most coins, however, recorded price decreases today. Pump.fun (PUMP) saw a double-digit drop of 13.1% to $0.003751. SPX6900 (SPX) follows, with a 6.7% fall to the price of $1.84. The capital flowing out of Bitcoin ETFs, as discussed below, could suggest lowered institutional appetite, though likely a short-term one. This appetite is likely dampened by concerns around global tariffs and trade tensions, particularly as the 1 August deadline approaches when the US may slap massive tariffs on its trade partners, push the deadline, or change its mind again. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase is reportedly looking into l ending against clients’ Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings starting next year. Lending against crypto would let users pledge their BTC and ETH holdings to borrow loans.

We are in the 5 th and final wave of the bull market, as the chart below shows. It should complete towards the end of 2025 or early 2026, at a BTC price of some $136,000 to $140,000, he said. “So while people will be worried about where the bear market will take us in 2026, my view is that this is not something to worry about today, as there is still additional upside to BTC prices in this bull market! Stay focused on participating in and enjoying the ride higher until the end of the year.” However, he warns that if BTC trades below $112,000 in the short term, we could see another test of $100,000 before the next move up. “But this is a low probability outcome in my view,” Glover argues. Source: Ledn Moreover, Werner Brönnimann, Investment Manager at crypto bank AMINA , commented that Bitcoin’s recent push to over $123,000 and breaching $4 trillion market cap appears to represent a fundamental shift in market dynamics. This shift is driven primarily by institutional capital, not “the retail-led manias of previous cycles.” Now, there seems to be “genuine institutional adoption,” and “not speculative fever.” Moreover, we’re seeing sustained inflows from pension funds and corporate treasuries, not social media-driven FOMO (fear of missing out), Brönnimann says. Still, “despite Bitcoin’s remarkable performance, the market is not officially in ‘Altcoin Season’ yet,” he adds. That said, the macro environment could still challenge BTC’s trajectory regardless of institutional adoption, says Brönnimann. Regulatory clarity supports institutional inflows, but BTC remains sensitive to monetary policy shifts. “Aggressive [US Federal Reserve] tightening in response to tariff-driven inflation could override even strong institutional demand.” Therefore, “this dynamic underscores Bitcoin’s evolution as institutional money continues to flow into the asset class: it is no longer an alternative asset with its purely idiosyncratic return drivers, but to an extent behaves like a risk-on asset,” Brönnimann concludes.

2025-07-22 12:00:02+00:00,Tron outperformed Bitcoin without an altseason,"Tron (TRX) is emerging as an unexpected frontrunner in the crypto market’s latest rotation, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) since March, prompting analysts to consider whether a more selective form of altseason is already underway. New data from blockchain analytics firms CryptoQuant and Nansen shows TRX is gaining momentum amid a broader consolidation of Bitcoin’s market dominance. While BTC continues to lead institutional flows, the recent decoupling of TRX from Bitcoin’s price action has triggered renewed discussion about altcoin market cycles, though with a more tempered outlook than in past bull runs. “We might not see a broad altseason in 2025,” a CryptoQuant analyst wrote in a recent post . “Instead, a selected group of ‘premium’ altcoins will likely outperform Bitcoin.” TRX decouples from BTC amid strong network activity Tron’s recent outperformance is not just speculative; it’s backed by on-chain data. In the past 24 hours alone, the network registered over 2.55 million active addresses (up 12.6%) and more than 9 million daily transactions (up 15.6%) in the early hours of Tuesday, July 22, according to analytics platform Nansen. That level of throughput places Tron ahead of many layer 1 competitors in terms of usage and consistency. Tron’s 24-hour transactions and active address data. Source: Nansen . “Stable, consistent, and busy,” Nansen wrote in a post summarizing Tron’s real-time activity metrics. At the time of concluding this story, there have been some significant movements on Tron’s chain growth data as captured by Nansen, with the transaction volume being roughly 3% down. It now has 2.54 million active addresses (up 11.07%) and 8.99 million daily transactions (up 12.07%) over the past 24 hours. CryptoQuant notes that the price correlation between TRX and BTC, which had remained relatively tight earlier this year, has now “decoupled,” a technical shift that often precedes a redistribution of capital into higher-beta altcoins. This divergence is comparable to similar setups observed in previous altcoin rallies, such as those in 2017 and 2021. Correlation and divergence of Bitcoin and Tron price & volume. Source: CryptoQuant . However, unlike in past cycles where capital indiscriminately rotated across dozens of tokens, this time, the capital appears more focused. A narrower, more selective altseason One key difference in this cycle, according to analysts, is the muted retail participation and the absence of a traditional “altseason” where nearly all non-BTC tokens rally simultaneously. Instead, market observers expect a handful of altcoins, like TRX, to lead based on utility, network usage, and stablecoin integrations. Indeed, TRX’s daily transaction count now rivals that of Ethereum and Solana. Much of this activity is powered by USDT (Tether) stablecoin transfers, with Tron accounting for over 50% of all Tether volume. That utility has underpinned TRX’s latest breakout above key resistance levels. Despite TRX’s bullish momentum, analysts caution that Bitcoin’s dominance remains above 50%, which may delay or disrupt full-scale altcoin rallies, according to analysts. Ethereum and Solana continue to attract institutional narratives around real-world assets (RWAs) and tokenized securities, but TRX is carving out its niche by delivering sustained activity without the congestion or high fees plaguing its rivals. Still, skeptics remain. Tron’s reputation has been marred in past years by regulatory scrutiny surrounding founder Justin Sun, and its DeFi ecosystem lacks the composability and capital depth of Ethereum’s. Yet the raw numbers suggest TRX is one of the few tokens bucking Bitcoin’s gravitational pull, and doing so with considerable consistency.

2025-07-22 12:00:25+00:00,Bitcoin Whale Unveiled: Colossal $35.61 Million Deposit Shakes Binance,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Unveiled: Colossal $35.61 Million Deposit Shakes Binance The cryptocurrency world is often described as the wild west of finance, a realm where fortunes are made and lost in the blink of an eye. Amidst this volatility, certain entities command immense attention: the anonymous giants known as ‘Bitcoin Whales’. These holders of vast amounts of cryptocurrency can, with a single transaction, send ripples—or even tidal waves—through the entire market. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of just such a move, as an anonymous Bitcoin Whale executed a significant deposit to Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. This event isn’t just a number; it’s a potential signal, a whisper from the depths of the market that demands our attention. What Just Happened? The Latest Bitcoin Whale Movement In a move that captured the immediate attention of on-chain analysts, an anonymous Bitcoin Whale recently deposited an additional 300 BTC into Binance Exchange. This significant transfer, valued at approximately $35.61 million at the time of the transaction, wasn’t just a standalone event. It brought the whale’s total holdings on the exchange to a staggering 800 BTC, now valued at an impressive $95 million. According to insights shared by Onchain Lens on X, this particular whale has already realized an astounding profit of $93.33 million from their Bitcoin holdings. Latest Deposit: 300 BTC ($35.61 million) Total Holdings on Binance: 800 BTC ($95 million) Realized Profit by the Whale: $93.33 million Such a large deposit to an exchange like Binance immediately raises questions. Is this a strategic move to take profits after a substantial gain? Or is it a repositioning for future trades, perhaps to capitalize on anticipated market shifts? Understanding the implications of such a move requires a deeper dive into the world of these enigmatic market participants. Decoding the Bitcoin Whale: Who Are These Market Movers? The term ‘ Bitcoin Whale ‘ refers to an individual or entity that holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin. While there’s no universally agreed-upon threshold, typically, wallets holding 1,000 BTC or more are considered whale wallets. However, even those with hundreds of BTC, like our anonymous depositor, exert considerable influence due to the sheer volume of their holdings relative to the overall market liquidity. These whales can be early adopters who accumulated Bitcoin when it was mere pennies, institutional investors, mining pools, or even cryptocurrency exchanges themselves. Their movements are closely watched because a large transaction can significantly impact market dynamics, either by increasing selling pressure (if they’re depositing to sell) or signaling accumulation (if they’re withdrawing to cold storage). Different types of whales often exhibit distinct behaviors, each with potential market implications: Type of Whale Characteristic Behavior Potential Market Impact Early Adopter Whales Often long-term holders (HODLers) with a very low cost basis. May move funds for profit-taking after significant price rallies. Large sell-offs can create temporary price dips or corrections. Institutional Whales Large investment firms, hedge funds, or corporations. Moves are often strategic and driven by broader financial mandates. Significant accumulation can signal growing institutional confidence; large distributions might indicate risk-off sentiment. Exchange Whales Funds held by cryptocurrency exchanges themselves, managing user deposits and withdrawals. Large internal movements are usually for operational purposes (e.g., rebalancing hot/cold wallets) and less indicative of market sentiment. Trader Whales Active participants engaging in frequent large-volume trades. Can contribute to short-term volatility, creating flash pumps or dumps. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale’s Move on Binance Matter? The choice of exchange for such a substantial deposit is crucial. Binance, being the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, possesses immense liquidity. When a Bitcoin Whale deposits a significant amount of BTC onto Binance, it typically signals an intent to sell or engage in high-volume trading. This influx of Bitcoin into an exchange’s available supply can, in theory, increase selling pressure. Here’s why it matters: Potential Selling Pressure: A large deposit increases the amount of Bitcoin available for sale on the open market. If the whale decides to sell all or part of their holdings, it could lead to a sudden increase in supply, potentially driving the price down if demand doesn’t match. Market Sentiment: Such moves often trigger speculation among traders and investors. The community tries to decipher the whale’s intentions, which can lead to fear (FUD) or excitement (FOMO), influencing short-term market sentiment. Liquidity Impact: While Binance has deep liquidity, a colossal sell order from a whale can still create a ‘sell wall’ that temporarily halts ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-binance-deposit/,BTC|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB|TRADING,Crypto News|BINANCE|BITCOIN|Crypto Market|on-chain analytics|whale,BTC,"Bitcoin Whale Unveiled: Colossal $35.61 Million Deposit Shakes Binance.

Strategy Has Just Announced A New Bitcoin Acquisition In a new post on X, Strategy Chairman and co-founder Michael Saylor has shared an announcement for the newest Bitcoin acquisition completed by the company. With this buy, the firm has added 6,220 BTC for $739.8 million to its holdings. This has taken the company’s total reserve to 607,770 BTC and total invested value to $43.61 billion. According to the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) , the acquisition was made in the week between July 14th and July 20th. In this period, the BTC price only saw sideways movement, but it seems Strategy was unfazed. Like is usually the case, Saylor also teased this new purchase announcement in advance in an X post . The Strategy Chairman said in the post, “Stay Humble. Stack Sats,” and shared this chart. CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has shared a chart in an X post that puts into perspective where the latest purchase lines up against the other buys from the past year. As displayed in the above graph, the latest acquisition isn’t too big in BTC terms in the grand scheme of things. Since the asset’s price is trading at all-time highs (ATHs), however, the purchase is still expensive in USD terms. The analyst has also shared another chart, this one showcasing the amount of profit that the firm’s Bitcoin holdings are carrying at the moment. From the graph, it’s visible that the unrealized gain associated with Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings has blown up alongside the bull run and today, it sits at a whopping $28 billion. This means that the firm is sitting on more than 64% in the green. In some other news, the Open Interest is diverging between Bitcoin and the altcoins, as Maartunn has pointed out in another X post . The Open Interest measures the total amount of positions related to a given asset or group of assets that are currently open on all centralized derivatives platforms. As is apparent in the chart, the indicator has seen a sharp surge for the altcoins recently, indicating that there has been a flood of speculative interest around them. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has only registered a relatively small uptick in the metric. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted what happened the previous times BTC and the alts diverged in this manner. It would appear that all of these instances coincided with some sort of top for the cryptocurrency. It now remains to be seen whether something similar would follow this time as well.

2025-07-22 12:12:05+00:00,Bitcoin''s Demise Is Inevitable,"Summary Bitcoin''s price surge is driven by hype, institutional adoption, and favorable political shifts, not by intrinsic value or improving fundamentals. Trading volumes and active addresses are declining, indicating weakening underlying activity despite rising prices and increased derivatives speculation. Bullish arguments based on HODL trends and futures activity are double-edged, often signaling overextension and a potential bubble rather than sustainable growth. Given deteriorating fundamentals and reliance on speculation, I maintain a ''strong sell'' rating on BTC-USD, expecting a significant price collapse eventually. The problem with speculative bubbles is that you can be wrong for a long time before ultimately being proven right. This will likely prove to be especially the case when it comes to those who are bearish about Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and many other cryptocurrencies in general. I have argued for a while now that Bitcoin is destined to collapse. This is because it lacks any intrinsic value and is centered around hype and the premise of finding a bigger fool willing to pay more than you did. Recently, Bitcoin prices have been hitting all-time highs. This has been driven by increased adoption at the institutional level, for instance, with the growth of ETFs in the space. The Trump Administration also seems more open to cryptocurrency than previous administrations, which is also fueling the hype. In the short run, there''s no telling how high prices will go. Would I be surprised if they double, triple, or more? No, I wouldn''t. At the end of the day, I believe that it will drop, though. And I would also argue that there is mounting evidence that the underlying fundamentals are weakening. Because of this, I have no problem maintaining Bitcoin as a ‘strong sell’ candidate. A Note on Speculative Bubbles I consider myself to be an avid reader of all things finance and economics. I am especially interested these days in the economic history of the Dutch Republic, but I digress. In recent years, one of the best financial books that I have read is Boom and Bust: A Global History of Financial Bubbles , which naturally talks about financial bubbles that have developed over the centuries. Some of these are bubbles that are household names. Others, like the British bicycle bubble, are unknown to the vast majority of society. In that book, the authors present the idea of the Bubble Triangle. Author Simply put, the Bubble Triangle represents the three elements needed in order for a speculative bubble to come into existence. These are marketability, money/credit, and speculation. Marketability refers to how easy it is to buy and sell the asset in question. Money and credit refer to how easy it is to access funds, whether because of government stimulus, broader societal wealth, or policies that make borrowing cheaper, which make it possible for the bubble to inflate. Speculation is the third and final element and refers to the idea that participants must believe that they can sell what they have purchased to somebody else at a higher price than what they paid for it. This could be a legitimate belief that the asset will appreciate based on intrinsic reasons. But often, it is rooted in the Greater Fool Theory. Even though these are the elements needed in order for a speculative bubble to come about, they almost always require fuel, or a catalyst if you will, in order to take off. Typically, this would be technology or changes in the political environment. I would argue that Bitcoin has experienced both, especially on the technology side. I firmly believe that blockchain technology is revolutionary and will play a big role in society in the long run. Bitcoin enthusiasts obviously believe that as well. Latching on to that, they have leveraged technology like easy trading around the clock, the benefits of blockchain offers, and more, to pump up Bitcoin. More recently, the political environment, at least in the US, has become more favorable to Bitcoin. In 2021, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first Bitcoin futures-based ETF. And in January of last year, they approved a Bitcoin spot ETF that granted investors the opportunity to buy into funds that actually held Bitcoin directly. Under the Trump Administration, the political environment has become even more favorable. In March of this year, Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that would be funded with Bitcoin seized by law enforcement. The Securities and Exchange Commission has dismissed enforcement actions against major companies such as Coinbase ( COIN ) and created a Crypto Task Force while simultaneously wiping out the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team in an effort to soften criminal enforcement in this space. Most recently, Trump signed the GENIUS Act , which provided significant clarity for the use of stablecoins and will certainly further their adoption.

Here Are the Details,"Crypto finance company Matrixport, in its “Chart of the Day” report, emphasized that one of the key factors supporting the Bitcoin (BTC) bull scenario for 2025 is the initial public offering (IPO) preparations of crypto companies. Matrixport: Bitcoin''s 2025 Bull Run Could Be Fueled by IPO Wave According to the report, Wall Street investment banks also want to create a favorable market environment for these IPOs by encouraging BTC prices to remain high. This expectation is no longer just a theory. Numerous crypto companies, including Circle, have filed for IPOs. Matrixport reports that a new crypto company is queuing up for IPO almost every week. This is increasing institutional interest and capital flow into the sector. Sharp Rises in Crypto Stocks The stock performance of crypto-focused companies listed on the stock exchange also supports this interest: MicroStrategy: 47% increase Coinbase: 67% increase Robinhood: 180% increase Circle: A stunning 597% rise These massive price increases reinforce investor confidence and increase IPO excitement and participation in the crypto sector. According to Matrixport, the IPO cycle by crypto firms could prolong the bull market by supporting Bitcoin prices to remain high.

2025-07-22 12:15:23+00:00,EU Gaming Company Fragbite Group Launches Bitcoin Treasury with 4.3 BTC Purchase,"Swedish gaming company Fragbite Group has launched a Bitcoin treasury strategy by purchasing 4.3 Bitcoin at an average price of $112,958 per coin, becoming the latest European firm to adopt cryptocurrency as a primary reserve asset amid a global wave of corporate adoption. The company raised an additional 6 million Swedish krona ($630,000) through an interest-free convertible loan to fund further Bitcoin purchases, with conversion rights triggered if shares exceed the SEK 13 conversion price by 30% for 20 consecutive trading days. Bitcoin Treasury Director Patrik von Bahr called the move positioning Fragbite as “ an early pioneer in a revolutionary industry .” First purchase complete 4.3 bitcoin at an average price of app. USD 112 958 / bitcoin marks the start of operations under the newly established Bitcoin Treasury https://t.co/bwPYv8e2SD $FRAG pic.twitter.com/o2vbP95vAK — Fragbite Group (@FragbiteGroup) July 22, 2025 The acquisition occurs as corporate Bitcoin adoption accelerates globally, with over 274 companies now holding 3.57M Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Most recently, MicroStrategy added 6,220 Bitcoin for $739.8 million during the week ending July 20, bringing total holdings to 607,770 Bitcoin worth over $43 billion. The corporate treasury trend spans multiple sectors and geographies, with Japanese Metaplanet targeting 210,000 Bitcoin by 2027, London-listed companies announcing nine Bitcoin treasury plans in recent weeks , and European firms increasingly viewing cryptocurrency as an inflation hedge and a strategic asset. European Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Gains Momentum Fragbite Group joins a growing number of European companies embracing Bitcoin treasury strategies as regulatory clarity improves across the region. The gaming firm’s convertible loan structure offers flexibility, with no interest accruing until November 30, 2030, and includes forced conversion rights if the shares exceed 200% of the conversion price. Similarly, Swedish firm Refine Group also recently launched a $1 million Bitcoin treasury backed by fresh capital. In comparison, London markets have seen companies like Smarter Web Company surge from £4 million to over £1 billion market value following Bitcoin purchase announcements. The European adoption wave contrasts with established corporate treasury leaders, such as MicroStrategy, which continues to accumulate aggressively through at-the-market equity offerings. The company raised $740.3 million across four ATM programs to fund its latest purchase of 6,220 Bitcoins at an average price of $118,940. Moreover, Australian DigitalX secured $13.54 million from Animoca Brands , UTXO Management, and ParaFi Capital for expanding its Bitcoin treasury, bringing its total assets to $95 million. Market Dynamics Signal Rotation as ETF Flows Diverge Institutions are increasingly flocking to Bitcoin as a treasury, as evidenced by Bitcoin spot ETFs, which recorded their first net outflow in 12 days , with $131.35 million exiting on July 21. Bitcoin spot ETFs saw a $131.35M outflow on July 21, snapping a 12-day inflow streak, while Ethereum ETFs pulled in $297M as investor focus shifted. #SpotBitcoinETF #CryptoETF https://t.co/13rOyhITvN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 22, 2025 This came after over two consecutive weeks of inflows, marking the end of a robust period that had attracted over $6.6 billion since early July. The natural outflow can be primarily attributed to Bitcoin experiencing a slight pullback after its recent $123K ATH peak. BlackRock’s IBIT reported zero net inflow despite holding $86.16 billion in assets, while Ark Invest’s ARKB and Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of $77.46 million and $36.75 million, respectively. However, Ethereum ETFs continued their momentum with $296.59 million in daily inflows, extending their winning streak to 12 consecutive days. BlackRock’s ETHA led with $101.98 million in new capital, while Fidelity’s FETH attracted $126.93 million, as combined Ethereum ETF assets reached $19.6 billion. Notably, SpaceX has recently sparked concern with its $152.85 million Bitcoin transaction after a three-year hiatus. The movement, as speculated, represents potential portfolio restructuring rather than liquidation. The aerospace company’s wallet transferred 1,308.45 Bitcoin, while maintaining 6,977 Bitcoin under Coinbase Prime custody, worth approximately $818.3 million. Historical data shows SpaceX received multiple Bitcoin inflows between 2021 and 2022, with holdings exceeding $1.6 billion during the previous bull run.

2025-07-22 12:15:30+00:00,Bitcoin Takes Center Stage: Kitabo Unveils Bold $5.4M Treasury Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Takes Center Stage: Kitabo Unveils Bold $5.4M Treasury Strategy In a move that’s turning heads across both the traditional financial sector and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world, Kitabo Co., a venerable Japanese textile materials company, has announced its intention to purchase a substantial ¥800 million (approximately $5.4 million) worth of Bitcoin . This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a strategic pivot, signaling a bold new direction for a company rooted in a centuries-old industry. Imagine a textile firm, known for its threads and fabrics, deciding to weave Bitcoin into the very fabric of its financial future. It’s a fascinating development that underscores the evolving perception of digital assets. What’s Driving This Bold Bitcoin Move by Kitabo? The announcement, initially shared by @btcNLNico on X, quickly sent ripples through the financial community. Kitabo Co., with its long-standing history in the Japanese textile sector, is stepping into the digital age in a significant way. Their decision to allocate a considerable portion of their treasury to Bitcoin isn’t arbitrary; it’s a calculated move rooted in a changing global economic landscape. Traditionally, corporate treasuries hold cash, short-term bonds, or other low-risk liquid assets. However, in an era marked by persistent inflation concerns, currency debasement, and ultra-low interest rates in many developed economies, these traditional assets often yield negative real returns. This erodes purchasing power over time. Companies are increasingly seeking alternative assets that can act as a hedge against inflation and offer potential for capital appreciation. For Kitabo, the decision to invest in Bitcoin likely stems from a multi-faceted analysis: Diversification: Spreading risk beyond traditional financial instruments. Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ capable of preserving value against rising costs. Long-Term Growth Potential: Betting on Bitcoin’s continued adoption and price appreciation as a nascent asset class. Innovation & Forward-Thinking: Positioning the company as modern and adaptable to new financial paradigms. This isn’t just about holding a digital asset; it’s about a company, from a traditional industry, acknowledging the shifting tides of global finance and proactively positioning itself for future economic realities. Why Are Companies Embracing Bitcoin for Their Balance Sheets? Kitabo is certainly making headlines, but they are not the first. The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets has been gaining momentum over the past few years, pioneered by companies like MicroStrategy and, famously for a period, Tesla. What makes Bitcoin an attractive, albeit unconventional, treasury asset for these diverse enterprises? Here are some compelling reasons that drive corporate Bitcoin adoption: A Hedge Against Inflation: With central banks globally engaging in quantitative easing and governments increasing spending, many fear a devaluation of fiat currencies. Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it inherently scarce, leading many to view it as a superior store of value compared to traditional currencies. Companies see it as a way to protect their capital from erosion. Digital Gold Narrative: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with the precious metal, such as scarcity and global acceptance. In times of economic uncertainty or geopolitical instability, investors and now corporations, look for safe-haven assets outside the traditional financial system. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Relying solely on cash or low-yielding bonds can be risky in a volatile economic climate. Adding Bitcoin introduces a new asset class with a low correlation to traditional markets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Potential for Significant Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable long-term growth. Companies are willing to take on some short-term price fluctuations for the potential of substantial long-term gains, which could significantly boost their financial reserves. Attracting Talent and Investors: Being an early adopter or an innovative player in the crypto space can enhance a company’s brand image. It can signal to tech-savvy talent and investors that the company is forward-thinking and adaptable, potentially attracting new capital and human resources. Future-Proofing Business Models: As the world becomes increasingly digital, integrating cryptocurrencies might be seen as a necessary step for future business operations, whether for payments, supply chain management, or other blockchain-enabled functionalities. These factors collectively paint a picture of why companies, from software firms to textile manufacturers, are re-evaluating their treasury strategies and considering Bitcoin as a legitimate, if unconventional, asset.

In the next section, we will review their insights and answer the question of when Bitcoin will hit $1 million. And after that, we will take a look at a new crypto coin, attracting global interest and creating a wave of its own. Bitcoin price prediction: when will BTC hit $1 million? At press time, Bitcoin has pulled back slightly to $118,000, but still commands a dominant 59.95% share of the market, totaling $2.37 trillion in market cap. Despite the pause, investor sentiment remains bullish and AI models are projecting the momentum from fresh ETF inflows to sustain its growth in the next 12–24 months. Analysts affirm that recent consolidation is a healthy one, as some traders and investors have trimmed profits following Bitcoin’s climb past 120K. According to them, recent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs now record six consecutive weeks of net additions surpassing $10 billion. A sign that confirms institutional interest hasn’t dwindled. Google Gemini’s model, trained on market momentum, projects that if inflows continue at this pace, Bitcoin price prediction will remain bullish in the long term and the asset could test $200K by early 2026. The model predicts a possible stretch target of $1 million by 2029, assuming diminishing sell pressure and macroeconomic conditions remain favourable. Meanwhile, OpenAI’s ChatGPT suggests a shorter timeline for the asset in Bitcoin price prediction, especially if it breaks past $130K in the coming weeks. In a high-demand scenario with sustained global adoption and regulatory clarity, BTC could sell above $1 million sometimes between 2027 and 2028. Remittix (RTX): exploring a trillion-dollar industry Remittix is a next-gen PayFi protocol focused on solving the biggest bottlenecks in cross-border payments such as: high fees, slow settlements and lack of direct crypto-to-fiat conversion tools. AI models like ChatGPT and Google Gemini are forecasting that RTX could rally up to 20× before year-end, rivaling even the best-performing Layer 1s. The reason? Its unique DeFi capabilities and mass market appeal. Both AI-models highlight the following as bullish indicators for the new crypto gem: Closes a trillion-dollar market gap. Backed by a working and audited infrastructure. Whale accumulation and continued market traction. PayFi API & merchant tools: Businesses can now accept crypto and receive instant local bank deposits. Multi-asset support: Remittix lets users convert BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL and 40+ cryptos directly into fiat, a major breakthrough for real crypto utility. Real-world relevance: For freelancers and remote workers, Remittix removes the need for expensive middlemen; now instant settlements will be feasible.

2025-07-22 12:25:24+00:00,BNB Holdings Soar: Nano Labs’ Astounding $90M Strategic Boost in Web 3.0,"BitcoinWorld BNB Holdings Soar: Nano Labs’ Astounding $90M Strategic Boost in Web 3.0 The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant developments, and a recent announcement from Nasdaq-listed Web 3.0 infrastructure provider, Nano Labs Ltd, has certainly captured attention. In a bold move that underscores growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Nano Labs has substantially increased its BNB holdings , transforming its strategic reserve with a massive injection of capital. What’s Behind Nano Labs’ Astounding Increase in BNB Holdings ? Nano Labs Ltd, a prominent player in the Web 3.0 space, recently made waves with its announcement via a Globe Newswire press release: the company has boosted its BNB holdings to an impressive 120,000 tokens. This significant accumulation, valued at approximately $90 million, is not merely a speculative investment but a calculated component of its long-term strategic reserve plan. But what exactly does this entail for a company operating at the forefront of Web 3.0 innovation? This strategic move by Nano Labs reflects a growing trend among tech-forward companies to diversify their treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies. For Nano Labs, integrating a substantial amount of BNB into its reserves could serve multiple purposes: Balance Sheet Strength: Holding a liquid and widely recognized digital asset like BNB can enhance the company’s financial stability and liquidity, especially within the volatile yet opportunity-rich crypto ecosystem. Ecosystem Alignment: BNB is the native cryptocurrency of the Binance ecosystem, which includes the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), a vital platform for many Web 3.0 applications. Increasing BNB holdings might signal a deeper alignment or future integration with this expansive ecosystem. Strategic Flexibility: A substantial BNB reserve provides Nano Labs with greater flexibility for future investments, partnerships, or even operational expenses within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0 sectors. Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation, digital assets are increasingly viewed as potential hedges against the devaluation of fiat currencies, offering a different kind of stability. This decision is a testament to Nano Labs’ forward-thinking approach, positioning itself not just as a builder of Web 3.0 infrastructure but also as a significant participant in its underlying economy. Understanding the Power of BNB Holdings in the Web 3.0 Landscape To fully grasp the magnitude of Nano Labs’ decision, it’s essential to understand BNB itself. BNB, originally launched as Binance Coin, is far more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s the foundational token of the Binance ecosystem, one of the largest and most influential in the blockchain world. Its utility extends across various facets, including: Transaction Fees: Used to pay for transaction fees on Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain. Staking and Governance: Holders can stake BNB to secure the network and participate in governance decisions. Discounts: Offers discounts on trading fees on the Binance exchange. Launchpad Access: Provides access to token sales on the Binance Launchpad, a platform for new crypto projects. Ecosystem Growth: Fuels a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs built on the Binance Smart Chain. Nano Labs’ significant accumulation of BNB isn’t just about holding a digital asset; it’s about embedding themselves deeper into an ecosystem that is central to the very infrastructure they are building. Their increased BNB holdings can be seen as a strategic bet on the continued growth and dominance of the Binance ecosystem within the broader Web 3.0 paradigm. What Are the Potential Benefits for Nano Labs and the Market from These Elevated BNB Holdings ? The implications of Nano Labs’ move extend beyond its balance sheet, potentially sending positive signals throughout the cryptocurrency market and, specifically, the Web 3.0 sector. Let’s explore some key benefits: For Nano Labs: Enhanced Credibility: As a Nasdaq-listed entity, a public declaration of substantial BNB holdings lends significant credibility to digital assets as legitimate corporate treasury assets. This can inspire confidence among traditional investors who might be hesitant about crypto. Operational Synergies: With significant BNB reserves, Nano Labs might find it easier to engage in partnerships, joint ventures, or even acquisitions within the Binance ecosystem, fostering closer ties and operational efficiencies. Future-Proofing: By aligning with a robust and evolving blockchain ecosystem, Nano Labs is arguably future-proofing its operations and strategic direction in a rapidly digitizing world. For the Market and BNB: Increased Demand and Stability: A large-scale institutional purchase like this directly contributes to BNB’s demand, potentially influencing its price stability and overall market capitalization.

2025-07-22 12:26:07+00:00,Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Support: Can It Rise To $130K?,"The post Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Support: Can It Rise To $130K? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After surging to a new all-time high of $123,231 on July 14th, the Bitcoin price has started to cool down due to exhaustion in strength. As of writing, it is consolidating around the $116,000 to $120,000 range, which has turned down to a zone that has become a battleground for short-term sentiment. Meanwhile, when writing, the bulls in intraday have pushed BTC 1.34% to trade at $119,018 with $74.46 billion 24-hour volume and $2.37 trillion market cap. Now, traders and analysts are intrigued for BTC’s next move and are watching closely to find out whether this is a healthy retest or the beginning of a deeper correction. Rising Exchange Reserves Hint at Selling Pressure A primary concern right now is the increase in Bitcoin exchange reserves , which have risen to their highest point since late June. Per CryptoQuant insights , this uptick often signals that traders are moving coins onto exchanges to sell. This signifies a short-term profit-taking phase. However, the data isn’t entirely bearish. Despite growing reserves, overall inflows remain low when compared to peak periods earlier in the year. This implies that although some selling is occurring, it hasn’t reached levels that typically precede larger market downturns. This clearly suggests that retailers are offloading, and giants are absorbing it. Institutional Flows and Long-Term Holders Stay Committed At the same time, long-term on-chain signals remain constructive with the ETF data mostly green in July, with a cumulative total net inflow of $54.62 billion. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor keeps on accumulating, and other firms are also buying it. These steady inflows highlight sustained interest from large capital allocators, even as retail traders are realizing their gains. Analyst Finds $116K–$116.4K Zone As Crucial Technically, the Bitcoin price has been mostly trading in a range near $116K to $120K range in the past couple of days, where $116K to $116.4 is seen as critical immediate support, identified by a CryptoQuant analyst. Also, the recent intraday rise in BTC was observed from the same level. If the momentum is building again and manages to flip range high of $120K, then in the short term $125 and $130K would be the near-term targets. But if consolidation in the current range continues, then immediate support needs to hold the momentum for the BTC price. On the other hand, if BTC breaks below $116K with volume, it opens the door for a steeper retracement, potentially to $112K or even $110K. Analysts suggest that the bullish thesis remains valid as long as this $110K level isn’t breached.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/bitcoin-price-faces-critical-support-can-it-rise-to-130k/,BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|MARKET,Price Analysis|Bitcoin|Crypto news,BTC,"Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Support: Can It Rise To $130K?.

Liu explained that this movement was a “natural pause” after an aggressive rally and should be seen as an institutional rebalancing rather than fear-based selling. The pullback happened on the heels of record-breaking inflows earlier in July where Bitcoin ETFs saw back-to-back billion-dollar days on July 10 and 11.

2025-07-22 12:33:59+00:00,Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest Shifts to Ethereum Treasury Bet with Tom Lee’s Bitmine,"Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest is shifting sharply toward Ethereum through a significant investment in Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the Ethereum treasury firm chaired by Fundstrat’s Tom Lee. The move, disclosed in ARK’s daily trading update on Monday, marks the first time Wood’s funds have purchased Bitmine shares since the firm announced its strategic shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum in late June. ARK’s Innovation ETF (ARKK), Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW), and Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) sold 218,986 shares of Coinbase (COIN) worth around $90.5 million and 463,293 shares of gaming company Roblox (RBLX) worth $57.7 million to fund the pivot. Simultaneously, the three funds purchased 4.4 million shares of Bitmine, valued at approximately $174 million, representing 1.5% of each ETF’s portfolio. Betting on Bitmine’s Ethereum Pivot Bitmine Immersion Technologies has seen its stock surge over 3,000% to a record high of $135 on July 3 following its announcement to switch its treasury strategy from Bitcoin to Ether. Although the price has since corrected to around $39.57, the stock remains up over 400% since the start of 2025, attracting notable investors including billionaire Peter Thiel, who recently acquired a 9.1% stake. For ARK Invest, the move aligns with its thesis of backing “disruptive innovation,” as Bitmine’s Ethereum pivot positions it to potentially capitalize on the growing institutional and developer interest around Ethereum, staking, and tokenization. This purchase also comes as ARK’s funds adjust positions in other firms, shifting shares from Robinhood and Block Inc. toward Bitmine and select tech firms like AMD, DoorDash, and Airbnb. ARK Invest Funds Realign Crypto and Fintech Holdings The ARKK fund, with $6.8 billion in assets under management, remains heavily weighted toward Tesla (9.7%), while Coinbase and Roblox still sit as its second and third largest holdings. It also holds a 5% position in stablecoin issuer Circle . The ARKW fund, which manages $2 billion with a focus on shifting technologies, continues to hold Robinhood, Coinbase, and Tesla as its top three, alongside minor stakes in Meta, Shopify, and Amazon. Meanwhile, the $1.2 billion ARKF fintech-themed fund, which includes Robinhood, Coinbase, Circle, Block, eToro, and PayPal , is currently the only ARK Invest fund with indirect Ethereum exposure, holding a 1.15% position in the 3IQ Ether Staking ETF. The fund also sold 225,742 shares of the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) on July 16, signaling ARK’s deeper pivot toward Ethereum while recalibrating its broader crypto strategy to align with evolving market dynamics.

2025-07-22 12:37:55+00:00,"Ethereum ETF Hype Builds, But Bitcoin Solaris Genesis Event at $1 Offers More Accessible Wealth Potential","The post Ethereum ETF Hype Builds, But Bitcoin Solaris Genesis Event at $1 Offers More Accessible Wealth Potential appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News It feels like every week brings a fresh wave of crypto headlines shouting about institutional money. This week’s star? Ethereum ETFs. Sure, it is exciting. Wall Street finally giving Ethereum its shiny badge of legitimacy is no small feat. But while institutional investors fight over who gets to stack ETH first, everyday users are asking a different question: where can I actually build wealth in crypto without needing a hedge fund behind me? The answer may surprise you. It is not Ethereum. It is Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) and its Genesis Event. Why Bitcoin Solaris Could Be the Smarter Play Let’s get this out of the way. Ethereum is still a powerhouse. Its smart contracts and DeFi reach are unmatched. But at its current valuation, ETH is not exactly offering that early-stage, life-changing potential anymore. Buying Ethereum now feels a bit like arriving late to a buffet; you still get food, but the best plates are gone. Bitcoin Solaris , however, is serving something fresh. BTC-S combines the familiarity of Bitcoin with the speed, scalability, and energy efficiency that Ethereum investors wish ETH had out of the box. This hybrid chain isn’t promising the moon without substance. It is already delivering on performance through its dual-consensus architecture and blazing-fast transaction speeds. The Core of BTC-S Power At its heart, Bitcoin Solaris is a technological beast designed for the modern age. Its hybrid consensus model merges Proof-of-Work for security and Delegated Proof-of-Stake for scalability and efficiency. This design enables Bitcoin Solaris to achieve up to 10,000 transactions per second with 2-second finality, leaving older chains gasping for air. Base Layer: Classic PoW for rock-solid security, compatible with existing Bitcoin mining rigs. Solaris Layer: DPoS for lightning-fast smart contract execution and validator rotation. Cross-layer synchronization ensures seamless integrity between layers. And it is all energy-efficient, consuming 99.95% less energy than Bitcoin mining. Think of it as Bitcoin’s smarter, younger sibling who learned from big brother’s mistakes. The upcoming Solaris Nova App will make this power available right from your pocket, transforming mobile devices into fully operational mining hubs. It is a bold step toward democratizing blockchain participation, where anyone can contribute and earn without expensive hardware. Presale Frenzy: Why Everyone Is Watching BTC-S Now Bitcoin Solaris is closing in on the finish line for its presale. Phase 13 is currently live with tokens priced at $13. The launch price is $20, meaning early adopters are eyeing a solid ROI. Presale runs for only 90 days and it is almost over. Only around 1 week remains until the curtain drops on what is already one of the most explosive and shortest presales in the space. Over $7.7M+ raised and 15,800+ unique users onboard reflect the momentum behind BTC-S. But here’s the twist. Bitcoin Solaris is introducing a Price Rollback for a very limited time through its Genesis Event, a promotional window where early participants can purchase BTC-S at $1 instead of $13. This is not just a price cut. It is a calculated strategy to reward believers before liftoff. The potential ROI here? A staggering 1900%. This rare opportunity underscores how serious BTC-S is about onboarding as many as possible ahead of its major launch. Opportunities like this do not come around often. Especially not with a project this technically sound. Why Wait Years for Gains When BTC-S Is Moving Now To receive your tokens on launch day, wallets like Trust Wallet and Metamask are recommended for seamless delivery. Audited. Trusted. Ready. Security is a non-negotiable in crypto. Bitcoin Solaris backs up its bold promises with third-party validation. Audits from Cyberscope and Freshcoins confirm the robustness of BTC-S smart contracts and protocols. The community is growing fast, with daily discussions happening on Telegram and X . These are not just numbers; they are real people sharing insights, strategies, and excitement about what Bitcoin Solaris is building. Why This Technology Matters for Real Wealth Building Bitcoin Solaris is not about gimmicks. It is about sustainable wealth creation through accessibility and performance. Mining is no longer confined to tech geeks with warehouses of GPUs. Thanks to the upcoming Solaris Nova App, anyone with a phone can mine BTC-S. This means broader adoption, stronger network security, and, yes, more earning potential. Key strengths fueling BTC-S wealth potential: Universal mining from smartphones, laptops, and rigs. Cross-chain integrations for rapid adoption. Rust-based smart contracts powering real DeFi applications. Fixed supply of 21 million tokens, scarcity driving long-term value.

2025-07-22 12:40:24+00:00,Bitcoin Data Center Unleashes Massive $20M Texas Expansion for Soluna,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Data Center Unleashes Massive $20M Texas Expansion for Soluna The world of digital finance is constantly evolving, with Bitcoin leading the charge as a decentralized store of value. But behind every transaction and every new block mined lies a complex, energy-intensive infrastructure. This is where companies like Soluna Holdings come into play, building the backbone of the digital economy. In a remarkable stride forward, Soluna has just secured a substantial $20 million investment from Spring Lane Capital, earmarked for a significant expansion of its Project Kati Bitcoin data center facility in Texas. This isn’t just about more mining rigs; it’s about scaling sustainable infrastructure and positioning for the future of both cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence. Soluna’s Vision: Powering the Future of Bitcoin Data Centers in Texas Soluna Holdings isn’t just another player in the Bitcoin mining space; they are pioneers in developing sustainable Bitcoin data center and AI-focused infrastructure. Their recent $20 million funding round, spearheaded by Spring Lane Capital, underscores a shared vision for efficient, environmentally conscious digital asset operations. This substantial capital injection is specifically allocated to accelerate the expansion of their Project Kati facility, a cornerstone of their operations situated strategically in Texas. The expansion is ambitious, targeting an additional 35 megawatts (MW) of capacity. To put that into perspective, 35 MW can power a small town, but for Soluna, it translates into the ability to host approximately 12,000 next-generation mining rigs. These aren’t your average home setups; these are state-of-the-art machines designed for maximum efficiency and computational power. The meticulous planning is evident in their timeline: construction is slated to commence in Q3 2025, with full operational status anticipated by Q1 2026. This phased approach allows for careful resource allocation and integration, ensuring a smooth transition to increased capacity. What makes this partnership particularly compelling is its longevity. Soluna’s collaboration with Spring Lane Capital is not new; it’s an ongoing relationship built on trust and a proven track record. This continued backing from a reputable investment firm specializing in sustainable infrastructure speaks volumes about Soluna’s operational integrity and long-term potential. It’s a testament to their commitment to building robust, future-proof Bitcoin data center solutions. Why Texas? The Strategic Advantage for Bitcoin Mining Operations The choice of Texas as the primary location for Soluna’s expanded Bitcoin data center operations is far from arbitrary; it’s a calculated strategic move. The Lone Star State has rapidly emerged as a global hub for large-scale Bitcoin mining, and for good reason. Its unique energy landscape offers a compelling blend of advantages that are hard to find elsewhere. Firstly, Texas boasts a deregulated energy market, which fosters competition among power providers. This often translates into more competitive electricity prices, a critical factor for energy-intensive operations like Bitcoin mining. Furthermore, Texas is a powerhouse in renewable energy, particularly wind and solar. This abundance of clean energy sources aligns perfectly with Soluna’s commitment to sustainable operations, allowing them to tap into greener power grids and potentially reduce their carbon footprint. This focus on renewable energy is increasingly important for companies aiming to meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Secondly, the state’s grid operator, ERCOT (Electric Reliability Council of Texas), has shown a willingness to work with large energy consumers, including Bitcoin miners, through programs like demand response. This means miners can agree to curtail their operations during peak demand times or when the grid is under stress, in exchange for incentives. This flexibility not only benefits the grid but can also provide cost savings for the mining facilities. It’s a symbiotic relationship that supports grid stability while enabling large-scale industrial operations. Finally, Texas has cultivated a generally welcoming regulatory environment for cryptocurrency businesses. While regulations are always evolving, the state has positioned itself as forward-thinking in its approach to blockchain and digital assets, attracting significant investment and innovation in the sector. This combination of affordable, abundant, and increasingly green energy, coupled with a supportive regulatory climate, makes Texas an undeniable magnet for advanced Bitcoin data center infrastructure development.

This comes as the cryptocurrency consolidates to cool off from the latest rally. The intensity of profit-taking from LTHs raises speculation that the market may have reached a peak for this cycle. However, Gaah, a pseudonymous analyst at the market intelligence platform CryptoQuant, believes the top is not yet in. LTHs Take Profits According to Gaah, the LTH Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) has climbed to its highest level in 2025. The indicator has passed the mid-range, but remains below the red zone, which has marked cycle tops in past bull markets. The SOPR’s current level indicates that LTHs have increased their selling activities, taking more profit, but not at excessive levels. Gaah said the market usually sees such high levels during periods of euphoria and mass distribution. This further suggests that the market has not yet reached its peak, despite bitcoin’s rally past $123,000. Analyzing past data, market experts see macro top signals when the LTH SOPR rises to a level above 4.0. The metric is currently slightly above 2.5, supporting the belief that there is room for further price appreciation before the market reaches overheated levels. “This behavior indicates a heated market, but still far from a final top. Investors should monitor the continuation of this trend as a sign of the cycle’s maturation, without ignoring the risks of significant corrections along the way,” Gaah added. Whale Inflows to Exchanges Rise Meanwhile, the surge in LTH profit-taking is evident in flows from Bitcoin whales to crypto exchanges. A previous report revealed that the monthly average of whale inflows has increased by approximately $17 billion, from $28 billion to $ 45 billion. The market witnessed this growth between July 14 and 18, around the time BTC touched $123,000 for the first time. The increase in flows to exchanges reflects the transfer of at least 80,000 BTC, as whales scramble to lock in profits. Analysts say Bitcoin’s outlook remains bullish, but with a slight fragility in the near term. This could be further exacerbated by continued profit-taking by whales, LTHs, and even retail investors. Fortunately, CryptoQuant also found a decline in daily whale inflows to exchanges, suggesting that selling pressure is easing. Regardless, BTC could either consolidate or face a deeper correction before its next leg up.

Expert Says XRP Beats Bitcoin And Ethereum Right Now It was the 14th straight week of positive flows, lifting year‑to‑date inflows to $27 billion and driving total assets under management to a fresh high of $220 billion. Trading also heated up: exchange‑traded product turnover hit nearly $40 billion in a single week, underscoring a surge in both interest and liquidity. Record Inflows Hit New High Last week’s $4.40 billion haul wasn’t just a marginal uptick. It smashed the old record by $120 million. Investors have now pumped capital into these funds every week since early April, showing a clear shift toward digital assets as part of broader portfolios. Last week digital asset products saw all-time high weekly inflows of US$4.39bn, bringing YTD inflows to US$27bn, pushing AuM to a record US$220bn. Ethereum attracted a record US$2.12bn in inflows, while Bitcoin saw inflows of US$2.2bn. https://t.co/y32mEP8Oa2 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 21, 2025 Total AUM of $220 billion means these products now rival many traditional asset classes in sheer scale. And with $39 billion in weekly turnover, bid‑ask spreads are likely tighter—making it easier for big players to move in and out without major price swings. Ethereum Leads The Charge Based on reports, Ethereum was the standout draw. It pulled in a little over $2 billion—nearly double its previous weekly high of $1.2 billion. Over the past week, ether climbed 24.5%, briefly topping $3,800 for the first time in more than seven months. That price pop clearly caught buyers’ eyes. Bitcoin stayed strong too, with $2 billion in inflows, even if that was down from $2.7 billion the week before. Notably, ETPs made up 55% of Bitcoin’s total exchange volume, signaling that institutions are hunting exposure via these regulated vehicles.

2025-07-22 13:00:24+00:00,Pioneering Crypto Payments: Skycorp Solar’s Strategic Leap into Digital Assets and Ethereum Investment,"BitcoinWorld Pioneering Crypto Payments: Skycorp Solar’s Strategic Leap into Digital Assets and Ethereum Investment In a significant move that bridges the gap between traditional industry and the burgeoning digital economy, Skycorp Solar Group, a Nasdaq-listed powerhouse in renewable energy, has announced a groundbreaking shift. Starting August 1st, this innovative company will begin accepting crypto payments for its international transactions, embracing leading digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDC, and USDT. This isn’t just about facilitating transactions; it’s a strategic declaration of intent, further solidified by their plan to invest a portion of their cash and renewable energy returns directly into Ethereum. This bold step positions Skycorp Solar at the forefront of corporate crypto adoption, signaling a transformative era where sustainable energy meets decentralized finance. The Dawn of Digital Transactions: Why is Skycorp Solar Embracing Crypto Payments ? Skycorp Solar Group (ticker: PN) has made headlines with its decision to accept Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDC, and USDT for international transactions. This move, effective August 1st, is more than just a nod to technological trends; it’s a calculated strategy to enhance efficiency, broaden market reach, and align with the evolving global financial landscape. But what exactly drives a established solar energy company to pivot towards digital currencies? Global Accessibility: Traditional banking systems can be slow and costly for international transfers. Crypto payments offer a faster, often cheaper alternative, enabling Skycorp Solar to serve a wider global clientele with greater ease. Reduced Transaction Costs: For large international transactions, bank fees can accumulate. Cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins like USDC and USDT, can significantly lower these overheads, directly impacting the company’s bottom line. Enhanced Transparency and Security: Blockchain technology, the backbone of cryptocurrencies, provides an immutable and transparent ledger for all transactions, potentially reducing fraud and increasing trust in cross-border dealings. Innovation and Market Leadership: By adopting crypto payments , Skycorp Solar positions itself as a forward-thinking leader in both the renewable energy and financial sectors, appealing to a tech-savvy investor and customer base. A Strategic Bet on Ethereum: What Drives Skycorp Solar’s Investment Vision? Beyond accepting digital currencies for payments, Skycorp Solar has revealed an even bolder strategy: investing a portion of its cash reserves and renewable energy returns directly into Ethereum. This isn’t a casual dabble; it reflects a long-term belief in Ethereum’s potential as a foundational technology for the future of finance and decentralized applications. Ethereum, often considered the backbone of Web3, powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and smart contracts. Skycorp Solar’s investment could be driven by several factors: Diversification of Assets: Investing in a high-growth digital asset like Ethereum can provide a hedge against inflation and diversify the company’s treasury beyond traditional fiat currencies. Belief in Decentralized Technologies: This move signals Skycorp Solar’s conviction in the long-term viability and transformative power of blockchain and decentralized networks. Potential for Capital Appreciation: As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow and evolve, particularly with upgrades like Ethereum 2.0 (now the Merge and subsequent updates), the value of ETH could appreciate significantly, benefiting Skycorp Solar’s financial health. Synergy with Sustainability: While Bitcoin has faced criticism for its energy consumption, Ethereum’s shift to Proof-of-Stake has dramatically reduced its energy footprint, aligning more closely with Skycorp Solar’s core business of renewable energy. This makes it a more palatable and strategically sound investment from an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) perspective. Beyond Convenience: What are the Core Benefits of Crypto Payments for Global Enterprises? Skycorp Solar’s decision highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking companies. Embracing crypto payments offers a suite of advantages that can streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and unlock new revenue streams. For businesses operating on a global scale, these benefits are particularly pronounced: Instant Global Reach: Cryptocurrencies transcend geographical boundaries and traditional banking hours. A transaction initiated in New York can be settled almost instantly in Tokyo, removing delays inherent in conventional international transfers. Lower Processing Fees: Compared to credit card processing fees, which can range from 1.5% to 3.5% or more, cryptocurrency transaction fees are often significantly lower, especially for larger sums.

2025-07-22 13:00:56+00:00,Figma looks to raise $1 billion at $16 billion valuation in IPO filing,"The San Francisco-based design software company filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $1 billion and secure a valuation of roughly $16.5 billion on a fully diluted basis. According to the IPO prospectus submitted Monday, Figma and its investors plan to offer nearly 40 million shares priced between $25 and $28 each. If the share price is at the top of that range, the company could raise slightly over $1 billion. Figma disclosed earlier this month that it holds over $69 million in Bitcoin via ETFs, and USDC reserves worth $30 million, all bought in March. IPO filing spells valuation of over $16 billion The prospectus noted that on a fully diluted basis, which accounted for employee stock options and restricted shares, Figma’s valuation would reach approximately $16.5 billion. Its market capitalization would reach $13.6 billion based solely on outstanding shares The company’s IPO is expected to be priced by the end of the month, according to a source familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Co., and JPMorgan Chase will lead the offering. Figma plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “FIG.” According to the IPO filing, Figma generated $228 million in revenue during the first quarter of 2025 and posted a net income of $45 million. Despite reporting a net loss of $732 million in 2024, the company said the shortfall was caused by a one-time tax-related expense tied to an employee stock tender offer. The software company listed new members on its board of directors, including Mike Krieger, Instagram’s co-founder and Chief Product Officer at AI company Anthropic . He will join the board alongside Luis von Ahn, co-founder and CEO of language-learning platform Duolingo. Founder and CEO Dylan Field is still the largest individual shareholder, holding 56.6 million Class B shares, which grant him 51.1% of the company’s voting power. In a letter to investors, Field asserted that the IPO is imperative for the company and its user community. “ It’s time for Figma to buck the trend of amazing companies staying private indefinitely ,” Field wrote, citing benefits such as liquidity, corporate transparency, and ownership among the reasons for going public. Away from the IPO details, Figma also authorized the issuance of “blockchain common stock” via blockchain-based tokens. Still, it said there are currently no plans to issue these shares yet. During the second quarter, the company added new clients and expanded its operating margin to between 4% and 5%, up from 3% in the same quarter last year. Tech firms open to public listing Technology institutions, particularly those backed by venture capitalists, are reportedly now more open to joining the public market. Some investors were disconcerted about buying stocks under President Donald Trump’s tariffs and protectionist policies, worried they could further delay listings from companies like Klarna and Stripe. The public debut of CoreWeave in March helped change the sentiment around tariffs and their effect on the US economy. The data center operator lowered its valuation to go public but has since seen its stock surge over 200%, hitting a market capitalization of nearly $63 billion. Other tech institutions disputed that public listings could be looking at how Figma’s offering evolves. If successful, several high-profile startups that have been privately held for years due to market volatility and high interest rates might consider offering shares on public stock exchanges.

This integration allows users in Brazil to hold BRL in their KuCoin accounts, deposit and withdraw funds using the PIX instant payment system or bank transfers, and directly trade major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Tether (USDT) without the need for currency conversions. The return of BRL support is fully aligned with the Central Bank of Brazil’s Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations, ensuring that users can trade in a secure and compliant environment. By removing currency conversion fees, KuCoin enhances cost efficiency, a notable benefit in a region where digital assets are frequently used to hedge against economic volatility. The availability of PIX streamlines deposit and withdrawal processes, enabling real-time fund transfers and improving market responsiveness for traders. KuCoin launches promotional campaign for Brazilian users To celebrate the resumption of BRL services, KuCoin has launched a range of promotional offers aimed at incentivizing user participation and rewarding engagement. These include a Top-Up Ranking Contest, where the top 10 users who deposit the most BRL will share a prize pool of 2,050 USDT. Additionally, users can receive up to 10 USDT through the Large Purchase Bonus by making qualifying crypto purchases with BRL. First-time BRL crypto buyers are eligible for a 1 USDT bonus under the New User First Purchase Gift. Moreover, new users can enjoy fee-free BRL deposits and withdrawals for the first month as part of the New User 0 Fees promotion. These limited-time incentives aim to accelerate adoption and ease the onboarding process for new users, particularly those without access to foreign currency accounts. KuCoin’s initiative also reinforces its commitment to making crypto accessible to a broader audience in Brazil. Commitment to Brazil’s expanding crypto market KuCoin CEO BC Wong emphasized the strategic importance of Latin America, stating: “Latin America is a vital market for KuCoin, and our commitment remains unwavering. We are dedicated to providing Brazilian traders with an exceptional trading experience.” Wong also highlighted KuCoin’s pioneering role as the first major exchange to support BRL transfers via PIX following Brazil’s Central Bank policy changes in 2022. Brazil is currently ranked ninth globally in terms of crypto market size, with net crypto imports reaching $4.69 billion in Q1 2024, a 118% year-over-year increase. The market is characterized by a high volume of stablecoin transactions, reflecting users’ desire for financial stability amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Projections estimate that Brazil’s crypto market will generate $2.8 billion in revenue by 2025, supported by a favorable regulatory climate and growing mainstream adoption.

According to Master Ananda’s outlook, the ongoing rally marks the start of a much larger bullish cycle. He noted that while Solana’s recovery may feel gradual, the move from the April 7 low to July 21, just 98 days, is relatively quick, as he explained in a TradingView post on July 21. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView With an all-time high of $295, Ananda believes resistance will be cleared with ease, similar to Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) recent breakout, which culminated in a record high above $123,000. The expert now expects Solana to reach $420 in the mid-term, with $620 and $1,000 as potential upside targets in the current bull market. Notably, a rally to $1,000 would mark a 400% gain from current levels. Technically, Solana recently broke out of a long-term bullish consolidation, clearing a triangle pattern that formed between April and June 2025. SOL next price levels to watch SOL is now trading above the 55-day EMA, 144-day EMA, and 200-week MA, confirming a strong trend reversal. Fibonacci extension levels point to upside targets at $252.91, $419.78, $620.35, and $1,021.49. Ananda attributed the aggressive price targets to Solana’s broader market cycle. In this line, the sharp 60% correction in January 2025 likely marked the bottom, setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. To this end, the expert compared Solana’s structure to Bitcoin’s, suggesting that after a new high, SOL is more likely to consolidate and continue higher than to crash. At the same time, strong on-chain metrics are also fueling Solana’s momentum. Notably, the asset reclaimed the $200 level as Open Interest hit a record $11.03 billion on July 21, up from $9.52 billion just days earlier, according to Coinglass . SOL open interest chart.

Fibonacci extension levels point to upside targets at $252.91, $419.78, $620.35, and $1,021.49. Ananda attributed the aggressive price targets to Solana’s broader market cycle. In this line, the sharp 60% correction in January 2025 likely marked the bottom, setting the stage for a renewed uptrend. To this end, the expert compared Solana’s structure to Bitcoin’s, suggesting that after a new high, SOL is more likely to consolidate and continue higher than to crash. At the same time, strong on-chain metrics are also fueling Solana’s momentum. Notably, the asset reclaimed the $200 level as Open Interest hit a record $11.03 billion on July 21, up from $9.52 billion just days earlier, according to Coinglass . SOL open interest chart.

Solana price analysis At press time, Solana was trading at $200.43, up nearly 5% in the last 24 hours and 25% over the past week. SOL seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold As it stands, Solana is trading well above its 50-day ($155.95) and 200-day ($152.29) simple moving averages, reinforcing the bullish structure. However, the 14-day RSI at 79.04 suggests overbought conditions, potentially hinting at a short-term pullback or consolidation.

2025-07-22 13:10:02+00:00,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Key Factors Point to a BTC Correction Ahead,"Bitcoin has entered a sideways corrective phase, with investors taking profits and rotating capital into the altcoin market. As BTC cools off, the stage may be set for a potential altcoin rally in the coming days. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart After facing strong resistance at the $123K level, Bitcoin has entered a corrective phase, likely driven by profit-taking and distribution among investors. Historically, when BTC cools down at its all-time high prices, capital often rotates into altcoins, sparking rallies across the broader market. Currently, a pullback toward the key 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone, located between $107K and $111K, appears likely before the next major bullish impulse. Until then, a period of consolidation is expected, potentially accompanied by notable strength in altcoins. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin’s consolidation is forming a descending wedge pattern, a structure that typically signals bullish continuation. The price is now approaching a crucial support zone between $113K and $116K, aligning with the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels. If this zone successfully holds and triggers a breakout above the wedge, a move back toward the $123K resistance becomes likely. However, if support fails, a deeper correction toward the $111K level may unfold. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets Bitcoin has seen its largest net inflow to exchanges since July 2024, marking a key shift in on-chain dynamics. Such inflows suggest increased distribution and profit-taking, as more BTC becomes available for trading. Historically, similar exchange inflow spikes have often preceded deeper corrections. This week’s data hints that major players, potentially funds or institutions, are offloading BTC near all-time highs, managing their risk exposure. However, this capital rotation could also fuel an altcoin rally, with demand flowing into alternative assets. As exchange supply rises, market volatility may increase, especially during demand surges. Traders should keep a close eye on this metric, as it could foreshadow the next major move.

2025-07-22 13:11:22+00:00,"Tron (TRX) Sees Whale Exit, Funds Moving to High-Yield Presale With 3000% Target","The post Tron (TRX) Sees Whale Exit, Funds Moving to High-Yield Presale With 3000% Target appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a surprising move, several large holders of Tron (TRX) have begun exiting their positions, signalling a shift of capital away from the once-dominant blockchain. These whale movements have sparked curiosity in the crypto community about where these significant funds will land next. Emerging as a clear favorite among sophisticated investors is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new decentralized finance platform offering a compelling real-yield lending ecosystem that is quietly gearing up for explosive growth. While Tron (TRX) whales pull back, the smart money is positioning itself in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale, eyeing a remarkable 3000% upside potential by 2026. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Dual Lending Model: Real-Yield Opportunities for Diverse Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to distinguish itself with a unique two-pronged lending system aimed at a broad spectrum of crypto holders. The first path, Peer-to-Contract (P2C), will target stablecoins and bluechip collateral assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA). This avenue is designed to provide lenders with stable, real-yield returns by depositing assets that generate mtTokens—special ERC-20 tokens programmed to accrue interest automatically. For example, lending $5,000 worth of BTC at a 70% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could yield roughly 12% annual passive income through mtTokens. This approach is intended to preserve capital while rewarding holders with steady returns—something rare in today’s volatile market. On the flip side, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model will open borrowing opportunities using high-risk memecoin collateral such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE). These loans are expected to offer flexible repayment terms and slightly higher interest rates, aligning with the risk profile of the assets involved. The system’s smart contracts will automate risk management, aiming to ensure borrower flexibility while safeguarding lender interests. For instance, a borrower using PEPE as collateral might access a loan with a manageable interest rate over a short term—enabling liquidity without sacrificing upside exposure. The project is currently deep into Phase 5 of its presale, with tokens priced attractively at $0.03. The presale is nearing an 87% sellout, having already raised $12.8 million in funds. The approaching Phase 6 promises a price increase to $0.035, fueling urgent buying pressure among investors eager to secure tokens at a discount before the price escalates. This scarcity combined with rising demand creates a perfect storm of FOMO, making it an ideal moment for new participants to join. Roadmap to Mainstream Adoption and 3000% Upside Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap is meticulously structured to mitigate risk and build trust as the project progresses. Phase 1 laid the foundation with initial presale launches and audits by CertiK, which awarded impressive security scores—Token Scan 95 and Skynet 77.5—ensuring the platform’s smart contracts are reliable and secure. Phases 2 and 3 will focus on completing smart contract development, user interface design, and extensive internal and external audits. These phases also include developing advanced risk parameters and analytics tools to ensure robust risk management. The project will engage a bug bounty program to encourage community participation in identifying vulnerabilities, further solidifying the platform’s integrity. Phase 4 will mark the full platform launch, bringing live P2C and P2P lending markets online alongside cross-chain integrations. Institutional partnerships will also be pursued at this stage, expanding Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s reach into larger liquidity pools and professional investors. This carefully staged approach is designed to build confidence while scaling sustainably. Investors who joined early have already seen substantial returns. For instance, an $8,000 investment made during Phase 1 at $0.01 is now worth $24,000 at the current presale price of $0.03—reflecting a 200% gain or 3x growth. This illustrates how early presale participants are being handsomely rewarded even before the mainnet goes live. Meanwhile, seasoned crypto analysts—some of whom accurately predicted Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run—are now eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a top contender. Their forecasts suggest MUTM could reach between $0.50 and $1 by 2026, representing a 16x to 33x return from today’s price, or up to a 3200% increase for those who entered at the earliest stage. With the strategic tokenomics, dual lending model, and a clear roadmap toward cross-chain adoption and institutional integration, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only building to fill a critical gap in DeFi but is poised to redefine how lending works in this space.

2025-07-22 13:12:29+00:00,Fragbite becomes first Swedish gaming firm to launch BTC treasury,"Swedish gaming and e-sports firm Fragbite Group has become one of the first publicly listed companies in Sweden to adopt Bitcoin as a reserve asset. The company acquired 4.3 Bitcoin for $486,719 (SEK 6.63 million), at an average price of $112,958 per BTC, as part of a newly launched Bitcoin treasury strategy. The announcement marks a notable entry into the digital asset space by a European tech firm amid evolving regulatory clarity across the region. To fund the Bitcoin purchase, Fragbite raised SEK 6 million ($630,000) through an interest-free convertible loan. This loan structure gives the company a long-term, low-cost route to build digital reserves while limiting short-term financial risk. Fragbite Group @FragbiteGroup · Follow First purchase complete ✅4.3 bitcoin at an average price of app. USD 112 958 / bitcoin marks the start of operations under the newly established Bitcoin Treasury📢 fragbitegroup.com/en/press/fragb… $FRAG 12:33 PM · Jul 22, 2025 12 Reply Copy link Read 1 reply Convertible loan offers flexible BTC exposure The SEK 6 million loan is interest-free until November 30, 2030. Crucially, it includes a conversion clause that will trigger if Fragbite’s share price exceeds the conversion price of SEK 13 by 30% for 20 consecutive trading days. Should the share price reach 200% of the conversion price, the company also retains the right to forcibly convert the loan into equity. This mechanism provides a flexible treasury model—allowing Fragbite to scale its Bitcoin exposure based on share performance, rather than relying solely on internal cash reserves or dilutive funding rounds. It also gives investors a clear framework for understanding how digital asset exposure could evolve over time. Bitcoin integration reflects long-term diversification Fragbite’s entry into the Bitcoin market appears to be part of a broader strategy to diversify its treasury beyond traditional fiat-based reserves. The company’s board positioned the move as a long-term step, aligning with broader financial market shifts towards digital assets. The treasury strategy is structured in a way that allows Fragbite to scale its holdings if market conditions are favourable, without needing to raise additional capital or take on interest-bearing debt in the near term. By linking expansion to its equity performance, the company has created a direct feedback loop between shareholder value and its Bitcoin exposure. Fragbite joins early corporate adopters in Europe While global firms like MicroStrategy and Tesla have made headlines for their Bitcoin holdings, adoption in Europe has been slower and more cautious. Fragbite’s move represents one of the first major corporate treasury announcements from Sweden and places the company among a small but growing group of European firms adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The company has not disclosed any further targets for Bitcoin accumulation, but the structure of its convertible loan suggests that more purchases could follow if share price and market conditions align. By creating a dedicated funding mechanism early on, Fragbite has laid the groundwork for future allocations without needing to revisit financing arrangements. The 4.3 Bitcoin acquisition may be modest in size, but it reflects a larger shift in how even mid-cap public companies are starting to view digital assets—not merely as speculative instruments, but as viable long-term treasury assets.

According to Ali Martinez, by this rally the XRP price has successfully exited a bullish flag formation on the weekly chart, opening the door for a potentially explosive move for $15. While $15 may seem lofty, but the chart structure alongside significant market developments like Proshares Ultra XRP ETF approval backs this projections and makes it less speculative than it may appear. XRP Price Has Taken Support on Historical Highs Zooming into the daily chart, the XRP crypto recently bounced off a significant historical level, which is its previous all-time high zone of $3.40, now acting as support. This level was identified as crucial zone and the recent reaction at this level lends credibility to the thesis that XRP price is in the early stages of another bullish cycle. While the market awaits confirmation, the current consolidation above this historic support suggests bulls are gaining strength. Price discovery may resume if XRP crypto manages to push past the next key resistance at $3.66. Analyst Explains His Wave Theory and the Road Ahead Another critical angle comes from another analysts comparing XRP crypto’s current cycle to its 2017 performance. Back then, XRP price experienced three distinct growth waves. If the same structure repeats, the experts says we are presently in “Wave 1″. This wave has build around the previous ATH near the $3.40–$3.66 range. In the next “Wave 2,” as described by the analyst, would commence only if XRP price manages to clear the newly formed $3.66 threshold. This next phase is where the real expansion begins, moving the asset well into price discovery territory. If $XRP follows the same pattern as 2017, where it had 3 growth waves, then we are currently in ''''wave 1'''', entering ''''wave 2''''.

Despite ongoing debate, its stock trades at a significant premium over its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV), and analysts say it’s justified. TD Cowen Backs the Premium In a recent interview with The Block , analysts from global investment bank TD Cowen, Lance Vitanza and Jonnathan Navarrete, supported the view that Strategy’s premium is rational. They dismissed critics who argue that the stock should track its Bitcoin NAV directly, calling such views “logically flawed.” As of now: Market cap : $124.3 billion Bitcoin holdings : $72 billion NAV Premium : 72.6% Rather than being overvalued, TD Cowen believes Strategy’s ability to access low-cost capital sets it apart. Debunking the “Greater Fools” Theory Skeptics claim Strategy’s premium is driven by a speculative bubble—a belief that someone else will buy in at a higher price. However, TD Cowen analysts argue that Strategy’s financial engineering, particularly its “42/42” plan, creates intrinsic value. The 42/42 plan aims to raise $84 billion in equity and debt by 2027. With a blended borrowing rate of just 0.421%, Strategy can: Increase Bitcoin per share without dilution Create a Bitcoin “yield” effect that ETFs and retail investors cannot replicate Capital Flywheel Effect: A Unique Advantage Strategy’s flywheel approach fuels continuous Bitcoin accumulation. Recently: Raised $739.8 million via a $21 billion offering Bought 6,220 BTC at $118,940 per coin Added 3,077 BTC in profit—without issuing new shares Since January 1, Bitcoin per MSTR share is up 20.8% , doubling compared to 18 months ago. This efficiency amplifies returns beyond typical NAV-based models. The recent launch of “Stretch” (STRC) preferred stock further supports Strategy’s capital efficiency, offering more tools to expand its Bitcoin holdings without dilution. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Elon Musk’s SpaceX Just Moved $152 Million in Bitcoin, Are Whales Dumping? , Outlook: 900,000 BTC by 2027?

2025-07-22 13:34:25+00:00,Altcoin Trading Hits ATH: Here Are the Alts That Could Explode in This Rally,"With Binance recording a huge $100B in altcoin futures in just one day, another altcoin season might be nearby. Bitcoin dominates the mainstream narrative, but smart money quickly shifts into altcoins. Early investors are rapidly securing their positions before the market surge. Investors Are Betting Big on Altcoins In just 24 hours, the altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures has surged to $100.7B , the highest since Feb 3, 2025. The surge reveals a clear trend, as altcoins now account for 71% of Binance Futures volume, while Bitcoin holds at just 25%. Traders are shifting their focus to altcoins for the next significant move. After Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091.61 on July 14, 2025, altcoin activity has surged significantly across the market. For example, Ethereum has increased by 25% over the past seven days, while Bitcoin has only gone up 2%. The CMC Altcoin Season Index is at 48 , so there’s still time for investors who haven’t jumped on the trend yet. So, which altcoins are poised to benefit the most from the upcoming alt season? Here are three top picks, based on growing investor interest and strong fundamentals. And no, it’s not Ethereum, XRP, or Bonk. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bringing Speed and Scale to Bitcoin’s Slow Network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to enable fast and incredibly inexpensive transactions. When the full version launches, it is expected to support everything from dApps to meme coins and foster a utility ecosystem around Bitcoin. After validation, the corresponding $BTC is returned to the user’s Bitcoin address on Layer 1, ensuring high security. The best part is, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just an idea. It’s already being built, and the team recently announced the launch of the devnet. It can handle program deployment via Solana CLI, contract calls, transaction flows through the web console, and account state management. The performance remains stable, low latency, and contracts are already being ported over. $HYPER tokens, which fuel the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, are now available for purchase on the official website at fixed prices, with over $4 million raised so far. Early movers can secure annual percentage yields (APYs) over 200% through dynamic staking, right from the presale phase. It is designed to decline as more users join the pool, encouraging early participation. Get $HYPER from the official presale page. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT): Trading Firepower Built Straight into Telegram Snorter Token ($SNORT) is another popular altcoin sensation of this week. It operates a Telegram-native bot, best described as a smart trading suite built into chat. What exactly does that mean? Sub-second swaps, real-time copy trades, and token sniping—all without leaving the messaging app. $SNORT powers the platform and grants access to advanced tools and significant fee discounts. For context, the fees decrease from 1.5% to just 0.85% for those holding enough tokens, making it more affordable than major competitors. Snorter takes security seriously, boasting an 85% success rate in beta rugpull and honeypot detection. Blacklist scanners and mint trap alerts provide extra layers of protection. If the project delivers on its white paper vision, it could offer more depth and access than most existing DeFi platforms. But early investors looking for an upside don’t have time till then. The $SNORT presale is fast selling out with close to $2M raised, and staking yields are juicy at 183%. Get $SNORT now from the official presale page. 3. Solana ($SOL): Top Altcoin to Watch this Season Now trading for $199, Solana (SOL) has recorded a 25% jump in the last seven days alone and outperformed Bitcoin with flair. Technical indicators show $SOL bulls are in control, flashing strong buy signals across the board.

With Binance recording a huge $100B in altcoin futures in just one day, another altcoin season might be nearby. Bitcoin dominates the mainstream narrative, but smart money quickly shifts into altcoins. Early investors are rapidly securing their positions before the market surge. Investors Are Betting Big on Altcoins In just 24 hours, the altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures has surged to $100.7B , the highest since Feb 3, 2025. The surge reveals a clear trend, as altcoins now account for 71% of Binance Futures volume, while Bitcoin holds at just 25%. Traders are shifting their focus to altcoins for the next significant move. After Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091.61 on July 14, 2025, altcoin activity has surged significantly across the market. For example, Ethereum has increased by 25% over the past seven days, while Bitcoin has only gone up 2%. The CMC Altcoin Season Index is at 48 , so there’s still time for investors who haven’t jumped on the trend yet. So, which altcoins are poised to benefit the most from the upcoming alt season? Here are three top picks, based on growing investor interest and strong fundamentals. And no, it’s not Ethereum, XRP, or Bonk. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Bringing Speed and Scale to Bitcoin’s Slow Network Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to enable fast and incredibly inexpensive transactions. When the full version launches, it is expected to support everything from dApps to meme coins and foster a utility ecosystem around Bitcoin. After validation, the corresponding $BTC is returned to the user’s Bitcoin address on Layer 1, ensuring high security. The best part is, Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just an idea. It’s already being built, and the team recently announced the launch of the devnet. It can handle program deployment via Solana CLI, contract calls, transaction flows through the web console, and account state management. The performance remains stable, low latency, and contracts are already being ported over. $HYPER tokens, which fuel the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, are now available for purchase on the official website at fixed prices, with over $4 million raised so far. Early movers can secure annual percentage yields (APYs) over 200% through dynamic staking, right from the presale phase. It is designed to decline as more users join the pool, encouraging early participation. Get $HYPER from the official presale page. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT): Trading Firepower Built Straight into Telegram Snorter Token ($SNORT) is another popular altcoin sensation of this week. It operates a Telegram-native bot, best described as a smart trading suite built into chat. What exactly does that mean? Sub-second swaps, real-time copy trades, and token sniping—all without leaving the messaging app. $SNORT powers the platform and grants access to advanced tools and significant fee discounts. For context, the fees decrease from 1.5% to just 0.85% for those holding enough tokens, making it more affordable than major competitors. Snorter takes security seriously, boasting an 85% success rate in beta rugpull and honeypot detection. Blacklist scanners and mint trap alerts provide extra layers of protection. If the project delivers on its white paper vision, it could offer more depth and access than most existing DeFi platforms. But early investors looking for an upside don’t have time till then. The $SNORT presale is fast selling out with close to $2M raised, and staking yields are juicy at 183%. Get $SNORT now from the official presale page. 3. Solana ($SOL): Top Altcoin to Watch this Season Now trading for $199, Solana (SOL) has recorded a 25% jump in the last seven days alone and outperformed Bitcoin with flair. Technical indicators show $SOL bulls are in control, flashing strong buy signals across the board. The moving averages, one of the most apparent signs of market strength, indicate 13 out of 14 bullish signals. Does that mean Solana is ready to reclaim its ATH of $294.33? It’s too early to tell. But in the current climate, it’s not a long shot. And it won’t be just Solana that benefits from its growing momentum. Platforms that make use of Solana tech are also at an advantage. A good example is BONK, which has climbed over 20% on the weekly chart. Although still in the presale stages, Snorter Token and Bitcoin Hyper have also witnessed heavy traffic over the last few days.

According to SoSoValue, ARK Invest’s ARKB led the outflows, shedding $77.46 million, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC with $36.75 million and Fidelity’s FBTC with $12.75 million. Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL also recorded smaller outflows of $1.91 million and $2.48 million, respectively, while BlackRock’s IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF with $86.16 billion in assets under management, reported no inflows or outflows for the day. Profit-Taking After a Strong Rally Despite the pause, cumulative net inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs remain strong at $54.62 billion, with total net assets now standing at $151.60 billion, accounting for 6.52% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Many experts are suggesting that the withdrawals are part of a routine correction after a strong upward move, as institutions rebalance their positions to manage risk and secure profits following significant inflows earlier in July. On July 10 and 11, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion and $1.03 billion in daily inflows, marking the first time in history that two consecutive days brought in over a billion dollars each into Bitcoin funds. Ether ETFs Continue Strong Inflow Streak While Bitcoin-base investment funds saw a brief pause, spot Ether ETFs extended their inflow streak to 12 consecutive days , recording $296.59 million in net inflows on Monday. This pushed the cumulative net inflow for Ether ETFs to $7.78 billion, highlighting rising institutional interest in Ethereum-based products. Last Wednesday marked a record day for Ether ETFs, which saw $726.74 million in daily inflows, the highest since their launch, followed by $602.02 million on Thursday. The consistent demand for Ether ETFs reflects increasing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term utility as the network continues to attract activity around tokenization and decentralized applications, positioning Ether products to capture growing institutional allocations alongside Bitcoin funds in the expanding crypto investment landscape.

2025-07-22 13:40:18+00:00,Bitcoin Market: Navigating the Crucial Consolidation Phase Towards $115K,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Market: Navigating the Crucial Consolidation Phase Towards $115K The cryptocurrency world has been on a rollercoaster ride, with Bitcoin leading the charge to exhilarating new all-time highs. Yet, as the dust settles, the Bitcoin market finds itself in a period of consolidation. This isn’t a sign of weakness, but rather a healthy recalibration after an intense rally. Understanding this phase is crucial for any investor looking to navigate the volatile yet promising landscape of digital assets. What exactly does this consolidation mean for Bitcoin’s future, and could a retest of the significant $115,000 level truly be on the horizon? Decoding the Bitcoin Market ‘s Current State: The Glassnode Perspective To truly grasp the dynamics at play in the current Bitcoin market , we turn to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, renowned for its deep insights into blockchain data. Their latest findings paint a clear picture of shifting momentum following Bitcoin’s monumental surge. One of the key metrics highlighted by Glassnode is the Realized Profit to Loss Ratio (RPLR). This indicator measures the ratio of realized profits to realized losses on the network, offering a window into the profitability of coins spent by investors. Historically, an RPLR above 1 indicates that more profits are being taken than losses, a common occurrence during bull markets. The Shift from 3.9 to 2.6: Glassnode reported a significant drop in the RPLR from a peak of 3.9 to 2.6. What does this mean? A higher RPLR (like 3.9) suggests aggressive profit-taking, often seen near market tops as investors capitalize on gains. The subsequent decline to 2.6 indicates a cooling off in this intense profit-taking behavior. While still above 1 (meaning profits are still being realized), the reduced ratio signals that the frenetic pace of selling for profit has subsided. Signaling Cooling Profitability: This drop doesn’t necessarily mean losses are accumulating, but rather that the rate at which profits are being locked in has slowed. It suggests that fewer participants are selling their holdings at substantial gains, or that the gains themselves are becoming less extreme. This often precedes or accompanies a period of market consolidation. Investors Adjusting to Range-Bound Conditions: Glassnode explicitly stated that investors are now adjusting to ‘range-bound conditions.’ This implies that the market is no longer in a strong directional trend (up or down) but is instead trading within a defined price range. In such an environment, the focus shifts from chasing parabolic gains to identifying support and resistance levels, and potentially accumulating at lower prices within the range. This data from Glassnode provides a fundamental understanding of investor sentiment and behavior, suggesting a move from aggressive profit-taking to a more strategic, patient approach within the Bitcoin market . Understanding Range-Bound Conditions in the Bitcoin Market : What Does it Mean for You? When analysts talk about the Bitcoin market being ‘range-bound,’ it’s a critical concept for investors to grasp. Unlike the exhilarating surges of a bull run or the sharp declines of a bear market, a range-bound market is characterized by prices trading consistently between a specific high (resistance) and a specific low (support) for an extended period. Think of it like a ping-pong ball bouncing between two walls. The price might fluctuate significantly within that range, but it doesn’t break out decisively in either direction. For investors, this phase presents both unique challenges and opportunities: Challenges: Frustration for Momentum Traders: Those who thrive on rapid price appreciation may find range-bound conditions frustrating, as large, quick gains become less frequent. Increased Volatility within the Range: While the overall trend is flat, intra-range volatility can still be high, leading to potential ‘shake-outs’ where weak hands are forced to sell. Uncertainty: The lack of a clear directional trend can lead to indecision and analysis paralysis among investors. Opportunities: Accumulation Phases: Smart investors often view consolidation as an ideal time to ‘dollar-cost average’ (DCA) into their positions, buying at various points within the range to lower their average entry price. Strategic Trading: Experienced traders can profit by buying near the support level and selling near the resistance level, though this requires precise execution and risk management. Healthy Market Reset: Consolidation allows the market to digest recent gains, shake out speculative froth, and build a stronger foundation for the next upward move. It prevents markets from becoming overheated and unsustainable. Recognizing and adapting to range-bound conditions is vital for long-term success in the Bitcoin market . It calls for patience, a strategic mindset, and a focus on long-term value rather than short-term fluctuations.

This has left the digital assets market hanging in the middle of the bull run.

Many experts say national stablecoins like this could soon reshape how people send money and pay bills. Growing Public Interest in Cryptocurrencies The popularity of cryptocurrencies in South Korea is growing fast. Currently, over 25% of South Koreans aged 20 to 50 own crypto assets, and about 70% of them plan to increase their investments. Many see digital currencies as an important part of their future savings and retirement plans, showing the increasing role crypto plays in everyday financial lives."
2025-07-22 14:00:00+00:00,Maestro’s indexer for Ordinals & Runes enables new Bitcoin DeFi applications on ICP,"Maestro is looking to bring Bitcoin-based assets such as Ordinals and Runes into the nascent BTCFi ecosystem with the upcoming launch of a new “metaprotocol indexer” for applications built on the Internet Computer Protocol . It promises to be a key piece of infrastructure for Bitcoin DeFi developers that will change the way Ordinals and Runes can be used by financial applications, simplifying how they’re used as collateral for decentralized loans, for example. What the Indexer does is enable trustless validation of Runes and Ordinals, which means they can be verified without using vulnerable cross-chain bridges or third-party custodians. In turn, that provides increased security for every DeFi user. Ordinals and Runes are a game-changing development in the Bitcoin ecosystem. These new protocols support the creation of non-fungible tokens and memecoins that live on the original Bitcoin blockchain, increasing its utility. They have played a major role in helping to grow the Bitcoin ecosystem, transforming it from a store of value into a rich, digital asset platform that can provide a foundation for decentralized finance. However, using Ordinals and Runes in Bitcoin-based DeFi has remained challenging, especially in the context of cross-chain applications, for there’s no easy way to bridge them from Bitcoin’s blockchain to other decentralized networks. This is the challenge Maestro is attempting to solve, and to do so, it has just been awarded a sizable grant by the DFINITY Foundation, which is one of the major financial backers of the Internet Computer Protocol. ICP, as it’s called, is the creator of a popular Bitcoin integration that brings smart contract-like functionality to BTC assets, and is used by developers to build sophisticated DeFi applications with similar functionalities to those found on Ethereum, Solana, and other smart contract chains. Maestro explained that its indexer makes it simple for DeFi applications to validate any Ordinal- or Rune-based asset, so they can be used by cross-chain applications such as Liquidium , Odin.Fun and Omnity, without running the risks associated with blockchain bridges and custodians. Indeed, Liquidium was keen to proclaim that it’s the first ICP-based application to make use of the Maestro’s Indexer. It wants users to be able to lock up Ordinals and Runes assets on the Bitcoin blockchain, so they can be deposited as collateral to lend Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies such as USDC. By using the Indexer to validate those assets natively within ICP Canisters (smart contracts), Liquidium will be able to process its decentralized loans much faster, and with fewer security risks, it said. Maestro co-founder and chief executive officer Marvin Bertin said the integration will help to solidify ICP’s lead within the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem and give developers the ability to develop new categories of cross-chain applications that can leverage BTC-based liquidity. He added that the company intends to make the Indexer open-source, ensuring full transparency and giving developers the opportunity to adapt it to their needs. DFINITY Foundation’s Lomesh Dutta believes the development has the potential to unlock a “massive wave of innovation” from developers using ICP’s Chain Fusion technology. “Maestro’s native Indexer adds a valuable piece of infrastructure for the growing Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem on the Internet Computer,” he added.

2025-07-22 14:00:19+00:00,Bitcoin DeFi Empowered By Maestro And ICP Partnership,"Maestro, the tailor-made enterprise-grade infrastructure provider for Bitcoin , joins ICP, the fully decentralized web3 cloud platform, to augment some of BTC’s protocols. The rapidly maturing BTCFi movement has grown from speculative to institutional-grade, multi-chain DeFi infrastructure. Bitcoin-Native Ordinals And Runes Advance According to a press release shared with CryptoPotato, Maestro has been awarded a grant from the DFINITY Foundation to develop an enterprise-grade BTC metaprotocol indexer for the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). The collab brings a high-throughput ICP canister, which will provide real-time Ordinals and Runes data within Bitcoin’s integration. Ordinals is a method of inscribing data onto individual satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin . Runes, on the other hand, are a type of fungible token deployed on the leading asset’s network. Since its release in 2023, the integration of ICP and BTC has become a benchmark smart contract platform, leveraging Chain Fusion technology. By powering some prominent BTCFi applications such as Liquidium, Omnity, and Odin.fun, Maestro’s inclusion will further bolster these capabilities by strengthening infrastructure for Ordinals and Runes-based apps. Liquidium, the largest lending protocol built on the largest blockchain network, will first utilize the new indexer. Maestro will power the protocol’s upcoming instant cross-chain loans product, which will enable users to lock BTC on the Bitcoin Layer 1 and simultaneously borrow USDT on Ethereum without requiring bridges or token wrapping. The Maestro Indexer offers validation of assets native to Bitcoin, directly within ICP canisters. The system is designed to be reliable, featuring mempool awareness for quick responses and defense against blockchain reorganizations, ensuring the performance and secure data delivery. Big Development for Maestro Maestro’s infrastructure is already being utilized by over 1,000 developers and embedded in more than 200 applications, and will now extend to the ICP ecosystem. The indexer will be open-source, allowing software developers to tap into a powerful tool for creating BTC-native apps ranging from DeFi to gaming. “Maestro’s native indexer adds a valuable piece of infrastructure for the growing Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem on the Internet Computer,” noted Lomesh Dutta, VP of Growth at the DFINITY Foundation. “Now we’re able to provide developers with direct, trustless access to Ordinals and Runes data to enable further the massive wave of innovation that relies on Chain Fusion’s unique ability to interact with Bitcoin without bridges or intermediaries.” The CEO and Co-Founder of Maestro, Marvin Bertin, celebrated the partnership: “I’m thrilled to collaborate with the DFINITY Foundation to extend ICP’s Bitcoin integration with secure Runes and Ordinals indexing necessary for financial apps like Liquidium and Odin.fun. This partnership further strengthens ICP’s lead in the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem and unlocks new functionality for users.” BTCFi is an emerging field with many approaches, designed to enhance the asset’s smart contract capabilities. As these contracts were not the original intention, such integrations as this alliance can potentially catalyze further adoption and use cases. The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols on Bitcoin has experienced significant growth, surging from just over $300 million at the start of last year to a whopping $7 billion at the time of printing, according to data from DefiLlama.

2025-07-22 14:00:25+00:00,U.S. Stock Markets Ignite: Unpacking Today’s Positive Open,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Markets Ignite: Unpacking Today’s Positive Open For many seasoned investors and curious newcomers alike, the opening bell of the U.S. stock markets often sets the tone for the entire financial day. Today, that tone was decidedly optimistic, with major indices showing early gains. While our primary focus at BitcoinWorld often revolves around the dynamic world of digital assets, understanding the pulse of traditional markets, particularly the U.S. stock markets , is crucial. Their movements frequently ripple across the broader financial landscape, impacting everything from investor sentiment to capital flows, which can indirectly influence the cryptocurrency market. U.S. Stock Markets Ignite: A Promising Start to the Trading Day The trading day commenced with a palpable sense of optimism across the board for U.S. stock markets . Investors watched as the major indices registered positive movements right from the outset, signaling a potentially strong session ahead. This initial uplift often reflects pre-market sentiment, driven by overnight news, corporate announcements, or economic data releases. Index Opening Performance S&P500 +0.09% NASDAQ +0.03% Dow +0.07% These early gains, though seemingly modest, represent a collective vote of confidence from market participants. The S&P500, a benchmark for large-cap U.S. equities, saw a fractional rise, indicating broad market strength. The tech-heavy NASDAQ also edged higher, suggesting continued interest in growth stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 significant U.S. companies, contributed to the positive momentum. Such an opening for the U.S. stock markets can set a bullish tone, encouraging further buying throughout the day and potentially attracting more capital into the market. Why Are U.S. Stock Markets Seeing This Positive Momentum? Understanding the forces behind market movements is key to interpreting their implications. Today’s positive opening in the U.S. stock markets likely stems from a confluence of factors, each contributing to an environment of cautious optimism. Favorable Economic Data: Recent economic indicators, such as unemployment figures, manufacturing output, or consumer confidence surveys, might have exceeded expectations, suggesting a resilient economy. Positive economic news often fuels investor confidence, leading to increased buying activity. Strong Corporate Earnings: If companies have been reporting stronger-than-expected earnings, it provides a fundamental basis for stock appreciation. Robust corporate performance signals healthy business operations and future growth potential, making their stocks more attractive. Easing Inflationary Pressures: Any signs that inflation is cooling or that central banks might adopt a less aggressive stance on interest rate hikes can significantly boost market sentiment. Lower inflation typically means higher corporate profits and more disposable income for consumers. Positive Investor Sentiment: Sometimes, market movements are driven by collective psychology. A general sense of optimism, perhaps fueled by geopolitical stability or positive news cycles, can create a self-fulfilling prophecy of rising prices. When sentiment is positive, investors are more willing to take on risk. Technical Factors: Beyond fundamentals, technical analysis often plays a role. Breaking through key resistance levels or forming bullish chart patterns can trigger algorithmic trading and attract more buyers, further propelling the U.S. stock markets upwards. The Interplay: How U.S. Stock Markets Influence Crypto For our readers deeply entrenched in the digital asset space, the immediate question often is: ‘How does this affect Bitcoin and altcoins?’ The relationship between traditional finance, particularly the U.S. stock markets , and the cryptocurrency market is complex and constantly evolving. Historically, especially during periods of high volatility or uncertainty, Bitcoin has often correlated with tech stocks, particularly the NASDAQ. Here’s why this connection is relevant: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When traditional markets like the U.S. stock markets show strength and investor confidence is high (a ‘risk-on’ environment), investors are generally more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a downturn in stocks can lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, where investors pull back from riskier assets, potentially impacting crypto prices. Liquidity Flow: A buoyant stock market can free up capital for investors who might then diversify into other asset classes, including crypto. Conversely, if investors need to cover losses or meet margin calls in traditional markets, they might liquidate crypto holdings. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional investors enter the crypto space, their investment decisions are often influenced by their broader portfolio performance and risk management strategies, which are heavily tied to tr",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-stock-markets-open-4/,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|FIAT,Crypto News|economic indicators|financial news|investing|Market Analysis|U.S. Stock Markets,BTC,"U.S. Stock Markets Ignite: Unpacking Today’s Positive Open.

The Toronto-based company said the buyback plan, beginning July 28, will let it acquire up to nearly 50 million shares on the open market through the Nasdaq and Toronto Stock Exchange over the next 12 months, with purchases subject to regulatory limits and daily volume caps. All repurchased shares will be cancelled. BITF shares rallied as much as 18% on the news before paring some the gains. Recently, it was up 8% even as most of the rest of the bitcoin mining center lost ground with bitcoin again declining below $118,000. ""We believe that Bitfarms’ shares are currently undervalued because our Bitcoin business is underappreciated by the market, with little to no value being associated with our HPC potential,"" said CEO Ben Gagnon said.

In the past week, BTC dominance fell by 2.98 percentage points, one of its steepest weekly declines for the year to date.

Since then, the metric fell to 59.2%, while the dominance of ETH and blue chip altcoins expanded slightly. There are expectations of a slide to 51% dominance in coming weeks. For some analysts, a true altcoin season may start after BTC dominance dips to 55%. The recent drop in dominance does not preclude other price rallies for BTC. This time around, BTC is not the sole focus, as other assets are added to ETF purchases and corporate treasuries. Altcoins and meme tokens also remain more accessible to retail traders. The BTC dominance is still flat in the long term, but is showing signals for a trend reversal in the past few days. The growing altcoin season signals also came from peak performance for Solana (SOL), which once again crossed the $200 mark.

2025-07-22 14:11:32+00:00,Bitcoin ETFs Post First Daily Outflows in Nearly Two Weeks Amid Profit-Taking,"After a strong 12-day streak of inflows, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded net outflows totaling $131.35 million on Monday. The retreat follows a wave of enthusiasm that had seen $6.6 billion enter the market over nearly two weeks, reflecting renewed institutional and retail appetite for the asset class. This reversal is being interpreted by market analysts as a sign of measured profit-taking rather than fear-driven selling. ARK Invest Sees Largest Outflows Among ETF Issuers The bulk of Monday’s outflows came from ARK Invest’s ARKB fund, which registered a $77.46 million pullback. Grayscale’s GBTC was next in line, recording $36.75 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC also saw notable exits, shedding $12.75 million. Smaller outflows came from VanEck’s HODL and Bitwise’s BITB, with $2.48 million and $1.91 million, respectively. Interestingly, BlackRock’s IBIT, which holds the largest net assets at $86.16 billion, remained neutral, showing no inflows or outflows for the day. Despite the single-day downturn, the cumulative net inflow figure for all spot Bitcoin ETFs remains healthy at $54.62 billion. Total net assets across the group now stand at $151.6 billion, which represents 6.52% of Bitcoin’s overall market capitalization. Market Rebalance Seen as Key Driver Behind ETF Exits Kronos Research’s chief investment officer, Vincent Liu, explained that the timing of the outflows lines up with strategic rebalancing. “The recent ETF outflows reflect profit-taking near the highs and measured institutional rebalancing to lock in gains,” Liu told Cointelegraph. According to Liu, this shift is not indicative of panic selling, but rather a natural market cycle after a significant rally. “It’s not panic but positioning — a natural pause after a strong upward run,” he added. This cooling-off period comes after two consecutive billion-dollar inflow days earlier in July — $1.18 billion on July 10 and $1.03 billion on July 11 — marking the first time such an event has occurred in Bitcoin ETF history. Ethereum ETFs Continue to Attract Capital While Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows, Ether-based ETFs continued their positive momentum. Spot Ether ETFs saw an impressive $296.59 million in net inflows on Monday, pushing their total inflows to $7.78 billion. Ethereum products are now enjoying a 12-day streak of inflows, mirroring the earlier run seen in Bitcoin ETFs. That streak includes a standout performance on Wednesday when Ethereum ETFs pulled in $726.74 million — their highest single-day inflow since launch. This was followed by Thursday’s $602.02 million inflow, showing a steady increase in demand for Ether-related investment vehicles. Conclusion While Monday’s outflows from Bitcoin ETFs may seem like a setback, analysts see them as a healthy breather rather than a sign of a broader shift in sentiment.

At this point, the latest news came from Western Union. Accordingly, global money transfer giant Western Union is reportedly looking for ways to integrate stablecoins into its digital wallet infrastructure, as stablecoins are increasingly accepted in the mainstream following the passage of the GENIUS Act.

The $2.14 million acquisition brought Genius Group’s total Bitcoin reserve to $2.35 million in value at the time of writing, with an unrealized gain of $216,000. Genius Group Makes Fourth Bitcoin Purchase in July It’s the company’s fourth purchase this month, following acquisitions of 20 BTC on July 2, 28 BTC on July 8, and 32 BTC on July 13, according to BitcoinTreasuries.NET. Genius Group aims to scale its holdings to 1,000 BTC by the end of 2025, eventually hitting 10,000 BTC over two years. The initiative is supported by U.S. legislative developments, particularly the Government Evaluation of New Innovations in the United States (GENIUS) Act, which the firm says will enable the expansion of its blockchain-based learning ecosystem. Part of that ecosystem is Genius Academy, a blockchain-powered platform where students earn Genius Education Merits (GEMs), tokens equivalent to one satoshi. Though not currently convertible to fiat or crypto, GEMs function like airline points and may become part of a stablecoin system pending regulatory approvals. The company is pursuing a Permitted Payment Stablecoin Issuer (PPSI) license and a separate Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license.

It also plans to develop on-chain course certifications recognized as regulated digital assets, granting educators blockchain-based IP rights. Genius Group’s broader vision includes real-world integration: retreats and accelerators where participants can pay using GEMs or the future stablecoin for services like lodging and meals. Ethereum Poised to Gain Most From GENIUS Act Meanwhile, Ethereum stands to benefit most from the GENIUS Act, according to Ether Machine CEO Andrew Keys, who noted that “90% of tokenized assets and stablecoins are deployed on Ethereum.” He likened Ethereum’s dominance in tokenization to Google’s in internet search, citing its infrastructure’s role in making the stablecoin ecosystem possible. Public companies are increasingly adding altcoins like Ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL, and XRP to their treasury strategies, according to a report from Animoca Brands Research. Michael Saylor’s Strategy popularized this model by holding over 600,000 Bitcoins as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation. Just recently, BIT Mining announced plans to raise between $200 million and $300 million to build a Solana (SOL) treasury as part of a broader expansion into the fast-growing blockchain ecosystem. Last week, DeFi Development Corp. revealed that it has acquired $2.7 million worth of Solana as part of its aggressive crypto treasury strategy.

2025-07-22 14:25:18+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Plunge: What the Shocking Drop Below $118,000 Means for Investors","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge: What the Shocking Drop Below $118,000 Means for Investors The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic landscape, often characterized by rapid shifts and unexpected movements. Recently, market monitoring by Bitcoin World has indicated a significant event: the Bitcoin price has fallen below the crucial $118,000 mark. Specifically, BTC is now trading at $117,992.1 on the Binance USDT market. This latest downturn has certainly captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, prompting questions about the underlying causes and potential future implications for the broader digital asset ecosystem. Understanding these market dynamics is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Decline? When the Bitcoin price experiences a sharp decline, it’s rarely due to a single factor. Instead, it’s often a confluence of various macroeconomic, geopolitical, and internal market forces. While the immediate trigger for this specific drop below $118,000 might be complex, we can explore common elements that frequently contribute to such market movements: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, rising interest rates, persistent inflation, or concerns about a potential recession can lead investors to de-risk, pulling capital from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Scrutiny: News of increased regulatory pressure, potential bans, or unfavorable policy changes in major economies can spook investors and trigger sell-offs. Uncertainty around new legislation can create a ‘wait-and-see’ approach. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly impact the market. A substantial sell-off by a few large entities can create cascading effects, driving the Bitcoin price down rapidly. Technical Breakdown: From a technical analysis perspective, breaking key support levels (like $118,000 in this instance) can trigger automated sell orders and further bearish sentiment, pushing the price lower. Liquidation Cascades: In highly leveraged markets, a minor price drop can trigger liquidations of leveraged positions, leading to forced selling and accelerating the downward momentum. Negative News or FUD: Any negative news, even if unconfirmed or exaggerated (often termed ‘Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt’ or FUD), can quickly spread through social media and investor forums, influencing sentiment and leading to panic selling. It’s important to remember that the crypto market operates 24/7, and information travels at lightning speed, making it highly susceptible to these influences. Understanding the Implications of a Sub-$118,000 Bitcoin Price A drop in the Bitcoin price , especially below a psychological or technical support level, has several immediate and potential long-term implications for the market and its participants: Investor Sentiment: A sharp decline can erode investor confidence, leading to fear and potentially more selling. New investors might become hesitant, while existing ones might reconsider their positions. Altcoin Performance: Bitcoin often acts as the market’s bellwether. When BTC falls, altcoins typically follow suit, often with greater volatility. This can lead to a broader market downturn. Liquidation Risks: For traders using leverage, a significant price drop can lead to margin calls and forced liquidations, exacerbating market instability. Mining Profitability: A lower Bitcoin price directly impacts the profitability of Bitcoin mining, potentially leading some less efficient miners to cease operations, which can in turn affect network hash rate. Opportunity for Accumulation: Conversely, experienced investors often view significant price drops as ‘buy the dip’ opportunities, allowing them to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower cost, particularly those with a long-term investment horizon. This fluctuation underscores the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, reminding participants of the need for robust risk management strategies. Navigating Volatility: Strategies for Bitcoin Price Fluctuations In a market as dynamic as cryptocurrency, understanding how to react to significant movements in the Bitcoin price is paramount. Here are some actionable insights and strategies that investors often employ: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Before making any decisions, thoroughly research the market, specific assets, and the factors influencing their prices. Rely on credible sources and avoid impulsive reactions based on social media hype or fear. 2. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals (e.g., weekly or monthly), regardless of the Bitcoin price . This strategy helps mitigate the risk of buying at a market peak and averages out your purchase price over time. 3.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells his 2.8 million followers that many assets may be currently overvalued due to speculation and investor optimism. However, he says that a bubble bursting correction may present a golden opportunity for the flagship crypto asset and the two precious metals. “Bubbles are about to start busting. When bubbles bust, odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too. Good news. If prices of gold, silver and Bitcoin crash, I will be buying. Take care.” Earlier this month, Kiyosaki announced that after Bitcoin’s explosive move past $120,000, he was stopping his purchases of BTC for the time being. He said he wouldn’t start buying Bitcoin again until a clearer financial picture came into view. “Yay: Bitcoin over $120,000. Great news for those who already have some Bitcoin. Bad news for those who, for whatever reason, never ‘pulled the trigger.’ They own nothing. As warned in previous X, ‘Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.’ I am buying one more coin and get fatter. I will not buy any more – until I know where the economy is going. As tempting as Bitcoin going to $200,000 to $1 million is, I don’t want to be a hog and get slaughtered.

2025-07-22 14:44:41+00:00,Top 3 Meme Coins Gemini Thinks Could Skyrocket This Year,"After a four-month slump earlier this year, meme coins are well and truly back, fueled by Bitcoin and Ethereum breaking past new all-time highs. The renewed confidence in the broader market has reignited interest in high-risk, high-reward tokens, with meme coins once again leading the charge. The total meme coin market cap has surged by over 75% in just the past 30 days , proving that hype-driven assets still have serious upside potential when the market sentiment turns bullish. With social media fueling their growth, meme coins continue to offer some of the fastest (and wildest) gains in crypto. But with hundreds of new tokens launching every week, how do you separate the true breakout stars from the rest? To help you discover the best meme coins with real explode-worthy potential, we turned to Gemini to see which three tokens it believes could explode in 2025. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Best Meme Coin to Buy Now, Building a New Bitcoin L2 for Web3 Compatibility Bitcoin is by far the most popular cryptocurrency in the world right now. However, that dominance doesn’t quite carry over to its blockchain, which continues to struggle with network congestion and slow transaction speeds. Moreover, Bitcoin’s architecture doesn’t support decentralized or Web3 applications. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps in. It’s the first Bitcoin Layer 2 solution designed for faster transactions and enhanced programmability. $HYPER converts native Bitcoin into wrapped Bitcoin via a decentralized, non-custodial canonical bridge. This wrapped Bitcoin can then be used seamlessly across DeFi platforms, dApps, and NFT marketplaces. This leap in functionality is powered by Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, allowing Bitcoin Hyper to execute smart contracts with ultra-low latency and lightning-fast speeds. Buying $HYPER comes with multiple benefits, including reduced gas fees, generous staking rewards (currently yielding 229%), and governance rights within the ecosystem. The project is currently in presale and has already raised a massive $4.1M. Each $HYPER token is currently priced at just $0.01235, one of its lowest-ever entry points. According to our $HYPER price prediction , the token could surge by as much as 2,500% and hit $0.32 by the end of the year. 2. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Easy-to-Use & Super-Secure Telegram-Based Trading Bot Snorter Bot, powered by Snorter Token ($SNORT) , is a Telegram-native trading tool built specifically for retail traders, offering a one-stop solution to bypass the dominance of crypto whales and trade the hottest new meme coins with ease. Simply place your buy/sell limit and stop orders directly within the Telegram chat. As soon as liquidity is added to those tokens, Snorter automatically executes your orders, giving you the edge to compete with institutional players using advanced trading tools. In addition to simplifying trading, Snorter also prioritizes your security. For instance, it vets each meme coin before allowing trading in it so that you do not fall prey to honeypots or rug pulls. The bot will also come equipped to protect you from advanced scams like sandwich attacks. Buying the $SNORT token unlocks further benefits. Most notably, your trading fee is slashed from 1.5% to just 0.85%, the lowest rate in the industry. Snorter Token is currently in presale and has raised $2.2M at the time of writing. Each token is available for just $0.0989, and as per our Snorter Token price prediction , it can hit $0.94 by the end of 2025, giving you a massive 850% return. 3. Aura ($AURA) – Viral Meme Coin Eyeing a Massive Fresh Rally Aura has become one of the standout buzzwords of 2025, dominating not just meme culture but also trending across social media and online communities. While $AURA may not come with any real-world utility, its 108% surge over the past month is a clear reminder that some of the biggest gains in crypto often come from hype-fueled tokens. What makes it even more fun? Token holders can ‘measure’ their own aura by using the project’s unique meme generator to craft personalized +Aura memes, boosting engagement and virality. The $AURA token is currently trading at $0.2276, and with meme coin mania still in its early stages, this could be a prime entry point before the next leg up. Conclusion With the meme coin market heating up fast, we sought Gemini’s insights to cut through the noise. Its top picks offer a mix of viral momentum, strong community backing, and explosive upside potential. If you’re hunting for the best altcoins to watch in 2025 , tokens like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) and Snorter Token ($SNORT) should definitely be on your radar.
