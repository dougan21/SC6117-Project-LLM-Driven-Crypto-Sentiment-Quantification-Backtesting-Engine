In a new podcast, Goldman Sachs chief economist and head of global investment research Jan Hatzius calls the US dollar the “dog that didn’t bark.” Hatzius says the US economy has stabilized since April, when the stock market plunged amid Trump’s trade war. However, he points out that the dollar has continued to weaken, depreciating even as the economy rebounds. The economist says the dollar’s bearish price action suggests it’s being driven by long-term structural factors rather than the near-term economic outlook. “The dollar is still very highly valued on a broad trade-weighted basis, and that historically sets up for depreciation in the coming years. The US still runs a very large current account deficit that needs to be financed by equal-sized capital inflows. Then there are some of these more tail risk concerns around things like Fed independence that probably also have an impact on how foreign investors perceive investments in the US… This is not about a fire sale. It’s about making it a little bit more difficult to obtain the capital inflows that are needed to cover the current account deficit.” In April of this year, Hatzius said that the US had a current account deficit of $1.1 trillion, which needed to be financed by foreign investments in US assets such as Treasuries and equities. The current account deficit exists because the US spends more than it earns from the global economy. By consuming more than it produces, the country relies on foreign investment to bridge the gap. But when foreign funding slows, pressure builds on the dollar as capital flows outward, increasing the global supply of USD and contributing to its devaluation. At time of writing, the US dollar index (DXY), which tracks the performance of the dollar against a basket of major currencies, is down about 10% year-to-date.

The company stated that BTC has entered a classic “bull flag” formation, a positive technical structure often seen following rapid price increases. According to MakroVision''s analysis, the most critical short-term resistance level for Bitcoin is the Fibonacci retracement at around $121,100. Breaking this level could trigger a new upward wave. Meanwhile, support at around $113,600 coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, and a potential return to this level would be considered a healthy technical correction.

2025-07-26 21:35:47+00:00,US Feds File Suit to Forfeit $7.1M in Crypto With Ties to Oil and Gas Storage Fraud,"The U.S. Department of Justice is cracking down on yet another cryptocurrency fraud ploy. The losses amount to tens of millions, and it’s expected that more will be identified. An Elaborate Scheme The U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Washington filed a civil action on Tuesday, demanding the forfeiture of cryptocurrency assets valued at roughly $7.1 million. The funds were seized during an investigation into a scheme involving fraudulent investment in oil and gas, which Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller announced. The assets are only a fraction of the $97 million obtained by coconspirators between June 2022 and July 2024, which Homeland Security Investigations seized in December last year. “The co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,” said Attorney Miller. “Federal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.” According to the filing and other case records, the plot was presented as escrow accounts for purchasing oil tank storage in either Rotterdam, the Netherlands, or Houston, which spanned from at least August 2022 through August 2024. The victims were convinced to send money to these accounts, where the conspirators indicated that investors could make significant profits by renting out the oil tank storage to others. At least seven separate entities have been marked where funds were sent. However, the good news ended there, as once the funds were sent, no further information on the investment was provided, and the co-schemers just stopped replying. How The Funds Were Moved A resident from Newcastle, Washington, Geoffrey K. Auyeung, 47, was indicted as a coconspirator in the U.S in August 2024, being charged with receiving the majority of the funds generated by the deceptive plan. The money was quickly shuffled to one or more of at least 81 accounts at various institutions, either offshore or not, or to one of the at least 19 different crypto accounts. The assets were then funneled into various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, USDT, USDC, and Ethereum, the majority of which was further transferred to accounts at the Binance exchange. The forfeiture filing further states that the crypto accounts, which were seized, were linked to individuals in Russia and Nigeria, where some of the victims’ funds, used to purchase digital assets, were also sent to exchanges in those countries. At least one of the money markets in Russia or Nigeria is alleged to have facilitated money laundering for transnational criminal organizations, including terrorist organizations and other parties that have been known to violate international trade sanctions. At the time of Auyeung’s arrest, $2.3 million was seized from his bank accounts, which is in addition to the $7.1 million in crypto the government is seeking to forfeit. If the court approves the forfeiture, the funds will be distributed accordingly to the victims. Investigators, so far, have identified dozens of such cases, with the total amount of exploits reaching approximately $17.9 million, which is expected to grow as more casualties are identified.

2025-07-26 22:00:00+00:00,Crypto Still Seen as ''Risky'' Among U.S. Investors Despite Ownership Surging 8x Since 2018: Survey,"Cryptocurrency may be easier to buy than ever, but most Americans still want no part of it. A new Gallup survey found that just 14% of U.S. adults own crypto, a figure that has been growing but still represents a small slice of the investing public. The study, conducted in mid-June, revealed deep skepticism about cryptocurrencies. 60% of respondents said they have no interest in ever buying cryptocurrency, and just 17% admitted they’re intrigued. Only 4% of respondents said they plan on buying crypto in the near future. Gallup also found that among U.S. investors owning more than $10,000 in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, 55% considered the asset class “very risky.” Still, ownership rates skyrocketed from 2% in 2018 to 17%. This skepticism isn''t surprising, despite the U.S. having a pro-crypto president and clearer regulations that have recently been rolling in. While the 2021 bull run ushered in extreme volatility and made crypto a mainstream topic, the subsequent brutal crypto winter, which saw many high-profile bankruptcies, such as FTX, as well as scams and exploits, soured retail investors'' sentiment. Although crypto has since then seen institutional investors jumping into the market, helping it become more legitimate, many retail investors, burned by the past losses, are likely still staying vigilant. Four years ago, Gallup found that 6% of U.S. investors owned cryptocurrency. That figure has since risen but may be conservative, as a Fed survey revealed 12% ownership among U.S. investors. Diving deeper into the ownership, the demographic divide is stark. While one in four men aged 18 to 49 owns crypto, the survey found that ownership drops sharply among women and older adults. College graduates and high-income earners report above-average participation, but seniors and low-income households remain largely absent from the space, the survey shows. Knowledge gaps also persist. Nearly everyone surveyed had heard of crypto, but only 35% said they actually understood how it works. Familiarity was highest among younger men and the wealthier. Even among those who claim to understand crypto, most still call it a risky bet. Among U.S. investors, 64% see the asset class as “very risky,” up from 60% in 2021.

Only 4% of adults said crypto is the best long-term investment.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/26/crypto-still-seen-as-risky-among-u-s-investors-despite-ownership-surging-8x-since-2018-survey,BUSINESS|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,Finance|Gallup|Bitcoin|Survey|News,BTC,"Crypto Still Seen as ''Risky'' Among U.S. Investors Despite Ownership Surging 8x Since 2018: Survey. Cryptocurrency may be easier to buy than ever, but most Americans still want no part of it. A new Gallup survey found that just 14% of U.S. adults own crypto, a figure that has been growing but still represents a small slice of the investing public. The study, conducted in mid-June, revealed deep skepticism about cryptocurrencies. 60% of respondents said they have no interest in ever buying cryptocurrency, and just 17% admitted they’re intrigued. Only 4% of respondents said they plan on buying crypto in the near future. Gallup also found that among U.S. investors owning more than $10,000 in stocks, bonds or mutual funds, 55% considered the asset class “very risky.” Still, ownership rates skyrocketed from 2% in 2018 to 17%. This skepticism isn''t surprising, despite the U.S. having a pro-crypto president and clearer regulations that have recently been rolling in. While the 2021 bull run ushered in extreme volatility and made crypto a mainstream topic, the subsequent brutal crypto winter, which saw many high-profile bankruptcies, such as FTX, as well as scams and exploits, soured retail investors'' sentiment. Although crypto has since then seen institutional investors jumping into the market, helping it become more legitimate, many retail investors, burned by the past losses, are likely still staying vigilant. Four years ago, Gallup found that 6% of U.S. investors owned cryptocurrency. That figure has since risen but may be conservative, as a Fed survey revealed 12% ownership among U.S. investors. Diving deeper into the ownership, the demographic divide is stark. While one in four men aged 18 to 49 owns crypto, the survey found that ownership drops sharply among women and older adults. College graduates and high-income earners report above-average participation, but seniors and low-income households remain largely absent from the space, the survey shows. Knowledge gaps also persist. Nearly everyone surveyed had heard of crypto, but only 35% said they actually understood how it works. Familiarity was highest among younger men and the wealthier. Even among those who claim to understand crypto, most still call it a risky bet. Among U.S. investors, 64% see the asset class as “very risky,” up from 60% in 2021. The survey found that about one in seven Americans owns crypto, while nearly six in 10 own stocks or real estate. Only 4% of adults said crypto is the best long-term investment."
2025-07-26 22:00:30+00:00,Galaxy Digital Breaks Record With $9 Billion Bitcoin Sale For Estate Planning,"Bitcoin has experienced massive volatility following confirmation that Galaxy Digital executed the sale of 80,000 BTC on behalf of a long-term client. The firm’s July 25 press release revealed that the transaction, one of the largest notional Bitcoin sales in history, was successfully completed and immediately shook the market. The news quickly spread across the crypto space, triggering speculation and sharp price fluctuations. At its peak, Bitcoin recently touched the $123,000 mark, but the announcement spurred heavy selling and raised concerns that this might mark a local top. Short-term holders began realizing losses as the price pulled back, while analysts debated whether this historic exit signals distribution at the top or merely a healthy pause in a longer bull trend. As Galaxy’s role in the transfer becomes clearer, attention turns to the broader implications. Many market participants now wonder if more legacy holders are preparing to exit and what impact this may have on Bitcoin’s path forward. With volatility growing and investor sentiment shaken, all eyes are on how the market absorbs this $9 billion sell-off and whether support levels will hold in the coming days. A Historic Exit: Bitcoin Sale Triggers Market Speculation, Local Top Fear Galaxy Digital has confirmed the successful execution of one of the largest notional Bitcoin transactions in crypto history. The firm completed the sale of more than 80,000 BTC—valued at over $9 billion at current market prices—on behalf of a Satoshi-era investor. According to the company, this historic sale was part of the investor’s broader estate planning strategy, marking one of the earliest and most significant exits from the digital asset market to date. The announcement has sent ripples through the market, not only due to the sheer volume of Bitcoin involved but also due to speculation surrounding the identity of the investor. As details remain confidential, many analysts are debating whether the move signals a shift in market sentiment or simply reflects natural profit-taking after a prolonged bull trend. Some analysts argue that this sale is part of a healthy cycle, where early holders begin to realize gains after years of holding through multiple market cycles. They believe the market has the liquidity and institutional interest to absorb such a sale without long-term damage. However, others interpret the timing and size of the sale as a potential warning sign—a signal that Bitcoin may have reached a local top around the $123K mark. BTC Faces Critical Retest After Breakdown Below Support Bitcoin is trading at $117,407 after briefly dipping below the $115,724 support zone marked on the chart. This level has served as the lower boundary of the range that began forming in early July, with resistance at $122,077.61. The price reacted quickly after the breakdown, reclaiming the 50-day SMA on the 8-hour chart, suggesting the pullback may have been a liquidity sweep rather than a confirmed trend reversal. Volume spiked during the dip, indicating aggressive buying interest near support. However, Bitcoin remains below the 50-SMA ($117,593), which now acts as immediate resistance. The 100-SMA and 200-SMA remain comfortably below, confirming the longer-term bullish structure is intact, though momentum is weakening in the short term. If bulls can push BTC back above the $118,000 area and reclaim range highs, a retest of $122,000 is likely. On the flip side, failure to hold above $115,724 could trigger a drop toward the 100-SMA at $112,548, or even the 200-SMA at $109,436 if selling accelerates.

However, the flagship cryptocurrency dropped to a level just above $115,000 on Friday, July 25. This abrupt decline came with the expected question in the market: Is the rally over? Here’s How $115,000 Could Be Critical To BTC’s Price In a recent post on the social media platform X, crypto pundit Burak Tamaç highlighted the relevance of the region below the $115,000 level for the price of BTC. This on-chain observation, which is based on the BTC Supply Distribution URPD, showed how the Bitcoin price could play out in the near future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Bounce off This Support Level In Reversal Campaign For $121,000 The Supply Distribution URPD metric tracks the amount of Bitcoin supply last moved or transferred at particular price levels. This metric is specifically useful in identifying potential support (demand) and resistance (supply) zones. Tamaç pointed out on X that there is a significant void in Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) distribution just around the $110,000 and $115,000 bracket. What this means is that there have been relatively fewer significant transactions around this price region in the recent past. However, this UTXO gap sits above a price region ($90,000 to $110,000) thick with significant investor activity. Considering the level of activity within this zone, there is an increased likelihood of the premier cryptocurrency finding a support cushion just within the UTXO gap. In this context, the support is to be above the $110,000 price level. As mentioned earlier, after Bitcoin reached a new all-time-high price, the premier cryptocurrency entered a consolidatory phase, where it has moved mostly sideways in the second half of July. During this period of indecisive price action, it can be observed that the Bitcoin price has not gone below the $115,000 price. What this means is that the $110,000 and $115,000 zone is likely where a new UTXO support has been established. If Bitcoin prevails above this price level, we can expect to see continued bullish momentum. On the flip side, if the $110,000 — 115,000 support zone fails, the flagship cryptocurrency might experience a severe sell-off. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, Bitcoin is valued at about $118,050, reflecting an almost 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-26 23:30:17+00:00,"Bull Market Playmakers: Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche Quietly Fuel a Rally Most Are Missing Out On","While headlines obsess over Bitcoin ETF inflows and regulatory battles, a quiet but powerful crypto rally is unfolding under the surface. Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche are quietly posting strong price movements amid renewed accumulation across multiple tiers of the market. However, while blue-chip assets are steadily climbing, the biggest opportunity may lie in a low-cap political meme coin that’s gaining serious traction: Magacoin Finance. Bitcoin (BTC): Quiet Climb, Strong Foundation Bitcoin remains the backbone of the current market structure, climbing from below $100K to a peak of $123,236 before entering a controlled consolidation phase. A bearish engulfing candle near the top suggests some profit-taking, but higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart confirm that bulls are still in control. Support is now building around the $115,000 level, with strategic buyers eyeing this zone for re-entry. A confirmed breakout above $120,000 would likely accelerate momentum back toward the $123K mark and potentially new all-time highs. For many institutions, BTC’s stability is setting the tone for a broader crypto rebound. Uniswap (UNI): Breaking Resistance, Reclaiming Momentum Uniswap recently shattered a key resistance zone between $9.60 and $10.80, signaling a shift in market structure that analysts believe could unlock a 77% upside. With the token now trading above $10.30, the reclaim of this horizontal band marks the end of a prolonged consolidation period that began in early 2024. Volume remains steady, and technical indicators, particularly the Bollinger Band Power (BBP), suggest increased bullish volatility. If UNI continues to hold above the mid-Bollinger Band ($8.22), price targets between $12.83 and $18.40 remain valid in the coming weeks. For traders seeking blue-chip DeFi exposure, Uniswap is now back on the radar. Avalanche (AVAX): A Chain With Real-World Use and DeFi Inflows Avalanche has surged over 40% this month, recently breaking above $24 after reclaiming resistance near the $20 mark. With daily net inflows topping $120 million, surpassing SEI, Sui, and Aptos, AVAX has become the third-highest blockchain in terms of net capital movement. This level of investor activity reflects more than just hype; it shows confidence. Fueling the narrative is real-world utility. The U.S. state of Wyoming recently tested its Avalanche-powered stablecoin pilot, using the network to automate government payments and eliminate 45-day invoice delays. Built on AvaCloud infrastructure, Avalanche’s chain enables smart contract automation for approvals, compliance, and payments, highlighting its institutional appeal. MAGACOIN Finance: The Narrative-Powered Sleeper That May Explode Analysts are eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE as a high-upside altcoin amid major token rallies. Fully decentralized and backed by whale investors, it features audit-verified contracts (HashEx, CertiK) and wallet integration with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet. With over 5,234 verified holders, MAGACOIN is moving from fringe meme to serious contender for Q4 2025. Its capped supply, rapid Telegram growth, and bold branding are attracting those who missed early PEPE and SHIB gains. The final presale phase is almost closed, giving early adopters access to staking multipliers and governance perks before launch. Conclusion: Rotation Season Is Underway Bitcoin, Uniswap, and Avalanche are quietly rallying, signaling renewed market strength, but the real alpha may lie in undervalued tokens yet to break out. MAGACOIN FINANCE gives retail investors a rare mix of decentralization, a potent political narrative, and audited security.

2025-07-27 01:00:59+00:00,Why Is the Crypto Market Crashing Today?,"The cryptocurrency market faced a brutal pullback on Friday, erasing nearly $160 billion in value as the total market cap sank to around $3.84 trillion, according to CoinGecko. This sharp 6.7% decline comes after four straight weeks of bullish momentum, raising questions about whether the recent rally has finally run out of steam. Bitcoin, which had climbed past $120,000, retreated to $115,300, a 2.6% drop in just 24 hours. Ethereum dipped 1.3% to $3,596, while XRP suffered a more severe 3.6% decline, now hovering near $3.07. The sell-off appears linked to a combination of massive liquidations , shifting sentiment, and aggressive moves by major institutional players. Some early-stage tokens, however, are drawing fresh attention from investors seeking outsized returns. One such project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has surfaced on the radar after recent analyst reports identified a 12,300% ROI potential for early adopters. With demand surging and supply access still limited, the project is increasingly being compared to the early growth phases of coins like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN. Galaxy Digital Sell-Off Intensifies Market Pressure Concerns escalated when Galaxy Digital reportedly dumped 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.18 billion, on the market. On-chain data also showed the firm withdrawing $370 million in USDT from exchanges like Binance and Bybit—moves often viewed as preparation for further selling. Shortly after, another 2,850 BTC (worth over $330 million) was transferred to centralized platforms, amplifying fears that the sell-off was far from over. This sparked a wave of panic selling and triggered a series of margin calls across the market. Leverage Wipeout Across Top Coins Over $721 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in just 24 hours. Ethereum led the cascade with $163.9 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at $155.5 million, and XRP with nearly $49 million wiped out. Within a 12-hour stretch, $273 million in long positions were cleared, including a single liquidation on OKX valued at $17.35 million. These forced sell-offs accelerated the downturn and exposed the fragility of overleveraged trading strategies in volatile markets. Sentiment Split: Fearless Buyers or Fools Rushing In? Despite the chaos, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in “Greed” territory, hinting that many retail investors still see this dip as a buy-the-dip opportunity , not the beginning of a larger downturn. Analysts warn, however, that misplaced optimism could deepen the fall if key support zones fail. Technical Breakdown and Institutional Rotation Bitcoin has slipped below a critical support level at $116,000, a zone traders are closely watching for signs of stabilization. Ethereum is facing headwinds from rising validator queues, while XRP risks falling to $2.72 if current momentum persists. Institutional reshuffling may also be adding fuel to the volatility.

The cryptocurrency market faced a brutal pullback on Friday, erasing nearly $160 billion in value as the total market cap sank to around $3.84 trillion, according to CoinGecko. This sharp 6.7% decline comes after four straight weeks of bullish momentum, raising questions about whether the recent rally has finally run out of steam. Bitcoin, which had climbed past $120,000, retreated to $115,300, a 2.6% drop in just 24 hours. Ethereum dipped 1.3% to $3,596, while XRP suffered a more severe 3.6% decline, now hovering near $3.07. The sell-off appears linked to a combination of massive liquidations , shifting sentiment, and aggressive moves by major institutional players. Some early-stage tokens, however, are drawing fresh attention from investors seeking outsized returns. One such project, MAGACOIN FINANCE, has surfaced on the radar after recent analyst reports identified a 12,300% ROI potential for early adopters. With demand surging and supply access still limited, the project is increasingly being compared to the early growth phases of coins like SHIBA INU and DOGECOIN. Galaxy Digital Sell-Off Intensifies Market Pressure Concerns escalated when Galaxy Digital reportedly dumped 10,000 BTC, valued at approximately $1.18 billion, on the market. On-chain data also showed the firm withdrawing $370 million in USDT from exchanges like Binance and Bybit—moves often viewed as preparation for further selling. Shortly after, another 2,850 BTC (worth over $330 million) was transferred to centralized platforms, amplifying fears that the sell-off was far from over. This sparked a wave of panic selling and triggered a series of margin calls across the market. Leverage Wipeout Across Top Coins Over $721 million in leveraged positions were liquidated in just 24 hours. Ethereum led the cascade with $163.9 million in liquidations, followed by Bitcoin at $155.5 million, and XRP with nearly $49 million wiped out. Within a 12-hour stretch, $273 million in long positions were cleared, including a single liquidation on OKX valued at $17.35 million. These forced sell-offs accelerated the downturn and exposed the fragility of overleveraged trading strategies in volatile markets. Sentiment Split: Fearless Buyers or Fools Rushing In? Despite the chaos, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains in “Greed” territory, hinting that many retail investors still see this dip as a buy-the-dip opportunity , not the beginning of a larger downturn. Analysts warn, however, that misplaced optimism could deepen the fall if key support zones fail. Technical Breakdown and Institutional Rotation Bitcoin has slipped below a critical support level at $116,000, a zone traders are closely watching for signs of stabilization. Ethereum is facing headwinds from rising validator queues, while XRP risks falling to $2.72 if current momentum persists. Institutional reshuffling may also be adding fuel to the volatility. Firms like BlackRock and Fidelity are reportedly adjusting allocations, triggering short-term market shocks even as they maintain broader long-term exposure through Bitcoin ETFs. Some altcoins, however, managed to buck the trend. Vine, The Innovation Game, and Pepecoin each posted gains of over 30%, indicating that selective risk appetite still exists within the market.

2025-07-27 01:30:08+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Could Still Tumble Down To $109,000 — This Chart Pattern Suggests So","The Bitcoin price has been quite indecisive in its action over the past week, jumping between the $117,000 and $120,000 consolidation zone in that period. The flagship cryptocurrency, however, came tumbling toward the $115,000 mark following massive coin movements toward centralized exchanges in the past day. Interestingly, a prominent market expert has put forward an even more bearish outlook for the Bitcoin price over the next few weeks. With this latest projection, the price of BTC seems to only be at the beginning of a downward spiral, which could worsen over the coming days. How BTC Price Could Be At Risk Of Extended Decline In a July 25 post on social media platform X, Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Aksel Kibar painted a bearish picture for the Bitcoin price after falling to $115,000 on Friday. According to the analyst, the flagship cryptocurrency could be on its way to around $109,000 in the coming days. Related Reading: This Australian Investment Manager Just Added Bitcoin To Its Treasury, Here’s How Much BTC They’ve Bought Kibar’s bearish stance revolves around the inverse head-and-shoulder pattern on the Bitcoin price chart on the weekly timeframe. The inverse head-and-shoulders pattern is a technical analysis formation characterized by three distinct price troughs, including a lower “head” set between two higher “shoulders.” Typically, the inverse pattern signals a possible bullish breakout and is validated when the price breaches the neckline — a trendline connecting the crests (swing highs) between the head. As shown in the chart below, the Bitcoin price has already broken through the neckline to reach a new all-time high. However, Kibar explained that the price breakout witnessed by Bitcoin might not be the textbook breakout typically expected in most inverse head-and-shoulders pattern scenarios. According to the market expert, most head-and-shoulder breakouts are followed by pullbacks and retests rather than straight rallies. Chart data provided by the analyst shows that, since May 2017, the Bitcoin price has witnessed a retest or pullback (type 2 continuation) more times than a straight rally (type 1 continuation) after a head-and-shoulder pattern breakout. This trend explains the rationale behind Kibar’s bearish projection for BTC in the next few days. If the price of Bitcoin does suffer a deeper correction as in the type 2 continuation, it is likely to return to the neckline — and around the $109,000 mark. A move like this would represent an over 5% decline from the current price point. Bitcoin Price At A Glance After a horrendous start to the day, the market leader seems to be recovering nicely from its recent fall to $115,000. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $117,323, reflecting a mere 0.6% decline in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-27 01:31:02+00:00,XRP Investors Warned as Ripple Co-Founder Moves 50 Million Tokens to Exchanges,"The XRP community is facing fresh warnings after Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen transferred 50 million XRP tokens to exchanges, sparking fears among investors of being used as “exit liquidity.” The transaction triggered a wave of concern from analysts and market watchers who believe the move may be part of a larger sell-off strategy. J.A. Maartunn, a contributor to the on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, weighed in on the situation via social media platform X. “Don’t get dumped on,” Maartunn cautioned. “Don’t be the exit liquidity. Protect yourself.” Massive Holdings Raise Red Flags Larsen’s transfer came just after XRP briefly surged to highs near $3.60 on July 17, approaching its all-time record. Despite the rally, the excitement was quickly tempered by outflows from a wallet linked to Larsen, prompting mixed reactions. Some interpreted the move as normal profit-taking, while others accused him of exploiting the price peak to offload tokens. Maartunn highlighted that the 50 million XRP moved represents only a small portion of Larsen’s reported holdings. According to him, Larsen still holds around 2.58 billion XRP, worth approximately $8.83 billion at current prices. “If $200M was just the warm-up… what’s next?” he asked. Market Pullback After Rally The recent sell-off by Larsen coincided with a broader correction in XRP’s price. After surging as part of a wider altcoin rally—following Bitcoin’s consolidation phase—XRP has pulled back around 13%. It is currently trading at $3.18, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data. The pullback, coupled with Larsen’s wallet activity, has added to investor caution. Other market analysts, including prominent trader ManLy, echoed the concerns about large holders dumping tokens at the expense of retail investors. Comparisons to Bitcoin Whale Activity XRP’s situation mirrors recent volatility seen in the Bitcoin market. Earlier this month, a Satoshi-era whale liquidated 80,000 dormant BTC, sending BTC/USD sharply lower to around $114,500 before bouncing back. Galaxy Digital reportedly handled that transaction, and the sudden move triggered over $500 million in liquidations across the crypto space, according to CoinGlass data. While Bitcoin quickly recovered, the scale of such transactions highlights the ongoing risks faced by cryptocurrency investors when large holders suddenly move their assets. Cautious Sentiment Prevails For now, analysts are urging caution. XRP’s potential for future growth remains intact, but the looming threat of further sell-side pressure from insiders like Larsen may dampen short-term investor enthusiasm. Many in the XRP community are now watching Larsen’s wallet closely, wary of becoming collateral damage in a larger exit strategy.

That news has helped push Bitcoin to even higher levels of dominance, meaning most of the money right now is flowing into Bitcoin rather than altcoins. But as investors start buying during the altcoin dip, popular altcoins like XRP, Sui, and Pudgy Penguins could be on track to hit new all-time highs in the coming week. Bitcoin Dominance May Restrict Altcoins Bitcoin’s dominance has grown a lot in recent weeks, now hovering over 60% of it. As a result, many altcoins have seen their prices drop. If this trend continues, even more money could move into Bitcoin, which might put pressure on altcoins. Still, despite this, top altcoins like XRP, Sui, and PENGU could break out and hit new all-time highs in the coming week. XRP Price Analysis Recently, XRP hit near all-time highs above $3.60, but the achievement was quickly overshadowed by large outflows from a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. Investors face new warnings over becoming “exit liquidity” after Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved 50 million tokens to exchanges. He still has around $9 billion left to sell. XRP/USD If concerns around XRP sell off decline, XRP price might attempt to retest its resistance at $3.6. As of writing, XRP price trades at $3.4, surging over 5.5% in the last 24 hours. The RSI level is currently on a rise, heading toward the midline. If buying demand continues and XRP breaks above $3.6, it might form a new ATH next week. However, a failure to hold above the EMA20 trend line on the 4-hour chart might plunge the open interest, eliminating hopes of a new ATH. Sui Price Analysis SUI soared above the $4.2 resistance, and the bulls have successfully maintained the price above the breakout level. That suggests the buyers are trying to flip the $4.2 level into support. As of writing, SUI trades at $4.3, surging over 13% in the last 24 hours. SUI/USDT If the price breaks above immediate Fib levels, the SUI/USDT pair could continue the uptrend. As a result, SUI price might reach its previous ATH of $5.35. Although the trend remains up, the overbought level on the RSI increases the risk of a correction or consolidation in the near term. If the price dips and closes below $4, the pair could tumble to the 20-day EMA. Pudgy Penguins Price Analysis PENGU price is currently stuck in a tough fight between buyers and sellers around the $0.045 mark. If the price falls and closes below EMA20 level, sellers might push it down to $0.036. PENGU/USDT But if the price bounces strongly from $0.046, it would show that buyers are buying in at resistance levels.

2025-07-27 03:40:53+00:00,Bitcoin Treasuries Become Nationalization Honeypots,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post The industry should be pushing for public awareness on the difference between self-custody and holding your Bitcoin with a third party. Bitcoin treasury companies are potential honeypots for nationalization in a future where the US government is attempting to maintain its dominant role in the global order by seizing BTC amid the US dollar being dropped as the world’s reserve currency. Bitcoin treasury companies hold Bitcoin in their treasury as a reserve asset. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy was the first company to pursue the strategy. Data shows public companies are in possession of one million Bitcoin companies as of mid-2025. Discussions around Bitcoin treasury companies rarely mention financial sovereignty. Bitcoin has generally been used by companies as a means to leverage BTC and boost stock prices. For instance, the Charles Schwab analysis of these companies offer investors a novel way to gain exposure to crypto while diversifying corporate balance sheets, but does not mention financial sovereignty. Schwab wrote, “Strategy made its commitment to cryptocurrency in 2020 and helped create the framework for Bitcoin treasury-holding companies, which can offer another way for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.” Instead of empowering individuals to feel confident holding Bitcoin in a cold wallet, we are giving them easy options in which they do not hold their own private keys. On the contrary, Bitcoin has largely been viewed – e specially by its early adopters – as having the potential to separate money from the state. Whether treasury companies are a tool for liberty has yet to be seen. Early Bitcoin adopters – such as Adam Back – herald Bitcoin treasury companies as bolstering Bitcoin’s role as a global store of value independent of the state. This thesis is unlikely to play out. Bitcoin treasury companies instead are tentacles of the state in a way. They have gone public. Accountants and lawyers answer to regulators and often exercise a lot of power alongside executives within the corporate structure. The truth is simple – Bitcoin treasury companies cannot operate independently of the state. They are the main targets of government scrutiny, which makes them candidates for a nationalization push. The state could easily consider corporate Bitcoin holdings as a threat to fiat currency. Central banks – 90% of them, according to the International Monetary Fund – are developing CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) to preclude the need for Bitcoin as a reserve asset, suggesting governments already see Bitcoin as a threat. If Bitcoin unseats fiat currencies, Bitcoin treasury companies could be nationalized, in which states confiscate corporate assets. There is precedent for such an action – the 1933 US Executive Order 6102 required citizens to turn in their gold to the government. Moreover, the US government has nationalized companies in the past. During World War I and II, the government nationalized railroads, telegraph lines and other industries in order to support war efforts. The US Railroad Administration nationalized railroads between 1917 and 1920. During World War II, coal mines, steel mills and even retailer Montgomery Ward were seized to ensure continued production and prevent disruptions. Montgomery Ward might have been a Bitcoin treasury company if it were under the same leadership as it was at the time of its nationalization. Sewell Avery was the chairman of Montgomery Ward. He refused to comply with the labor union and the War Labor Board’s demands. “To hell with the government,” Avery reportedly yelled in April 1944 when Attorney General Francis Biddle confronted him. “I want none of your damned advice.” Avery sounds like a Bitcoiner. The government has also taken over numerous financial institutions. In 1984, the government took an 80 percent interest in Continental Illinois Bank, which was considered ‘too big to fail.’ During the 1989 Savings and Loan Crisis, the government set up the Resolution Trust Corporation to manage more than 1,000 failed savings and loan institutions. This cost the government more than $125 billion over six years. In the 2008-2009 financial crisis, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under federal conservatorship in 2008. The US government acquired a 60% stake in General Motors in a bankruptcy agreement. Canada took another 12.5%. The Trump Administration has de facto nationalized US steel by retaining significant control over business activities. A considerable share of the US public is pro-nationalization. Activists and policy experts have supported nationalizing fossil fuel companies to combat climate change. The nationalization of healthcare has been spearheaded by mainstream politicians like Bernie Sanders amid 63% of Americans calling for a nationalized system in 2020.

HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post The industry should be pushing for public awareness on the difference between self-custody and holding your Bitcoin with a third party. Bitcoin treasury companies are potential honeypots for nationalization in a future where the US government is attempting to maintain its dominant role in the global order by seizing BTC amid the US dollar being dropped as the world’s reserve currency. Bitcoin treasury companies hold Bitcoin in their treasury as a reserve asset. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy was the first company to pursue the strategy. Data shows public companies are in possession of one million Bitcoin companies as of mid-2025. Discussions around Bitcoin treasury companies rarely mention financial sovereignty. Bitcoin has generally been used by companies as a means to leverage BTC and boost stock prices. For instance, the Charles Schwab analysis of these companies offer investors a novel way to gain exposure to crypto while diversifying corporate balance sheets, but does not mention financial sovereignty. Schwab wrote, “Strategy made its commitment to cryptocurrency in 2020 and helped create the framework for Bitcoin treasury-holding companies, which can offer another way for investors to gain exposure to cryptocurrencies.” Instead of empowering individuals to feel confident holding Bitcoin in a cold wallet, we are giving them easy options in which they do not hold their own private keys.

Corporate Treasury Boom Could Spark Dot-Com Level Mania,"At the time of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading just over $118,000, after recovering from a dip that took it to a two-week low at $114,500 on July 24. But behind the relatively calm price action, a potentially explosive narrative is gathering steam. Proponents say we’re witnessing the most calculated supply shock in crypto history, and when the dust clears, the price of BTC could be headed for the $1 million mark. The Million-Dollar Dream As noted in a July 25 X post by Swan, a Bitcoin-only financial services provider, the current rally, which saw BTC hit a new all-time high recently, is different. It is deliberate, calculated, and rather underhyped. “This is the least euphoric bull market we’ve ever seen,” Swan posted. “And that’s bullish.” Their premise? Corporate treasuries and spot-exchange traded funds are quietly soaking up BTC through algorithmic “drip buys.” These aren’t degens gambling on meme coins but CFOs and CIOs diversifying balance sheets while retail sleeps. “Each breakout removes coins from weak hands, then resets.” Swan calls it “deliberate absorption,” and it’s keeping price action deceptively stable , at least for now. However, crypto influencer American HODL thinks the dam is about to burst. He believes that once enough corporate balance sheets start showing BTC as a strategic reserve asset, boardrooms around the world will scramble to keep up, just like they did during the internet boom in 1999. “I think the treasury company bubble can get dot-com level large,” he said in a recent podcast. “We could see a 3–4 year run that takes Bitcoin well beyond a million dollars.” Roadmap to $1 Million To support their view, Swan researchers laid out a four-phase blueprint they believe is already in motion: Quiet corporate absorption via algorithmic buys Sovereigns stacking Bitcoin under the radar Major treasury firms finalizing structures for maximum bidding Narrative contagion that ignites a multi-year melt-up “That’s the setup for a mania-fueled blow-off top pushing toward $1M Bitcoin,” the firm stated. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied from $42,000 to $123,000 during a historic tightening cycle, and Swan is asking, what happens when cheap money actually returns?

Built by the National Data Association and overseen by the Ministry of Public Security’s Data Innovation and Exploitation Center, the system will serve as the main verification layer for everything from hospital records to school transcripts and supply‑chain logs. Centralized-Decentralized System Based on reports , NDAChain uses a hybrid model. It relies on a Proof‑of‑Authority consensus, which means only approved nodes can validate transactions. At the same time, it adds Zero‑Knowledge Proofs to keep sensitive data private while still confirming its authenticity. Officials say the network can process between 1,200 to 3,600 transactions per second, a figure aimed at supporting fast checks in e‑government, logistics and other areas.

NDA DID provides digital IDs that tie into Vietnam’s existing VNeID setup. Citizens will be able to verify identities online when they sign documents or access services. NDATrace offers end‑to‑end product tracking using GS1 and EBSI Trace standards. Items get unique identifiers, which can be scanned by QR codes or RFID chips. This should help businesses prove authenticity to overseas buyers and simplify recalls if problems arise. Protection And Privacy Layer According to Nguyen Huy, Head of Technology at the National Data Association, NDAChain acts as a “protective layer” for Vietnam’s digital infrastructure. It’s designed to scale as data volume grows. Digital records—like medical files or student transcripts—can be checked without exposing personal details, thanks to the added privacy tools. At the same time, the permissioned setup gives authorities more control over who joins the network. Phased Rollout And Future Plans Based on reports, full integration with the National Data Center is set for completion by December 31, 2025. After that, the focus will shift to local agencies and universities, with industry‑specific Layer 2 apps planned in 2026. Potential applications include identity wallets, counterfeit prevention systems and digital notaries. These add‑on apps will run on top of NDAChain without changing the core network.

2025-07-27 07:00:34+00:00,"Satoshi-Era Whale Completes $9,300,000,000 Bitcoin Dump Through Galaxy Digital in One of the Biggest Whale Transactions Ever","A Bitcoin whale wallet with a 14-year history has just sold off its coins in one of the biggest BTC transactions in history. In a press release , the crypto financial services giant Galaxy Digital says that it facilitated the successful execution of “one of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto” on behalf of one of the firm’s clients. Galaxy says the transaction involved Bitcoin worth about $9.3 billion at current prices. Says Galaxy, “Galaxy completed the sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin – valued at over $9 billion based on current market prices – for a Satoshi-era investor, representing one of the earliest and most significant exits from the digital asset market. The transaction was part of the investor’s broader estate planning strategy.” In a post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says that the entity that sold its coins had a wallet that originated from MyBitcoin, one of the earliest Bitcoin exchange and wallet services. In 2011, MyBitcoin suddenly shut down and explained that it had been hacked. The exchange only reimbursed its customers for 49% of their losses, suggesting that the rest was lost to the hack. Says Ju, “The recent transfer of 80,000 BTC, dormant for 14 years, came from wallets originally hosted by MyBitcoin. The wallets had been inactive since April 2011, before MyBitcoin collapsed in a hack that July. It likely belongs to the hacker or the anonymous founder known as Tom Williams.

A Bitcoin whale wallet with a 14-year history has just sold off its coins in one of the biggest BTC transactions in history. In a press release , the crypto financial services giant Galaxy Digital says that it facilitated the successful execution of “one of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto” on behalf of one of the firm’s clients. Galaxy says the transaction involved Bitcoin worth about $9.3 billion at current prices. Says Galaxy, “Galaxy completed the sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin – valued at over $9 billion based on current market prices – for a Satoshi-era investor, representing one of the earliest and most significant exits from the digital asset market. The transaction was part of the investor’s broader estate planning strategy.” In a post on the social media platform X, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says that the entity that sold its coins had a wallet that originated from MyBitcoin, one of the earliest Bitcoin exchange and wallet services. In 2011, MyBitcoin suddenly shut down and explained that it had been hacked. The exchange only reimbursed its customers for 49% of their losses, suggesting that the rest was lost to the hack. Says Ju, “The recent transfer of 80,000 BTC, dormant for 14 years, came from wallets originally hosted by MyBitcoin. The wallets had been inactive since April 2011, before MyBitcoin collapsed in a hack that July. It likely belongs to the hacker or the anonymous founder known as Tom Williams. It seems Galaxy Digital bought the Bitcoin from them, but I’m not sure if they did any forensics.” At the time of the hack, BTC was trading for around $13 a coin, meaning that the whale saw roughly a 922,976% return on its investment if sold around the $120,000 mark.

2025-07-27 07:04:18+00:00,"$7,800,000,000 Asset Manager Piles Into Three Assets, Outlines Several ‘Massive’ Industry Disruptors","The CEO of a $7.8 billion asset manager says his firm is investing in three companies poised to drive transformative advancements in healthcare, financial data and AI. Aureus Asset Management chief executive Thad Davis tells Barron’s that his firm has piled into Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), believing that the firm is in a position to become the “Amazon-type” supplier for healthcare firms. “It provides all the materials, equipment and supplies a lab environment would need. If you ever watch the dollies that come in and out of a hospital or biotech building, they are loaded with Thermo Fisher equipment.” The next pick is Applied Materials (AMAT), which plays a critical role in the development of powerful chips amid the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI). While Nvidia currently leads in chip manufacturing, Davis says Applied Materials is essential across four critical stages of chip production, ensuring its equipment remains indispensable for leading-edge chip development, driving significant long-term demand regardless of which company ultimately dominates the market. Lastly, Davis says the firm is a believer in S&P Global (SPGI), noting that it holds a dominant position in the credit ratings market alongside Moody’s, forming a near duopoly. Overall, Davis also says that Aureus is keeping a close watch on three investment areas that have the potential to become “massive disruptors,” including AI, blockchain along with crypto and GLP-1 drugs – medicines designed to treat diabetes and obesity. “Each taken separately has the capacity to profoundly disrupt various industries. But some taken together could have the same impact. GLP-1s and AI might be amazingly helpful in revolutionizing therapeutic developments, for example.” Aureus is a Boston-based wealth management firm serving high-net-worth individuals, families and institutions.

Krueger, in a brief post, asserted that “Not one actual human being is using XRP. Not one.” In response, SMQKE dismissed this statement as factually incorrect, posting, “’No one’ uses XRP… except for hundreds of financial institutions like American Express, Bank of America, and Santander. But don’t let facts get in the way of a good narrative.” SMQKE’s reply was accompanied by a screenshot of a cryptocurrency adoption chart showing documented institutional use of XRP, distinguishing his position with publicly available data. Reference to Documented Institutional Use The image shared by SMQKE originated from a comparative overview of top cryptocurrencies and their recent use cases. It highlights XRP’s role as a bridge currency for cross-border payments and settlement within Ripple’s infrastructure. The document states that hundreds of financial institutions, including American Express, Bank of America, and Santander, maintain partnerships with Ripple, leveraging XRP within their operations. It further notes that Ripple has collaborated with global sustainability leaders such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and has committed to achieving carbon net zero by 2030. This counters Krueger’s claim by presenting a factual account of large-scale adoption by corporate and financial institutions. While the use of XRP by individual retail investors or consumers may vary, SMQKE’s emphasis was on institutional adoption, which is clearly outlined in the source material he provided. “No one” uses XRP… except for hundreds of financial institutions like American Express, Bank of America, and Santander.

By presenting verifiable data, he rejects the notion that XRP is unused or irrelevant. His response focuses on the mismatch between the narrative pushed by some investors and the factual evidence of adoption by major financial institutions. It also reflects a broader dynamic in the crypto sector where public perception often diverges from enterprise applications, particularly with utility-driven tokens like XRP that may not be as visible in consumer-facing environments but remain active in backend financial systems. Krueger’s generalization that “not one actual human being is using XRP” appears to ignore this distinction. SMQKE’s counterposition centers the institutional framework in which XRP operates, distinguishing it from cryptocurrencies that are primarily retail-focused.

Avalanche Price Declines But User Engagement Soars A recent analysis from data firm Messari revealed that AVAX’s price fell 4.2% quarter-over-quarter, dropping from $18.77 to $17.99. This decline came alongside a 2.6% decrease in its circulating market cap, which fell from $7.8 billion to $7.6 billion. The impact of this price drop was also reflected in AVAX’s market ranking, which fell from 15th to 16th among all cryptocurrencies. However, not all metrics were negative. Transaction fees for AVAX surged by nearly 29% during the quarter, increasing from 58,300 to 75,170. In terms of revenue, transaction fees in USD also rose slightly, going from $1.50 million to $1.54 million, indicating a growing user base and increased activity on the platform. Related Reading: Is $1 Dogecoin ‚Inevitable‘? Analyst Cites Perfect Storm Of Factors A particularly bright spot for Avalanche in Q2 2025 was the significant growth in daily transactions across its C-Chain and other layer-1s. Average daily transactions skyrocketed by 169.91%, reaching 10.1 million compared to 3.7 million in the previous quarter. This was complemented by a dramatic increase in daily active addresses, which surged by 210.45% to 519,954, suggesting a robust uptick in user engagement. In line with this growth, Avalanche also reduced its average transaction fees by 42.7%, from $0.05 to $0.03. This reduction is largely attributed to the Octane upgrade, which introduced a dynamic fee mechanism on Avalanche’s C-Chain, allowing for real-time fee adjustments to enhance user experience and reduce costs. C-Chain Transactions And DeFi TVL Soar The C-Chain in particular saw impressive usage growth, with average daily transactions jumping 493.4% from 244,995 at the end of Q1 to 1.4 million by the end of Q2. Daily active addresses also experienced a healthy increase of 57% quarter-over-quarter, rising from 29,554 to 46,397. Notably, there was a spike to 419,619 daily active addresses on May 11. As seen in the chart above, Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) rose 37.1%, climbing from $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion. However, the stablecoin market cap on Avalanche saw a significant decline of 23.8%, dropping from $1.9 billion to $1.5 billion. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000 The rise in daily active addresses across Avalanche’s layer-1 platforms was particularly noteworthy. The average daily active addresses surged by 444.8% quarter-over-quarter, from 68,723 to 374,402. As of this writing, AVAX’s price has recovered from Q2 lows toward the $23 zone, rising 35% in the past thirty days due to the recent bullish sentiment that led Bitcoin (BTC), the market’s leading crypto, to reach a new all-time high above $123,000.

Documents filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by the company indicate that XRP has been integrated into its business model. Ripple advocate and attorney Bill Morgan commented on the SEC document, saying, “This S-1 filing lays out a strategy to integrate XRP not just as an asset but into the company''s financial and operational structure.” According to Morgan, Welgistics Health aims to utilize the XRP Ledger infrastructure to process transactions with pharmacy customers and manufacturing and distribution partners in a cost-effective and real-time manner. This initiative is cited as an example of the real-world use of XRP in business-to-business payments.

The company intends to use the acquired XRP as collateral to raise funds and profit from XRP-based transactions.

2025-07-27 08:24:45+00:00,$9 Billion Exit by Satoshi-Era BTC Whale Sparks Debate: Are Bitcoin OGs Losing Faith?,"Bitcoin’s identity crisis came roaring back into focus this weekend after Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced that it had facilitated a $9 billion sale of more than 80,000 bitcoin for a Satoshi-era investor. The firm said the sale — one of the largest notional BTC transactions ever—was part of the seller’s estate planning strategy. The transaction was immediately seen as symbolic. For some, it marked a practical rebalancing. For others, it was a worrying sign that even Bitcoin’s earliest believers are cashing out. Crypto analyst and commentator Scott Melker fanned the flames with a sharply worded post on X. “Bitcoin is amazing,” he wrote on July 26. “But it’s obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against. Many of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices.” The comment kicked off a fierce debate that spanned crypto influencers, traders, and ideologues — many of whom disagreed sharply over what the whale’s exit meant, and whether Melker’s framing was accurate. Some Dismiss the Concern Critics of Melker’s interpretation argued that one transaction — egardless of size — doesn’t signify ideological abandonment. They noted the sale was explicitly tied to estate planning, not a loss of conviction. Others pointed out that wallet movements can be misleading, and selling doesn’t automatically mean an investor has given up on the asset long term. Some community members even called the remark speculative, pointing to OGs like Adam Back and others who continue to accumulate. Melker later clarified that he was “just pointing out what I’ve been hearing,” not declaring his own view. Others See a Pattern Supporters of Melker’s take saw the whale’s exit as emblematic of a broader shift. With Bitcoin increasingly absorbed into traditional finance — via ETFs, corporate treasuries, and custody solutions — some worry that the asset has drifted from its cypherpunk roots. To this group, Bitcoin’s transformation into a tradable, regulated, and largely off-chain instrument is a distortion of its founding vision. If early believers are losing interest, they argue, it may be a symptom of Bitcoin becoming less about individual sovereignty and more about financial engineering. Bitcoin’s Open-Access Design Defended Another group pushed back against the premise that institutional involvement amounts to ideological failure. In their view, Bitcoin’s value lies in its neutrality — its rules apply to everyone, whether it’s retail users or Wall Street funds. Censorship resistance, not exclusion, is the foundation. These commentators argued that the rise of ETFs and custodial adoption was inevitable, and even necessary, if Bitcoin is to achieve broad monetary relevance. From this perspective, whale exits are simply a part of maturing capital flows — not a sign of philosophical surrender. Questions About Security and Use The debate also triggered deeper concerns about Bitcoin’s function. If most BTC is held as a passive store of value and rarely transacted, how will the network continue to be secured post-halving? With mining rewards falling and on-chain usage declining, some worry that transaction fees alone may not sustain network integrity in the long run. A Telling Moment While Melker’s post didn’t move markets, it did spotlight a critical question: What does it mean when early believers sell? Is it a warning signal, or a natural redistribution? A loss of faith — or a sign of progress? Galaxy’s $9 billion transaction offered no definitive answers. But the reactions that followed revealed just how unsettled Bitcoin’s evolving role remains.

2025-07-27 08:30:37+00:00,Bitcoin Endures One Of The Most Intense Bear Weeks Of This Bull Cycle – Details,"Bitcoin experienced heightened volatility on Friday, briefly dipping to a local low of around $114,700 before stabilizing within a tight consolidation range. The price remains capped below the psychological $120,000 mark, with bulls and bears locked in a tug-of-war that has intensified speculation across the market. Despite the pullback, Bitcoin is holding key support, suggesting resilience in the current bullish structure. Related Reading: TRON Drops Q2 Report: Revenue, USDT Dominance Lead Multi-Quarter Highs According to CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler, this week stands out as one of the most aggressive selling periods of the current bull cycle. Adler notes that only 12 weeks—about 7.3% of the entire cycle—have shown equal or greater selling pressure. This context highlights just how intense the recent market activity has been, with significant profit-taking from investors but no full breakdown in price. The combination of strong selling and price stability has introduced a high level of uncertainty. Market participants are watching closely for confirmation of either a deeper correction or a renewed push to break the $120K barrier. As the week closes, Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its consolidation range could determine the pace and direction of the next major move in this cycle. Bitcoin Holds Strong Amid Heavy Selling Adler highlighted that this week ranks among the top 7% of the most extreme in terms of selling volume during the current Bitcoin bull cycle. Despite the intense selling pressure, Bitcoin has shown notable resilience, recovering to $117,000 by week’s end. This rebound is seen as a positive signal, reflecting bullish strength in the face of aggressive distribution. While Bitcoin remains in a tight consolidation range, its dominance is starting to weaken relative to Ethereum and other major altcoins. This shift has caught the attention of analysts who now view this week as a pivotal moment. A continued decrease in Bitcoin dominance paired with growing strength in altcoins could mark the beginning of the long-anticipated altseason—a period where capital rotates from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies, driving strong gains across the sector. Still, Bitcoin’s recent recovery and consolidation above key support suggest that its bullish momentum may not be over. If buyers continue to defend the current range, BTC could be gearing up for another leg higher, putting pressure on shorts and reigniting market confidence.

This area has proven to be a critical short-term demand zone, with bulls stepping in aggressively to defend it following a recent dip. The price is now pressing against the 100-period SMA ($117,822), attempting to reclaim this level as support. The structure of the chart shows BTC remains locked in a well-defined consolidation range between $115,724 and $122,077.

2025-07-27 08:40:33+00:00,"Solo Bitcoin miner successfully mines a block, earns 3.125 BTC","A solo Bitcoin miner has successfully mined a block on Saturday, earning the coveted 3.125 BTC block reward worth $372,773. The miner was operating through the Solo CK pool, a solo mining service. According to details, he successfully mined block 907,283, which contained 4,038 transactions, paying block fees of about $3,436. Over the last few years, it has been hard for solo Bitcoin miners to compete with large-scale, corporate mining firms. This is largely due to the increase in network hashrate and difficulty, making the scene very competitive. However, despite this competition, some solo miners have been recorded some degree of success this year, mining solo blocks at intervals since the beginning of the year. Solo Bitcoin miners record success The victories recorded by solo miners are a reminder that even though improbable and nearly impossible, they can still be successful in the industry. There have been several cases this year where some of them have come out on top when it comes to mining, taking the full reward. For instance, the first successfully mined solo block this year happened in February, with the miner solving block number 883,181 and winning 3.125 BTC worth $300,000. According to Bitcoin block explorer Mempool.space, the block contained 3,071 transactions and a total reward of 3.15 BTC. In a post announcing the development, Bitcoin miner Marshall Long speculated that the miner might have used a Bitaxe, a mining device that can be used for solo mining or mining pools where miners combine computational power to increase their chances of solving a block. In March, another solo Bitcoin miner solved block number 887,212, winning about 3.15 BTC, which was worth around $263,000 at the time. What made this incident spectacular is that the miner used a 480 GH/s Bitaxe device to solve the block. This month, there have been two solo miners who have gone all the way. The first, which happened on July 4, saw the miner earn 3.173 BTC worth $330,000 after mining block number 899,826. The second, which happened on July 12, saw the miner win 3.154 BTC after solving number 904,989. Rise in network difficulty poses challenges to professional mining firms Over the last few months, there has been a rise in network difficulty and hashrate, coupled with a drop in block subsidy. These developments have posed challenges to established mining firms. Most of them have now diversified their large mining operations into AI data centers and high-performance computing to make up for the losses racked up in the mining business amid a rise in competition. Bitcoin network difficulty is currently about 126 trillion, which is close to its all-time high levels. Its network difficulty has also been trending up over the last few days, forcing miners to use greater computing and power resources to mine blocks. Presently, miners earn a 3.125 BTC reward worth around $373,000 from a single block at current prices. The competition in the industry puts them on edge, pushing them to find the cheapest energy resources. In June, several Bitcoin miners located in Texas were forced to reduce their energy consumption to avoid paying peak demand charges to the grid operator. This caused a drop in block production in the short term. Last month, MARA was one of the firms affected by the weather conditions, reporting lower power output numbers due to its slowed mining operations.

The experienced strategist clearly stated that the real reason behind his preference for Ethereum was the growth in the stablecoin sector. Tom Lee, a long-time chief strategist at JPMorgan Chase, is known among US investors for his accurate predictions of market trends and frequent appearances on major media platforms like CNBC. However, he has also been the target of criticism for his consistently optimistic approach to the market. In the podcast, Lee also touched on the characteristics of the era in which today''s individual investors find themselves, attributing the change in this period to two main factors: the visibility provided to startups by independent media channels that came with the rise of social media, especially Twitter, and the resurgence of investor optimism about stocks that occurs every 20 years in the US.

Lee, known for his strong support for cryptocurrencies, was recently appointed chairman of Bitmine and played an active role in the company''s $250 million Ethereum treasury strategy. This move resonated heavily in the crypto market. While he praised Ethereum for its technical aspects, Lee explained the main reason: “I love Ethereum because it''s a programmable smart contract blockchain.

In a new post on the social media platform X, the Rich Dad Poor Dad author refers to Bitcoin ETF shares as “paper,” emphasizing that it’s still better to own the real asset directly rather than depend on institutions for exposure. “BEWARE of PAPER. I realize ETFs make investing easier for the average investor….so I do recommend ETFs for the average investor. Yet I extend these words of caution. For the average investor, I recommend: Gold ETFs Silver ETFs Bitcoin ETFs Yet an ETF is like having a picture of a gun for personal defense. Sometimes it’s best to have real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a gun. Know the differences when it is best to have real and when it’s best to have paper. If you know the differences and how to use them…. you’re better than average. Take care.” Kiyosaki’s warning comes amid an explosion in the market cap of all Bitcoin ETFs. The latest numbers from the crypto data aggregator Coinglass show that Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold a market cap of $152.73 billion. At the top of the list is BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) with a market cap of $86.11 billion, followed by Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) with market caps of $23.14 billion and $21.33 billion, respectively.

2025-07-27 09:35:44+00:00,Bitcoin Takes a Backseat as Investors Rotate Capital to ETH and Altcoins: CryptoQuant,"The crypto market is witnessing early signs of a brewing altcoin season. Ether (ETH) has been outperforming bitcoin (BTC), a sign that investors are beginning to rotate capital from the latter to the former. According to a weekly CryptoQuant report , a continuation of the current market trend could lead to a full-blown altseason, where bitcoin stalls and altcoins take off, raking in massive gains for investors. Investors Rotate capital to Altcoins For most of this bull cycle, ETH has underperformed against BTC. However, the situation has reversed. The relative price of ETH to BTC has surged from 0.018 to 0.031, reaching its highest level since January 24. The shift in ETH performance started after the ETH/BTC Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio fell into the extremely undervalued territory in April. This ratio has acted as resistance since early 2023. ETH has now recovered and outperformed BTC by 72%. CryptoQuant analysts suggest that the ratio could rise further if it surpasses its 365-day moving average, with ETH potentially outperforming BTC even more. With ETH receiving more capital now, the asset’s spot trading volume is exceeding that of bitcoin’s. For the first time in more than a year, the weekly spot trading volume for ETH surpassed that of bitcoin. ETH recorded $25.7 billion last week, while BTC saw $24.4 billion within the same period. Analysts revealed that this is the first time since June 2024 that ether’s weekly spot trading volume has exceeded bitcoin’s. This means the ETH/BTC trading ratio is above 1. Overall altcoin trading volume has increased to the highest level since March. This metric totaled $67 billion on July 17, a figure the market has not seen since March 2. The growth indicates a renewed interest in altcoins among investors. ETH Sees Less Selling Pressure Than BTC Furthermore, crypto investors are injecting more capital into U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) compared to their Bitcoin counterparts. Ethereum ETF allocations are growing faster than Bitcoin’s, as seen in the ETH/BTC ETF Holding Ratio climbing from 0.05 to 0.12. Meanwhile, the ETH/BTC exchange inflow ratio, which measures selling pressure for the two assets, declined in May to its lowest level since 2020. The drop signaled that ETH was facing much lower selling pressure than BTC. Although the ratio has increased since then, it is still far from extremely high levels, which is a bullish signal – ETH could continue to outperform BTC.

2025-07-27 10:00:46+00:00,Crypto microloans make a comeback as Trump backs crypto,"Crypto microloans are experiencing a dramatic resurgence, fueled by a broader revival in digital asset markets closely tied to US President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance. Three years after a devastating market crash triggered a wave of bankruptcies across the crypto lending sector , a new crop of startups is aggressively re-entering the space. They possess unsecured, tech-driven lending models — and no collateral required. These ventures are riding a wave of investor optimism reignited by Trump’s pro-crypto agenda and the sharp rebound in the broader crypto market. At the forefront is Divine Research, a San Francisco-based firm that has issued more than 30,000 uncollateralized microloans since December. Working alongside OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s eye-scanning crypto identity project , Worldcoin, Divine says it’s helping individuals excluded from traditional finance access short-term loans under $1,000, denominated in Circle’s USDC stablecoin. According to Diego Estevez, Divine’s founder, this is microfinance on steroids. He continued to say that they were lending to everyone from high-school teachers to fruit vendors — anyone with internet access. Divine’s model hinges on Worldcoin’s biometric verification. Once a borrower scans their iris, the system ensures they can’t re-enter the platform under a new identity if they default. Despite default rates of 40% on first-time loans, Estevez claims high interest rates of 20–30% and partially reclaimable tokens balance the risk. He also said individual depositors fund the loans, incentivized by promises of consistent yields. Crypto credit startups embrace programmable trust and AI Divine isn’t alone. 3Jane, a crypto credit startup backed by Paradigm (an early FTX investor), recently raised $5.2 million in seed funding. It offers unsecured USDC credit lines via Ethereum smart contracts, though it requires “verifiable proofs” of financial standing — such as bank statements or crypto holdings — rather than collateral. The firm sells defaulted loans to US debt collectors and is working on AI-powered agents that obey debt covenants automatically, potentially allowing lower interest rates. Meanwhile, Wildcat, another rising protocol, caters to market makers and crypto trading firms by offering customized, undercollateralized credit facilities. Over $170 million has already been lent through its Ethereum-based platform. Like competitors Clearpool and TrueFi, Wildcat allows borrowers to define terms like maturity and loan caps, while lenders self-organize in case of default. “We’re seeing a shift toward programmable trust,” said Evgeny Gaevoy, Wildcat adviser and Wintermute CEO. “In the absence of collateral, reputation and transparency become everything.” Wall Street, AI, and biometrics fuel high-stakes reboot of crypto lending The crypto lending revival comes as Bitcoin prices hit new highs and traditional finance warms to digital assets. Cantor Fitzgerald recently launched a $2 billion “Bitcoin Financing Business”, and JPMorgan is reportedly exploring crypto-backed loans. Even Coinbase is experimenting with AI agents embedded with crypto wallets, developed in collaboration with Altman’s OpenAI, that could one day autonomously manage loans and repayments. Still, memories of the 2022 crypto lending crash — marked by the collapses of Celsius and Genesis — loom large. Celsius’s CEO, Alex Mashinsky, is serving 12 years for fraud, while Genesis agreed to a $2 billion settlement in a lawsuit over defrauding 230,000 investors. Despite those risks, startups like Divine are betting that biometrics, blockchain, and AI can reboot crypto credit models for a new era where loans aren’t backed by assets, but by identity, algorithmic enforcement, and yield-seeking investors.

2025-07-27 10:24:07+00:00,"The First 32,000 Blocks of the Ripple (XRP) Network Are Missing: Ripple Manager Makes a Statement","Ripple''s chief technology officer (CTO) David Schwartz made important statements regarding the block loss issue in the XRP Ledger, which has resurfaced in the XRP community. Schwartz stated that there was a software error during the initial development phase and approximately 32,000 blocks were lost because of it. The XRP Ledger, the blockchain network that underpins the XRP coin, does not contain data from the first 32,000 blocks. This has led to some claims that the block records may have been intentionally deleted. Regarding this loss, which sparked debate within the community, Schwartz maintained in a social media post that the block loss in question was not intentional. Related News: Critical Levels in Bitcoin Have Been Set - What Levels Must Be Exceeded for an Explosive Uptrend? What Level Is Important to Prevent a Decline? Schwartz said, “Existing data wasn''t deleted to prevent further loss. There was no way to recover the lost data.” He also responded to the question of why the blockchain wasn''t reset at the time: “Resetting the blockchain would have erased all data beyond block 32,000, rather than ensuring the integrity of the data.” Records on the XRP Ledger currently begin at block number 32,570, meaning that approximately 32,000 blocks from the first 10 days of the blockchain—a significant transaction history—have been irretrievably lost. Schwartz stated that this technical issue was first raised in May, and that the data loss occurred due to a software error while testing several ledger streams during early development. Although a plan to reset the system was made after the error was identified, this step was never implemented. As a result, the Ripple team decided to continue the system in its current form to ensure the security of subsequent blocks, even at the cost of losing the first ones. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-27 11:03:38+00:00,"Ripple’s Chris Larsen Still Holds 2.58B XRP, Analyst Warns of Potential Sell Pressure","XRP investors are raising red flags after a wallet linked to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen sent 50 million XRP to exchanges, a move that some fear could signal the start of broader sell pressure. Key Takeaways: Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved 50M XRP to exchanges, sparking fears of a broader sell-off. Larsen still holds 2.58B XRP, leading analysts to warn that more sell pressure could follow. XRP dropped 13% amid market volatility, adding to investor concerns about insider activity. The transaction came just days after XRP surged to near all-time highs above $3.60 on July 17. However, the rally was quickly overshadowed by Larsen’s wallet activity, prompting mixed reactions online. Some interpreted the move as a logical profit-taking step, while others saw it as a warning sign. CryptoQuant Analyst Warns XRP Holders: “Don’t Get Dumped On” J.A. Maartunn, an analyst at on-chain data platform CryptoQuant, cautioned followers on X, warning XRP holders not to “get dumped on.” He pointed to Larsen’s massive remaining XRP balance as a looming risk. According to Maartunn, the Ripple co-founder still holds approximately 2.58 billion XRP — currently valued at $8.83 billion — making the 50 million token outflow a mere fraction of his total holdings. “If $200 million was just the warm-up… what’s next?” Maartunn asked, urging traders to “protect yourself” and avoid becoming exit liquidity. XRP has since corrected 13%, now trading at $3.18, according to data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView. The drop came amid wider market jitters as Bitcoin briefly plunged to $114,500 after a dormant Satoshi-era wallet moved 80,000 BTC for the first time in 14 years. The transaction, processed by Galaxy Digital, triggered over $500 million in crypto liquidations within 24 hours, per CoinGlass. Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP — that’s $8.83B. If $200M was just the warm-up… what’s next? Don’t get dumped on. Don’t be the exit liquidity.

With billions of tokens still under Larsen’s control, market participants are watching closely for signs of further distribution, and the potential impact on XRP price momentum. XRP Perpetual Futures Open Interest Hits Record $8.8B XRP saw a spike in notional open interest for its perpetual futures contracts last week. Notional open interest, the total value of leveraged positions held by traders, climbed to an all-time high of $8.8 billion , according to CoinGlass. The figure corresponds to nearly 2.9 billion XRP in open contracts. The previous record for XRP notional open interest stood at $8.3 billion, which was hit in late January before the start of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Across most venues, XRP’s funding rate was positive and climbing, signaling a market where longs are willing to pay shorts to maintain positions, a classic indicator of bullish sentiment. As reported, the number of wallets holding at least 1 million XRP tokens has also surged to an all-time high . Data shows that wallets holding 1 million or more XRP collectively control over 47.32 billion tokens.

Despite a 29.61% drop in 24-hour volume, overall sentiment leans bullish with the Fear & Greed Index at a greed-driven score of 64. The Altcoin Season Index sits at 42/100, showing a tilt toward Bitcoin dominance. The gain in market has been supported by institutional inflows, ongoing FTX creditor repayments, and bullish DeFi developments. Investors are eyeing two major events next week that could reshape sentiment: the FOMC meeting (July 29–30), expected to address rate policies and macroeconomics, and the SEC decision on the Bitwise BITW ETF on July 31. Join me as I dive into the charts for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price prediction for next week. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction Bitcoin is trading sideways just above its 20-day SMA at $117,176, reflecting a period of consolidation. The Bollinger Bands are narrowing, suggesting a potential breakout soon. RSI sits at 60.62, showing neither extreme overbought nor oversold conditions. On the upside, BTC faces a tough resistance at $123,680 , a level it failed to breach earlier this month. If bulls can push above this, the next leg could test $127,000. Conversely, a break below the support at $111,964 could expose BTC to $108,000. Next Week Target Range: $115,000 – $123,680 Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction Ethereum remains one of the strongest performers. It continues to trade in an uptrend channel with solid support at $3,550. The RSI is elevated at 79.69, hinting at slight overbought conditions but still backed by strong momentum. Price is hovering just below the $4,096 resistance zone. If ETH breaks above $4,100, we could see a run to $4,250 . However, if rejection occurs again, a pullback to $3,600–$3,550 seems likely. Next Week Target Range: $3,600 – $4,250 XRP Price Prediction XRP recently saw a bounce from the $2.8497 support zone after a correction from its $3.49 resistance. The RSI is cooling down from an overbought 76.12 to 62.02, suggesting room for a fresh move upward. Bollinger Bands show XRP attempting to consolidate above the 20-SMA at $3.0589. If bulls manage to reclaim $3.49, XRP could retest $3.60 next week. However, failure to maintain above $3.05 may drive it back toward $2.85. Next Week Target Range: $2.85 – $3.49 FAQs Can Bitcoin hit a new ATH next week? Bitcoin is consolidating near resistance. A decisive breakout above $123,680 could open the door to $127k, but momentum must pick up. Will the ETH price hit $4,000 soon? Yes, ETH is approaching the $4,100 resistance.

2025-07-27 11:34:39+00:00,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Satoshi-Era Whale Exit Fuels Volatility — What’s Next?,"Bitcoin price faces intense volatility following a historic $9.7 billion exit by a Satoshi-era whale who held coins since 2011, with Galaxy Digital facilitating the massive liquidation across multiple exchanges. The whale transferred over 80,000 BTC in batches, triggering a sharp 4.21% weekly decline to $115,444 as Galaxy distributed over 17,123 BTC worth $1.98 billion to major exchanges , including Binance, Coinbase, and OKX. Notably, analysis suggests that the sales may be connected to a hacker who took control of a whale wallet and facilitated sales through Galaxy Digital. Despite fears of market disruption, analysts suggest the selling pressure may be absorbed without significant long-term impact. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju notes that “old whales sell to new long-term whales,” indicating institutional adoption is reshaping traditional market dynamics. Technical analysis reveals that Bitcoin is recovering from classic bull trap psychology while forming a falling wedge pattern, targeting breakout levels of $125,000, with institutional buyers, including BlackRock and MicroStrategy, actively absorbing the distribution. $BTC just followed the emotional cycle to the letter. First the bull trap. Then the fear flush. Everyone bullish → then panic → then silence. This is how major moves start: max pain, max confusion.

Source: Captain Faibik on X The falling wedge represents one of the most reliable bullish reversal patterns, with declining highs and lows converging toward resolution. The blue projection line extending toward $125,000 indicates measured move potential from a successful wedge breakout. Volume characteristics reveal a decline in participation as the pattern matures, followed by an increase in activity during breakout attempts. Current positioning near the upper wedge boundary suggests that Bitcoin is in the final stages of its pattern, with a breakout likely triggering significant momentum-based buying that will propel it toward new all-time highs above the previous $123,000 peak. The convergence creates natural coiling effects where volatility compresses before expanding dramatically upon resolution. Bitcoin Price Prediction: Whale Accumulation Divergence Signals Institutional Absorption Whale holdings analysis reveals fascinating divergence where large holder accumulation accelerates despite high-profile Satoshi-era distributions.

While ancient whales distribute holdings, new institutional investors aggressively accumulate Bitcoin at current levels. This accumulation pattern suggests sophisticated investors view current prices as attractive entry points rather than distribution levels. Recent institutional activity includes BlackRock acquiring 1,204 additional BTC and MicroStrategy adding 4,225 coins, reinforcing absorption capacity for continued whale distributions. The divergent behavior where retail sentiment remains uncertain while whale accumulation continues typically indicates smart money positioning for the next major advance. Notably, the continuous decline in Bitcoin dominance, from 65.95% to 61.25%, indicates healthy capital rotation, suggesting that Bitcoin can continue to advance while the total cryptocurrency market expands, driving broader sector strength. $BTC Dominance pic.twitter.com/lBNC6asPSv — Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) July 26, 2025 BTC Hyper: Final Opportunity for $HYPER Presale Before Q3 Launch The exit of the Satoshi-era whales and institutional absorption highlight Bitcoin’s evolution toward mainstream adoption.

2025-07-27 11:36:07+00:00,Users Are Unstaking Their ETH in Unusual Amounts on Ethereum – What Does This Mean and Why Is It Happening? Cathie Wood Weighs In,"There has been a surge in unstaking of staked assets on the Ethereum network, reaching record levels in recent days. According to ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, the 2% cryptocurrency transfer reward offered by Robinhood may be behind this sudden unstaking demand. Responding to questions within the community about the sudden surge in Ethereum unstaking demand, Wood stated, “Robinhood offers a 2% matching reward on cryptocurrency transfers. Therefore, venture capitalists and other investors are transferring their staked ETH, which has expired, to companies known as digital asset treasuries (DATs) to raise funds.” Wood added that these companies operate similarly to MicroStrategy (MSTR) and Bitmine (BMNR), with brokerage advisors offering their clients BTC and ETH investments through these types of shares. This massive unstaking drive by validators and long-term investors on the Ethereum network has surpassed the outflow wave caused by Celsius in January 2024. According to onchain data, approximately 693,000 ETH, or $2.6 billion worth of assets, are currently waiting to be withdrawn. This is the largest unstaking wave since the introduction of Ethereum''s staking mechanism.

Due to the high volume of withdrawal requests, the withdrawal queue has extended to 12 days. However, the amount of ETH waiting to be staked remains at only 296,000 ETH, indicating very low demand for re-staking. According to staking service provider Everstake, validators are unstaking not only for sales but also for strategies like restaking and yield optimization.

In a new interview on CNBC Television, Lee says that high-net-worth investors are still on the fence about speculative stocks, shares of firms that carry a high level of risk but also offer the potential for very high returns The performance of these stocks is often attributed to hope and hype rather than a proven business model. Says Lee, “These are not the stocks that we recommend for our clients. You know, we stick with large-cap quality and portfolios. 35 of the best S&P [500] names… There’s $7 trillion of cash on the sidelines, and retail investor sentiment, I think you have to really fracture it. I think the Robinhood community is bullish, but what I’d call the high-net-worth and the traditional equity investor is still pretty cautious. That’s the heart of our universe of clients.” Lee also says that the US stock market is still in good shape to witness more rallies, as investor sentiment appears to be muted despite surges to all-time high prices. “So I would say speculative activity, those are such small examples that I would say it’s way too early for me to say there’s speculation… High beta as an ETF (exchange-traded fund), if you look at that, it usually should lead in a bull market. So it’s not unusual… But the thing to keep in mind is that in 2021… people were speculative excess in these Mag 7 and these large-cap names.

After months of prolonged selling pressure and underperformance, ETH has staged a remarkable comeback, rallying over 175% since late April. This surge marks a turning point for the second-largest cryptocurrency, as it regains momentum and investor attention. Related Reading: $4B Increase In Bitcoin Open Interest Fueled By Whale Transfers To Exchanges – Details According to data from CryptoQuant, Ethereum Open Interest on CME Futures has now reached an all-time high—signaling heightened institutional activity and growing market engagement. This sharp increase in derivatives exposure often precedes further volatility, hinting that traders are positioning for larger moves ahead. While the overall trend remains bullish, with on-chain and derivatives data pointing toward continued strength, some analysts warn that the market may be approaching overbought conditions. Speculation is growing around a potential correction or spike in volatility as Ethereum approaches key psychological resistance zones. Still, with ETH reclaiming leadership over Bitcoin in recent weeks and altcoins beginning to move in tandem, many view this renewed momentum as the start of a broader altcoin cycle. Ethereum Leads The Way Ethereum is gaining significant momentum, both technically and fundamentally. According to crypto analyst Maartunn, ETH Open Interest on CME Futures has reached an all-time high of $7.85 billion. This spike in interest coincides with a pivotal moment for crypto regulation in the US. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act by Congress marks a turning point in legal clarity for digital assets. These legislative wins create a friendlier environment for Ethereum-based applications, particularly in DeFi, where many protocols had previously operated in legal uncertainty. With a more defined regulatory path, Ethereum stands to benefit as developers and capital increasingly move onshore. At the same time, Ethereum has shown notable strength against Bitcoin. ETH/BTC has been trending higher over the past few weeks, reinforcing the perception that ETH could lead the next leg of the market cycle. This shift is important—especially as investors rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Accumulate Over $4.1B In ETH In Two Weeks – Details Price Action Details Ethereum continues its bullish trend, currently trading near $3,753 after a breakout rally that began in late April. The 3-day chart reveals a significant price expansion above the key resistance level at $2,852, now acting as support. ETH is consolidating just below the $3,860 resistance, which marks the final barrier before the psychological $4,000 level—last tested in late 2021 and again in late 2023. All major moving averages—the 50, 100, and 200—are now trending upward and stacked in a bullish configuration. Price action is well above these levels, indicating strong market momentum.

2025-07-27 12:30:41+00:00,The 4-Year Cycle Is Dead: Matt Hougan Breaks Down The New Crypto Era,"This year, the crypto market has entered uncharted territory. New structural dynamics are reshaping how investors view the space, calling into question the long-held belief in the classic four-year cycle. Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events and market boom-bust patterns have followed a predictable rhythm—but 2025 is breaking that mold. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the industry has entered a new era. In a recent analysis, he argued that the traditional four-year cycle is no longer a reliable framework for understanding crypto market behavior. According to Hougan, the two key drivers behind this shift are the weakening of the forces that created earlier cycles—such as the diminishing impact of halvings and blow-up risk—and second, the emergence of larger, longer-term trends that don’t align with the old pattern. From the rise of crypto ETFs to a surge in institutional adoption and regulatory progress, Hougan sees multi-year forces beginning to dominate market direction. As Wall Street capital begins flowing into digital assets, and regulatory clarity grows with legislation like the GENIUS Act, investors may need to recalibrate their expectations. Long-Term Forces Reshaping Crypto’s Market Structure According to Hougan, each halving becomes “half as important” every four years, reducing its impact on market momentum. Unlike 2018 and 2022, when the interest rate environment added pressure to risk assets, today’s monetary backdrop is more favorable to crypto. Additionally, blow-up risks from unregulated players are fading as regulation improves and institutionalization advances. Hougan notes that the rise of regulated entities and better transparency has stabilized the market and removed some of the cyclical fragility. He also points to a more significant, emerging risk: the growing influence of Treasury companies that hold and move large amounts of crypto. Their potential to influence markets on a short-term basis is substantial and worth monitoring. At the same time, larger forces are now in motion. The shift of capital into crypto ETFs marks the beginning of a 5–10 year trend that started in 2024. Institutional adoption is only just beginning, with pensions and endowments starting to explore the asset class. Regulatory momentum kicked off in January 2025, and Wall Street capital is only beginning to flow following the passage of the Genius Act this month. “These long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic ‘four-year cycle’ forces,” Hougan said. He believes 2026 will be a strong year—not because of another hype-driven surge, but because of what he calls a “sustained steady boom” rather than a super-cycle. While acknowledging that volatility will persist, Hougan emphasizes that crypto’s maturation is real and accelerating. Investors may need to recalibrate their strategies for this new era. Crypto Long-Term Trend Strengthens The monthly logarithmic chart of the total crypto market cap reveals a clear long-term uptrend, currently sitting around $3.82 trillion. After a prolonged consolidation phase that began in mid-2022, the market has steadily climbed and is now approaching its all-time high range near the $3.9 trillion–$4 trillion mark. This level acted as a significant resistance zone during the previous cycle and remains a key psychological barrier. From a technical perspective, the 50-month simple moving average (SMA) continues to slope upward and currently sits at $1.88 trillion, well below the current market value, reflecting strong macro support. Additionally, volume has picked up significantly in recent months—especially during the last two green candles—indicating renewed investor confidence and institutional inflows, consistent with the narrative of growing ETF adoption and broader regulatory clarity. The market structure also shows higher lows and higher highs on the monthly timeframe, signaling that the bullish trend remains intact. As long as the crypto market cap continues to hold above $3.2 trillion and makes another monthly close above $3.8 trillion, the probability of a breakout toward uncharted territory increases significantly.

This year, the crypto market has entered uncharted territory. New structural dynamics are reshaping how investors view the space, calling into question the long-held belief in the classic four-year cycle. Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events and market boom-bust patterns have followed a predictable rhythm—but 2025 is breaking that mold. Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise Asset Management, believes the industry has entered a new era. In a recent analysis, he argued that the traditional four-year cycle is no longer a reliable framework for understanding crypto market behavior. According to Hougan, the two key drivers behind this shift are the weakening of the forces that created earlier cycles—such as the diminishing impact of halvings and blow-up risk—and second, the emergence of larger, longer-term trends that don’t align with the old pattern. From the rise of crypto ETFs to a surge in institutional adoption and regulatory progress, Hougan sees multi-year forces beginning to dominate market direction. As Wall Street capital begins flowing into digital assets, and regulatory clarity grows with legislation like the GENIUS Act, investors may need to recalibrate their expectations. Long-Term Forces Reshaping Crypto’s Market Structure According to Hougan, each halving becomes “half as important” every four years, reducing its impact on market momentum. Unlike 2018 and 2022, when the interest rate environment added pressure to risk assets, today’s monetary backdrop is more favorable to crypto. Additionally, blow-up risks from unregulated players are fading as regulation improves and institutionalization advances. Hougan notes that the rise of regulated entities and better transparency has stabilized the market and removed some of the cyclical fragility. He also points to a more significant, emerging risk: the growing influence of Treasury companies that hold and move large amounts of crypto. Their potential to influence markets on a short-term basis is substantial and worth monitoring. At the same time, larger forces are now in motion. The shift of capital into crypto ETFs marks the beginning of a 5–10 year trend that started in 2024.

The official complaint, which was filed by the man on July 26, claimed that digital assets worth €381,653 were stolen from his wallet. The complaint filed at the cybercrime division of the Cyprus police noted that the incident happened on June 11. The man claimed that unknown criminals gained unauthorized entry into his wallet, stealing his digital assets in the process. The hackers exploited a key weakness, gaining the password to the breached wallet from his email account, which had also been hacked in the past. Once they gained access to the digital assets , they moved all of them to a different digital asset. Cyprus police kickstart investigations into crypto theft Cyprus police have mentioned that the investigation will be very hard, and recovering the digital assets might be extremely difficult. The police say this case highlights a growing concern that has rocked Cyprus and the global crypto community. There has been a rise in cyberattacks targeting personal digital assets. These criminals target victims under the guise of either offering help or selling a service. Analysts have also noted that while digital assets offer privacy and decentralization, they also carry risks without proper security. For instance, users are being advised to write down their passwords and seed phrases offline. This way, they are safe, even when their devices are hacked. In response to the incident, the Cyprus police have issued a public advisory to individuals dealing in digital assets, urging them to take steps to secure their digital properties. Authorities have also recommended the use of secure digital wallets with advanced safety measures to help combat this menace. In addition, traders and enthusiasts are urged to only carry out transactions on trusted platforms, drumming up the need for two-factor authentication as a requirement to carry out transactions on platforms. The public has also been warned not to open suspicious links or download untrustworthy applications. Some of these scammers create applications and websites to mirror the original platforms.

2025-07-27 13:21:59+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Reclaims $118,000 Despite Recent Volatility","Bitcoin (BTC) has nudged past $118,000 during the ongoing session despite recent volatility that saw the price drop to an intraday low of $114,770 on Friday. However, it recovered over the weekend, steadily climbing as price action remained muted. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $118,115. OG Bitcoin Holders “Faith Shaken” A crypto analyst has sparked a debate in the Bitcoin and crypto communities, claiming Bitcoin OGs are losing faith in the asset as it sees increasing institutional adoption. Scott Melker, also known as the Wolf of All Street, stated in a post on X, “Many of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices. Bitcoin is amazing, but it’s obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against.” Melker pointed out that he is only highlighting what he has been hearing. However, the comments triggered a wave of reactions from the Bitcoin community regarding the asset’s institutional adoption and its implications for its original ethos. Alpine Fox founder and managing partner Mike Alfred disagreed with Melker, stating, “People make a personal decision to sell some or all of their coins for a myriad of reasons that have nothing to do with the asset or protocol. Everyone dies. At some point, investment returns become irrelevant.” One early adopter revealed that he sold his Bitcoin because he believes investing in Bitcoin infrastructure would give better returns. Bitcoiner Dave Weisberger stated that widespread Bitcoin adoption is impossible without institutional interest. “The irony is that there is NO path to a Bitcoin standard without adoption by the public through the legacy institutions controlling the fiat system AND the distribution of OG held Bitcoin to those entities.” Bitcoin Could See Significant Upside In 2026 Bitcoin (BTC) could see substantial upside in 2026, potentially marking the end of its four-year market cycle, according to Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. The prediction comes amid sharp disagreements among analysts about whether Bitcoin will change its historical pattern or follow the traditional halving cycle. Hougan stated, “I bet 2026 is an up year. I broadly think we’re in for a good few years.” Hougan added that Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle is “dead” due to several reasons, including the Bitcoin halving becoming “half as important” every four years. President Donald Trump has also been pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency. He also noted that the chances of a significant pullback have decreased due to increased regulatory clarity. “Blow-up risk is attenuated, due to improving regulation and the institutionalization of the space. The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic ""four-year cycle"" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year.” Hougan stated that the most significant “cyclical-style risk” for Bitcoin is the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has traded in positive territory over the weekend, posting marginal gains as it briefly crossed $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has faced substantial selling pressure in recent sessions. BTC has struggled to reclaim $120,000 but has held above $115,000, indicating that buyers have not ceded ground. Analysts believe BTC’s bullish structure remains intact, but price action will likely be steady rather than aggressive jumps. “I think it’s more sustained, steady boom than super-cycle. I could be wrong, and I''m certain there will be significant volatility.” The forecast comes days after CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju said that he believes the Bitcoin four-year cycle is dead. Ju stated, “My predictions were based on it — buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales were sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we thought.” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday after facing substantial volatility and selling pressure. As a result, it fell to a low of $116,805 before settling at $117,877, ultimately registering a 1.03% decrease. Sellers retained control over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop on Saturday before falling 0.48% on Sunday to settle at $117,240, but not before dropping to a low of $116,240. BTC started the week in positive territory, reaching an intraday high of $119,603. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,402, registering a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,982.

Bitcoin (BTC) has nudged past $118,000 during the ongoing session despite recent volatility that saw the price drop to an intraday low of $114,770 on Friday. However, it recovered over the weekend, steadily climbing as price action remained muted. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $118,115. OG Bitcoin Holders “Faith Shaken” A crypto analyst has sparked a debate in the Bitcoin and crypto communities, claiming Bitcoin OGs are losing faith in the asset as it sees increasing institutional adoption. Scott Melker, also known as the Wolf of All Street, stated in a post on X, “Many of the most ardent early whales have seen their faith shaken and have been selling at these prices. Bitcoin is amazing, but it’s obviously been co-opted to some degree by the very people that it was created as a hedge against.” Melker pointed out that he is only highlighting what he has been hearing. However, the comments triggered a wave of reactions from the Bitcoin community regarding the asset’s institutional adoption and its implications for its original ethos. Alpine Fox founder and managing partner Mike Alfred disagreed with Melker, stating, “People make a personal decision to sell some or all of their coins for a myriad of reasons that have nothing to do with the asset or protocol. Everyone dies. At some point, investment returns become irrelevant.” One early adopter revealed that he sold his Bitcoin because he believes investing in Bitcoin infrastructure would give better returns. Bitcoiner Dave Weisberger stated that widespread Bitcoin adoption is impossible without institutional interest. “The irony is that there is NO path to a Bitcoin standard without adoption by the public through the legacy institutions controlling the fiat system AND the distribution of OG held Bitcoin to those entities.” Bitcoin Could See Significant Upside In 2026 Bitcoin (BTC) could see substantial upside in 2026, potentially marking the end of its four-year market cycle, according to Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan. The prediction comes amid sharp disagreements among analysts about whether Bitcoin will change its historical pattern or follow the traditional halving cycle. Hougan stated, “I bet 2026 is an up year. I broadly think we’re in for a good few years.” Hougan added that Bitcoin’s four-year halving cycle is “dead” due to several reasons, including the Bitcoin halving becoming “half as important” every four years. President Donald Trump has also been pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency. He also noted that the chances of a significant pullback have decreased due to increased regulatory clarity. “Blow-up risk is attenuated, due to improving regulation and the institutionalization of the space. The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic ""four-year cycle"" forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year.” Hougan stated that the most significant “cyclical-style risk” for Bitcoin is the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies.

Community Financial Services Bank, Mechanics Bank and RABO AgriFinance are accused of knowingly or negligently enabling a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Kentucky farmer and businessman Brian McClain, reports WPSD Local 6. McClain is accused of stealing millions of dollars from investors in Graves County by masterminding a fictitious cattle investment scheme. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Mark Bryant, says McClain promised high guaranteed returns on a cattle business, with investors losing an enormous amount of money. “In reality, the complaint states, the promised cattle never existed, and the returns that were paid were paid using new investor funds in classic Ponzi fashion.” The lawsuit alleges that lax oversight and fraudulent transfers by the three banks helped sustain McClain’s Ponzi scheme for years. The three banks “allegedly turned a blind eye to hundreds of millions of dollars in irregular and suspicious transactions” initiated by McClain and his supposed cattle business. RABO AgriFinance reportedly gave McClain over $70 million in credit even though the lender had concerns over the businessman’s actual cattle ownership and poor keeping of records. Community Financial Services Bank reportedly allowed McClain to obtain more than 100 days of overdraft period and failed to act despite evidence of suspicious fund transfers. The bank was also aware of McClain’s financial position prior to the alleged Ponzi scheme but took no action even after the state of his finances changed drastically, according to the report. Mechanics Bank also allegedly allowed McClain overdrafts. McClain committed suicide in April of 2023 and the alleged Ponzi scheme was uncovered soon after his death. The class action lawsuit against the three banks is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

2025-07-27 13:59:44+00:00,Canadian elementary school drags crypto miner to court over noise that ''never stops'',"Canadian elementary school, Lake Superior Academy, has taken legal action against a cryptocurrency mining center, citing noise concerns. According to reports, the noise from the mining operation located at Mackinac Trail, seven miles south of Sault Ste. Marie is a high-pitched, metallic noise that sounds like a chorus of mechanical insects. According to the Canadian elementary school’s Superintendent Susie Schlehuber, the noise initially registered at 75 decibels, roughly the volume of a running vacuum cleaner, at the edge of the school’s property on the other side of the road earlier this year. She mentioned that at the school’s front door, it was about 65 decibels, the same as a washing machine. However, the annoying high-pitched metallic whine began in March. Canadian elementary school initiates legal action against crypto miner According to the lawsuit filed by the school, the noise was somewhat dampened by the addition of hay bales to the site, and aside from a court order to pause the operations for two weeks, the noise hasn’t stopped. “It’s 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It never stops,” said Schlehuber . She added that she founded the school because of an environmental focus, meaning that students always spend time outside their classrooms. Schlehuber added that the noise was noticeable because of that practice. “Because of that, we noticed the noise even more so than if we were just a school that stayed inside the classroom with the doors closed,” she said. The superintendent claims they had to stop conducting lessons on the front lawn, stop opening the windows, and halt plans to build two new classrooms. The crypto mining operation in question is a six self-contained bank of machines owned by a Boca Raton, Florida, company called Odessa Partners LLC. According to filings from the company’s attorneys, the company is made up of two other business entities, Wyoming Partners Irrevocably Statutory Trust, which is registered at an address in Cheyenne, and Valletta Corp, LLC, which is registered in Delaware. Both of these firms are linked to a Florida native named Michael Carbonara. Carbonara is the CEO of Ibanera, a company that provides a fintech enablement and cross-border payments network, according to its website. Carbonara also applied for the building permit for the mining operation. Carbonara and Odessa Partners are yet to respond to the lawsuit. The last time both entities made any form of communication was after Chippewa Country Circuit Judge James Lambros ordered the operation to stop temporarily last month. Odessa Partners submitted a legal finding claiming its losses per day were about $15,000, and it was already taking steps to reduce the noise, noting the placement of hay bales in front of the machines. The motion also noted that the school property is located alongside Interstate 75, arguing that “the noise Plaintiff claims to be emanating from Defendant’s property is purportedly less than that typically generated by the use and activity occurring on the other side of Plaintiff’s property.” However, Schlehuber countered the claim, saying, “There’s a huge difference between a loud truck going by a few times a day and constant noise.” She also claimed she had been trying to work with Odessa Partners regarding the issue since March and hadn’t seen any progress towards a solution. “We knew we had to do something else besides just talk to them,” she said. According to the CEO of OOM Technologies, which operates a computer hosting facility not too far from where Odessa Partners’ operation is located, that location is suitable for miners due to the abundance of resources. Shaw also added that the cold is part of the reasons, noting that “the most efficient way to cool the stuff is through the natural airflow.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-27 14:00:13+00:00,"Could BlockDAG Be the Next Big Crypto Coin? $353M Raised, $1 Outlook, and Millions Using the App","BlockDAG is moving up fast, supported by clear progress in technology and real use. Its structure mixes Proof-of-Work with parallel blocks that already process 10 blocks every second, built to scale with higher traffic. The ecosystem is also growing. More than 4,500 developers are working on hundreds of real-world applications, and over 2 million people are mining BDAG directly on their phones through the X1 mobile app. This progress has made BlockDAG ’s presale one of the largest seen in crypto recently. With over $353 million raised and the coin still available at a limited-time rate of $0.0016, many now see this as more than early access. With forecasts suggesting a possible $1 price, some are calling it the next big crypto coin. What Makes BlockDAG’s Tech Stand Out in the Market BlockDAG solves key problems that slow down older blockchains. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which build one block at a time, BlockDAG forms multiple blocks together. This design gives the system speed and flexibility that older models lack. The tech uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) format with Proof-of-Work security, allowing more data to move through the network without losing stability. Right now, it processes 10 blocks per second, and updates could take that beyond 100. This supports faster transactions, better app performance, and helps the system manage higher demand. The numbers show clear support. A presale raising $353 million suggests the idea is gaining ground. Developers and early users are not just testing the system—they’re building with it. Its low-energy mining model is another draw, especially for projects that care about efficiency and sustainability. With speed, traction, and support coming together, BlockDAG is in a strong position to be the next big crypto coin. How BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Is Already Gaining Real Use BlockDAG is not waiting around to build momentum. It already has more than 4,500 developers working on over 300 practical projects. These include tools for DeFi, AI platforms, and other apps people can use in daily life. This level of developer activity adds real purpose to BDAG. The coin isn’t just sitting unused. It’s being added to tools, tested, and applied, showing clear signs of actual demand. That kind of growth supports the idea that BDAG could be the next big crypto coin. User participation adds another layer. The X1 Miner App now has more than 2 million active users. Mining can be done by simply downloading the app and tapping a button. No extra equipment or extra costs. Anyone with a phone can take part. With the release of the X10 miner, users can now link it to the X1 app and raise their daily mining rate from 20 to 200 BDAG coins. This feature was shown during a live demo led by BlockDAG’s CEO and CMO. It allows users to mine from home with little setup. This easy access and growing activity have helped bring in more than 200,000 unique BDAG holders. Combined with the strong developer community, this adoption puts BlockDAG in a solid position for what comes next. Could BlockDAG Reach $1? Analysts Are Taking Notice BlockDAG’s presale has quickly become a major topic across the crypto space this year. Since the start of its first batch, BDAG has gone up by 2,660%, rising from $0.001 to $0.0276 in batch 29. Even with this sharp increase, a limited-time price of $0.0016 is still being offered. This rare pricing move is drawing major attention ahead of launch. So far, the project has raised over $353 million and sold more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins, moving closer to a $600 million goal. The momentum is now building toward BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. Its launch price has already been set at $0.05, meaning those who access it at $0.0016 could see a 3,025% return on day one. Some forecasts are even predicting higher targets, from $1 to as much as $10 in the future. With this kind of traction before going live, BDAG is showing traits that match what many call the next big crypto coin. Final Say BlockDAG is showing progress in all key areas: scale-ready tech, working utility, active builder support, and a presale setting new records. While many platforms try to grow after launch, BlockDAG is building momentum before it reaches public markets. This early activity, paired with its solid structure, suggests it is more than a short-lived trend. It could become a lasting part of the crypto landscape. With the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaching and the $0.0016 pricing window closing soon, this phase may not last much longer. If current signals continue, BlockDAG could turn out to be the next big crypto coin that people talk about for years to come.

With speed, traction, and support coming together, BlockDAG is in a strong position to be the next big crypto coin. How BlockDAG’s Ecosystem Is Already Gaining Real Use BlockDAG is not waiting around to build momentum. It already has more than 4,500 developers working on over 300 practical projects. These include tools for DeFi, AI platforms, and other apps people can use in daily life. This level of developer activity adds real purpose to BDAG. The coin isn’t just sitting unused. It’s being added to tools, tested, and applied, showing clear signs of actual demand. That kind of growth supports the idea that BDAG could be the next big crypto coin. User participation adds another layer. The X1 Miner App now has more than 2 million active users. Mining can be done by simply downloading the app and tapping a button. No extra equipment or extra costs. Anyone with a phone can take part. With the release of the X10 miner, users can now link it to the X1 app and raise their daily mining rate from 20 to 200 BDAG coins. This feature was shown during a live demo led by BlockDAG’s CEO and CMO. It allows users to mine from home with little setup. This easy access and growing activity have helped bring in more than 200,000 unique BDAG holders. Combined with the strong developer community, this adoption puts BlockDAG in a solid position for what comes next. Could BlockDAG Reach $1? Analysts Are Taking Notice BlockDAG’s presale has quickly become a major topic across the crypto space this year. Since the start of its first batch, BDAG has gone up by 2,660%, rising from $0.001 to $0.0276 in batch 29. Even with this sharp increase, a limited-time price of $0.0016 is still being offered. This rare pricing move is drawing major attention ahead of launch. So far, the project has raised over $353 million and sold more than 24.3 billion BDAG coins, moving closer to a $600 million goal. The momentum is now building toward BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. Its launch price has already been set at $0.05, meaning those who access it at $0.0016 could see a 3,025% return on day one. Some forecasts are even predicting higher targets, from $1 to as much as $10 in the future. With this kind of traction before going live, BDAG is showing traits that match what many call the next big crypto coin. Final Say BlockDAG is showing progress in all key areas: scale-ready tech, working utility, active builder support, and a presale setting new records. While many platforms try to grow after launch, BlockDAG is building momentum before it reaches public markets. This early activity, paired with its solid structure, suggests it is more than a short-lived trend. It could become a lasting part of the crypto landscape. With the August 11 GLOBAL LAUNCH release approaching and the $0.0016 pricing window closing soon, this phase may not last much longer. If current signals continue, BlockDAG could turn out to be the next big crypto coin that people talk about for years to come.

He believes this shift will help Bitcoin behave more like a real currency and not just a roller‑coaster asset. Institutional Steady Hands Based on reports from Citigroup, every $1 billion of ETF inflows can lift Bitcoin by about 3.6%. Using that math, Citi sees Bitcoin hitting $199,000 before December 31. That forecast depends on steady money flowing in. Big funds make big bets. And those bets tend to stick around longer than retail traders chasing quick gains. Citigroup notes that BlackRock’s IBIT became the fastest ETF to reach $100 billion. That matters because it shows how hungry big players are for crypto. If those trends keep up, Bitcoin could push past its current trading band. It may even test new highs without the classic “God candle” leaps that gave quick fortunes—and quick losses. Volatility Trade‑Offs Meanwhile, some analysts warn that early Bitcoin whales are taking profits and stepping aside. As institutions arrive, some old‑school traders will leave.

He admitted on X that during his stint at a firm called WebMaster, technical glitches and a lack of interest in the full band forced him to improvise. Fans only wanted Ozzy. So Schwartz “cheated,” feeding prewritten questions and edited answers through the company’s old ConferenceRoom software. Early Online Q&A Shows Schwartz said that moderators were supposed to relay fan queries by phone and then transcribe the band’s replies. But when no one asked about Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler or Bill Ward, he slipped in “canned” questions to each member in turn.

At one point, Schwartz mixed what he could hear with answers provided by the band’s manager. He later confessed feeling bad that the session wasn’t the real, unfiltered chat he had hoped to run. Censoring Ozzy’s Replies Poor audio meant much of Ozzy’s legendary profanity was barely audible. Schwartz typed out the “C‑word” many times over, but then scrubbed it at the request of his bosses. He said the bad C‑word was pretty close to the only word he could hear clearly, so he censored it to make the conversation fit a family‑friendly format. The episode left him disillusioned about how hard it was to pull off an authentic live event online. Fan Tribute And Crypto Surge Based on reports, the confession arrived just days after Osbourne died on July 22, 2025, at age 76. As fans shared memories, developers launched meme coins in his honor. One token, The Mad Man (OZZY), rocketed more than 16,000% to trade at $0.0039, briefly topping a $3.80 million market cap before investors began to worry about scams and sudden dumps. Ripple And SEC Settlement Meanwhile, Ripple has been making headlines of its own. Last month, CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the company would pull its cross‑appeal against the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC is also expected to drop its appeal.

2025-07-27 14:05:41+00:00,Analyst predicts Bitcoin price for Q4,"A historical price comparison between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and gold suggests that the cryptocurrency could rally by 35% in the fourth quarter. Notably, analysis by Ted Pillows projects a major upward move for Bitcoin, suggesting the digital asset could mirror gold’s historical breakout pattern. If the analogy holds, BTC may trade above $160,000 by Q4, he said in an X post on July 26. The comparison draws on analysis of gold and Bitcoin’s market behavior, identifying phases of accumulation, distribution, and re-accumulation before each asset entered a strong rally. Gold and Bitcoin price analysis. Source: Ted Pillows Notably, gold’s rally, from under $2,000 to over $3,300, followed a prolonged re-accumulation phase. According to Pillows, Bitcoin appears to be nearing the end of a similar structure. The analyst suggested Bitcoin’s market cycle is currently transitioning from re-accumulation to a rally phase. This final leg could significantly push the cryptocurrency’s price higher, potentially exceeding $160,000 before year-end. It’s worth noting that in 2025, gold has delivered a standout performance as investors turned to the precious metal for its safe-haven appeal amid growing concerns over a potential economic downturn. There is indeed potential for Bitcoin to reach these levels, especially as some analysts argue that holding key technical indicators will be crucial to its success. For instance, as reported by Finbold, crypto trading expert Ali Martinez noted that as long as Bitcoin holds above the $110,000 spot level, there is room to reach a new all-time high at $130,000. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was valued at $118,216, posting modest gains of less than 0.1% in the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, however, BTC is down 0.45%.

2025-07-27 14:30:12+00:00,Wells Fargo Warns Fed Rate Cut and Additional Catalysts Could Trigger Pullback for Group of Assets – Here’s the Bank’s Outlook,"Banking titan Wells Fargo is unveiling a scenario that could trigger a correction for artificial intelligence (AI)-focused stocks. In a new CNBC interview, Chris Harvey, the head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities, says investors are skeptical about the sustainability of stock market rallies after equities rebounded in a massive way from the April lows. Rather than a pullback, Harvey expects the stock market to consolidate as he sees the Fed cutting rates in the coming months. “A lot of people are looking for a pullback. They are talking about things being overextended. They’re talking about uncertainty with the Fed, and earnings and lions, tigers and bears, oh no. I don’t know what the short term holds. I think we could see a consolidation. It’s really unclear for me, but the underlying fundamentals: still strong. We do think the Fed will certainly have to be dovish in the next couple of months, and what we also think is that rates are going to rally because the deficit, in all likelihood, while not going to be good, will probably be better than expected based on some of the tariff news that we’re getting.” Looking at the tech sector, Harvey warns that a string of good news could hurt the AI trade. He notes that a more favorable macroeconomic landscape could stimulate risk-taking behavior and encourage investors in AI stocks to seek higher gains in other sectors. “One thing I think that could potentially hurt the AI trade is if you do get the Fed cutting, if growth is better than expected, if rates do come down, suddenly the contrarian trade starts to look better, and you could see rotation. And I think that’s the biggest fear for AI right now.” Popular AI names include Nvidia, AMD, Palantir, Microsoft, Meta and Google.

2025-07-27 15:30:13+00:00,Bitcoin Bulls Gain Traction From Ideal Long Zone: 2 Scenarios For The Week Ahead,"The Bitcoin market recorded a minor 0.67% price gain in the last 24 hours, amid a brief return to the $118,000 price territory. This modest price increase forms part of a rebound observed over the previous 48 hours, following a significant 4% price correction earlier last week. Looking ahead to the new week, renowned market analyst with X username KillaXBT has identified two potential price development scenarios for the premier cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Holds Above $115,000 — Here’s Why This Level Is Significant Bitcoin Sees Bounce From Key Demand Zone, But What’s Next? In an X post on July 26, KillaXBT provides an in-depth technical analysis of the Bitcoin market to map out the asset’s potential price trajectory in this new week. The popular market expert duly notes that Bitcoin experienced a price bounce after dipping into a key demand zone around $115,000, which they also described as an ideal long entry region. As earlier stated, the crypto market leader has since climbed to $118,000 following this price rebound. However, KillaXBT notes there is an established CME Gap around $117,071, which is likely to serve as a price magnet in the short term. For context, CME gaps are price gaps on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Bitcoin futures chart that occur when Bitcoin’s price moves significantly on the spot market when CME markets are closed, typically over the weekend. In view of next week, KillaXBT explains scenario 1 in which the Bitcoin market opens on a bullish note. In this case, the analyst states investors should expect Bitcoin to eventually form a higher low, ideally through a sweep of liquidity around the $116,000 area. However, if Bitcoin bulls can effectively hold this price pocket, it would trigger fresh long setups with stop losses tucked below the prior week’s low. In scenario 2, KillaXBT paints a more aggressive situation in which Bitcoin performs a double sweep of last week’s wick low around $114,800, thereby effecting a ruthless liquidity grab before an upward reversal. However, the market expert favours the reality of scenario 1, following the earlier liquidity grab with the price dip to $115,000. Related Reading: XRP Produces Successful $3 Support Retest – But What Next?

In particular, the analyst explains that failure for the price to hold above the recent wick lows following a retest would force Bitcoin prices to deeper imbalance zones between $112,000 – $113,800.

In a press release, the Department of Justice says Santiago Garcia Gutierrez is guilty of wire fraud, impersonating a federal officer, aggravated identity theft and making a false statement after orchestrating two separate fraudulent investment schemes. Authorities say that between 2018 and 2020, Gutierrez siphoned more than $2.8 million from a victim by pretending that he was working as a confidential informant for the Department of Homeland Security. Gutierrez fraudulently claimed that he could use his position to get discounts on exotic cars, planes and vessels that were seized by the US government. He duped the victim into using him as a middleman for purchasing what turned out to be nonexistent luxury assets. To make the scheme look legitimate, he sent the victim text messages from different phone numbers and made it appear that messages were from a confidential government informant, federal agent and even his own attorney. Gutierrez also defrauded eight other victims between 2019 and 2024. He persuaded them to invest in federal oil wells he had an ownership interest in, with promises of large returns. The victims did not receive any profit as Gutierrez used the money for his personal benefit, causing investor losses of more than $900,000. Gutierrez did not pay the federal government royalties on the sale of the oil extracted from the wells, despite knowing that he had to do so. On top of prison time, Gutierrez was ordered to pay $3.7 million in restitution to the victims and to forfeit $2.85 million.

2025-07-27 15:33:00+00:00,"Bitwise CIO Bets on Bitcoin Rally in 2026, Defying 4-Year Cycle","Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan believes Bitcoin could break from its historical four-year cycle and post significant gains in 2026 — a call that diverges from mainstream expectations of a cycle peak later this year. Key Takeaways: Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts Bitcoin could see major gains in 2026, breaking from its historic four-year cycle. He cites reduced halving impact, improving regulation, and institutional adoption as drivers of long-term momentum. Hougan warns that Bitcoin treasury firms could pose risks if overleveraged during market downturns. “I bet 2026 is an up year,” Hougan said in a video shared on X , adding, “I broadly think we’re in for a good few years.” His remarks come as debate intensifies over whether the classic Bitcoin halving-driven model still holds. Hougan Says Bitcoin Halving Cycle Losing Its Influence According to Hougan, several factors are now overriding the influence of the halving cycle. He argued the impact of halvings weakens over time, as each one cuts rewards by a smaller absolute amount. He also pointed to the broader macro environment, where U.S. presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, a move that could drive capital away from bonds and toward risk assets like Bitcoin. “Blow-up risk is attenuated, due to improving regulation and the institutionalization of the space,” Hougan said, noting that clearer rules and expanding institutional involvement have reduced the likelihood of market shocks. He added that ongoing adoption by traditional firms could extend Bitcoin’s bullish momentum well beyond historical timelines. However, Hougan also flagged risks. He pointed to the rise of Bitcoin treasury companies — firms that buy BTC using debt or equity issuance — as a potential vulnerability. DID I HEAR SUPER CYCLE??? The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it. @Matt_Hougan says we''re going higher in 2026. Early profit takers will be left behind!!! Full break down with @JSeyff and @Matt_Hougan in comments pic.twitter.com/Ffn9penapN — Kyle Chassé / DD (@kyle_chasse) July 25, 2025 Asset manager VanEck has echoed similar concerns, warning that such companies could be overleveraged if the market turns. Despite those caveats, Hougan expects a more measured advance ahead. “I think it’s more ‘sustained steady boom’ than super-cycle,” he said, though he acknowledged the path forward will still include volatility. Bitcoin is currently trading around $118,169, having climbed over 10% in the past month, according to Nansen. Hougan’s view aligns with recent commentary from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who declared the four-year cycle “dead,” citing a shift in whale behavior. “Old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we thought,” Ju noted. Bitcoin Could Peak in October If 2020 Cycle Repeats, Says Analyst However, not everyone agrees. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently warned that if Bitcoin mirrors its 2020 cycle, the market could peak in October, 550 days after the April 2024 halving. That would keep Bitcoin firmly within its historic rhythm, suggesting the debate over its future trajectory is far from settled. Bitcoin’s strong performance and growing reputation as a store of value have led analyst Tom Lee to call it “Digital Gold,” with a bold long-term price forecast of $1 million. Speaking on CNBC, Lee emphasized Bitcoin’s role as an emerging asset class that could challenge gold’s dominance. He also pointed to recent regulatory progress, such as the approval of the GENIUS Act, as a positive sign for the crypto sector. Lee believes a $200K–$250K Bitcoin price is achievable, representing just a fraction of gold’s market value.

2025-07-27 15:48:10+00:00,"BREAKING: Critical Moments in the US-China Trade War, According to Chinese Sources, Tariffs to Be Extended for Another 90 Days – Here Are the Details","The United States and China are expected to decide to extend the current tariff rates they have imposed on each other for another 90 days during trade talks that will begin on Monday in Stockholm, Sweden. According to sources close to the talks on both sides, the extension would be a continuation of the existing agreement reached in May and set to expire on August 12. The two countries mutually suspended most of their heavy tariffs in May, buying time for talks. In the third round of talks, the parties are expected to clarify their positions on key points of contention, particularly US concerns about China''s excess industrial capacity. However, sources say no concrete breakthroughs are expected from these talks. According to three sources close to the Chinese side, while the previous Geneva and London meetings were generally focused on “reducing tensions,” Beijing will also want to bring up the 20% additional tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by US President Donald Trump in March due to the fentanyl crisis in the Stockholm talks. The Trump administration has argued that China has not done enough to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US. However, Washington has not offered clear criteria for what constitutes “sufficient progress.” The Chinese delegation may seek further clarification on this matter. A source familiar with the matter said Beijing “does not find the 20% tariff fair” but might accept a basic 10% tariff if the additional tariff were removed. Related News: Michael Saylor Gives the Signal Again, May Announce Bitcoin Purchase Tomorrow - Here''s the Current Profit Amount and Average Purchase Price According to the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics, the average U.S. tariff on Chinese goods currently stands at 51.1%. While the Chinese side considers this excessive, they say they have already absorbed the 25% increase implemented during Trump''s first term. The People''s Daily, the Communist Party of China''s media outlet, wrote in an editorial on Sunday that Beijing was ready to cooperate with Washington to achieve “meaningful progress” in the Stockholm talks. The article stated that “China has always adopted a constructive stance and advocated resolving issues through equal dialogue,” and called for strengthening mutual trust and reducing misunderstandings. However, experts say no major outcomes should be expected from these talks. Niklas Swanstrom, director of the Stockholm-based Institute for Security and Development Policy, approached the talks cautiously, saying, “I don''t expect a rupture, but I''d be happy if I''m wrong.” Frederic Cho, vice president of the Sweden-China Business Council, also indicated that a 90-day extension would be the likely outcome of the talks. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business last week that he would work on this extension with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that issues such as ownership of the popular short-video app TikTok could also be indirectly discussed. If ByteDance doesn''t transfer control of TikTok to an American company, the app risks being banned in the US. According to Philippe Le Corre, head of the Asia Program at French business school ESSEC, the Stockholm talks could be a preparatory phase before a final agreement is reached.

The United States and China are expected to decide to extend the current tariff rates they have imposed on each other for another 90 days during trade talks that will begin on Monday in Stockholm, Sweden. According to sources close to the talks on both sides, the extension would be a continuation of the existing agreement reached in May and set to expire on August 12. The two countries mutually suspended most of their heavy tariffs in May, buying time for talks. In the third round of talks, the parties are expected to clarify their positions on key points of contention, particularly US concerns about China''s excess industrial capacity. However, sources say no concrete breakthroughs are expected from these talks. According to three sources close to the Chinese side, while the previous Geneva and London meetings were generally focused on “reducing tensions,” Beijing will also want to bring up the 20% additional tariffs imposed on Chinese goods by US President Donald Trump in March due to the fentanyl crisis in the Stockholm talks. The Trump administration has argued that China has not done enough to stop the flow of fentanyl into the US. However, Washington has not offered clear criteria for what constitutes “sufficient progress.” The Chinese delegation may seek further clarification on this matter. A source familiar with the matter said Beijing “does not find the 20% tariff fair” but might accept a basic 10% tariff if the additional tariff were removed.

While the Chinese side considers this excessive, they say they have already absorbed the 25% increase implemented during Trump''s first term. The People''s Daily, the Communist Party of China''s media outlet, wrote in an editorial on Sunday that Beijing was ready to cooperate with Washington to achieve “meaningful progress” in the Stockholm talks. The article stated that “China has always adopted a constructive stance and advocated resolving issues through equal dialogue,” and called for strengthening mutual trust and reducing misunderstandings. However, experts say no major outcomes should be expected from these talks. Niklas Swanstrom, director of the Stockholm-based Institute for Security and Development Policy, approached the talks cautiously, saying, “I don''t expect a rupture, but I''d be happy if I''m wrong.” Frederic Cho, vice president of the Sweden-China Business Council, also indicated that a 90-day extension would be the likely outcome of the talks. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business last week that he would work on this extension with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC that issues such as ownership of the popular short-video app TikTok could also be indirectly discussed. If ByteDance doesn''t transfer control of TikTok to an American company, the app risks being banned in the US. According to Philippe Le Corre, head of the Asia Program at French business school ESSEC, the Stockholm talks could be a preparatory phase before a final agreement is reached. He suggested that a potential final agreement could be reached during a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea in October. *This is not investment advice.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, once again captures headlines with a monumental price movement. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has not just crossed, but confidently risen above the significant $119,000 mark. Specifically, on the Binance USDT market, BTC is currently trading at an impressive $119,001. This recent Bitcoin price surge is more than just a number; it’s a testament to the evolving dynamics of the digital economy and sparks crucial conversations about its future trajectory. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Surge For many, witnessing Bitcoin breach such a high psychological and technical barrier is a thrilling development. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signifies strong buying pressure and renewed confidence among investors. While Bitcoin has seen its fair share of dramatic rallies and corrections, breaking into new price territories always garners significant attention. What does it mean when the world’s leading cryptocurrency achieves such a milestone? Market Confidence: A sustained move above key resistance levels often indicates growing investor confidence and a bullish sentiment prevailing in the market. Increased Liquidity: Higher prices typically attract more participants, leading to increased trading volume and liquidity, making it easier for large transactions to occur without significant price impact. Psychological Impact: Reaching new highs or breaking significant thresholds like $119,000 can create a “fear of missing out” (FOMO) among potential investors, further driving demand. This particular Bitcoin price surge highlights the asset’s resilience and its continued journey towards mainstream financial integration. It serves as a powerful reminder of Bitcoin’s unique position in the global financial landscape. What’s Fueling This Bitcoin Price Surge? Behind every significant market movement, there are underlying factors at play. The current Bitcoin price surge is likely a confluence of several powerful drivers, both fundamental and technical. Understanding these catalysts is key to comprehending the broader market narrative. Let’s explore some of the primary forces contributing to this impressive rally: Driver Explanation Institutional Adoption Increasing interest from large financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds adds significant capital and legitimacy to the crypto space. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs in various regions has opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure. Macroeconomic Factors Concerns over inflation, geopolitical instability, and devaluing fiat currencies often push investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is sometimes seen as “digital gold” or a hedge against traditional market uncertainties. Bitcoin Halving Event The quadrennial Bitcoin halving, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoins entering circulation, historically precedes significant bull runs. The reduced supply, coupled with steady or increasing demand, naturally creates upward price pressure. Technological Advancements & Network Growth Ongoing developments in Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as the Lightning Network for faster transactions or improved scalability solutions, enhance its utility and appeal. Growing network adoption also reinforces its value proposition. Retail Investor Interest While institutions play a large role, renewed interest from individual investors, often spurred by positive news and social media trends, can also provide significant momentum. Accessibility through user-friendly platforms continues to grow. Each of these elements contributes to a compelling narrative that supports the ongoing ascent of Bitcoin’s value. The interplay of these factors creates a robust environment for continued growth, setting the stage for future movements of the Bitcoin price surge . Navigating the Volatility: Opportunities and Challenges of a Bitcoin Price Surge While a significant Bitcoin price surge is undoubtedly exciting, it’s crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. The crypto market is known for its volatility, and understanding both the potential opportunities and inherent challenges is vital for making informed decisions. What are the opportunities this surge presents? Potential for Capital Appreciation: The most obvious benefit is the opportunity for significant returns on investment, especially for those who invested at lower price points. Portfolio Diversification: Bitcoin can act as a non-correlated asset to traditional financial markets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk.

2025-07-27 16:30:05+00:00,White House to Unveil National Crypto Stockpile This Wednesday: XRP Rumored to be on the List,"A recent post by crypto influencer Xaif has sparked intense speculation across the digital asset space. According to Xaif, the White House is set to unveil a national crypto stockpile report this Wednesday, and XRP is rumored to be featured alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). If confirmed, this could mark a defining moment in XRP’s evolution, from a widely traded asset to a strategic U.S. digital reserve. Strategic Reserve Origins In March 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order establishing two groundbreaking institutions: the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile. The move came just months after his return to the White House and is widely seen as a pivot in U.S. digital asset policy. Under this framework, BTC would be recognized as a national reserve asset, while the Digital Asset Stockpile would hold other cryptocurrencies seized through legal proceedings.

That deadline expires this Wednesday, July 30, and the upcoming release is expected to clarify the structure, purpose, and contents of the nation’s crypto holdings. XRP’s Potential Role in the National Stockpile In March, President Trump hinted on Truth Social that XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) might be included in the government’s crypto stockpile. BTC and ETH were later added to the rumored list. These early disclosures sent shockwaves through the market, causing price rallies and fueling debates about which tokens the government might prioritize for long-term strategic use. If XRP is officially named in the report, it would represent a major milestone for the asset, especially given its long-standing regulatory battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Inclusion in a government-endorsed reserve would not only validate XRP’s legitimacy but also signal a shift in Washington’s stance toward the token.

2025-07-27 16:48:52+00:00,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Bull Market Will Last Another 14 Months, Unveils Short and Long-Term BTC Price Targets","A closely followed crypto strategist believes that the Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull market will endure another year or so based on historical precedent. Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 537,900 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin follows the business cycle, or the ebb and flow of macroeconomic activity, rather than the four-year halving cycle. According to the analyst, Bitcoin tends to rally hard when the business cycle begins a new uptrend, while the copper-to-gold ratio – a risk-appetite indicator –bottoms out.

A closely followed crypto strategist believes that the Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull market will endure another year or so based on historical precedent. Pseudonymous analyst TechDev tells his 537,900 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks Bitcoin follows the business cycle, or the ebb and flow of macroeconomic activity, rather than the four-year halving cycle.

2025-07-27 17:00:00+00:00,Michael Saylor Is Bringing Bitcoin-Backed Money-Market-Style Vehicle to Wall Street: NYDIG,"Strategy (MSTR) is pulling off some form of financial alchemy: using bitcoin, historically a volatile asset, to create something that looks a lot like stability. That’s the firm’s $2 billion “Stretch” Preferred Stock (STRC) offering offers a variable 9% dividend and is designed to keep the share price hovering near $100. The offering doesn’t give investors direct bitcoin exposure, yet it''s backed by the asset in spirit and structure, according to a recent NYDIG report. Strategy holds $71.7 billion in bitcoin and just $11 billion in liabilities, giving it room to deliver income even if crypto prices dip, the report notes. Historically, bitcoin has returned at least 3%–4% annually over any five-year stretch, while average returns have been significantly higher. Strategy is betting it can use this return profile to sustain high payouts without touching its crypto stash, essentially turning long-term bitcoin appreciation into monthly cash flow. “STRC looks to us like a high-yield, bitcoin-backed, money-market-style vehicle, designed to trade near $100 par while offering a far higher yield than traditional short-term instruments, albeit with a different liquidity profile,” NYDIG wrote. That premise has proven popular. Investor interest drove Strategy to quadruple the offering size from $500 million to $2 billion.

2025-07-27 17:00:22+00:00,Is It Time To Exchange Bitcoin For TRON? This Metric Says TRX Is About To Outperform BTC,"The price of Bitcoin has continued to impress investors in 2025 despite doubts after the top crypto hit a six-figure valuation at the tail end of 2024. As a result, the expectations of an altcoin season have seemed like a pipe dream so far this year. Nevertheless, that is not to say the altcoin market has not seen outstanding performers in 2025 — one of them being TRON (TRX). According to data from CoinGecko, the price of TRX is up by about 25% year-to-date. TRX In Underperformance Zone Relative To BTC On Saturday, July 26, Alphractal CEO & founder Joao Wedson took to the social media platform X to analyze the dynamics between Bitcoin and TRON, two of the largest assets in the crypto market. According to the on-chain expert, the TRX token might outpace the premier cryptocurrency in the coming months. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Sounds Alarm: If You’re An XRP Investor, You Should See This This interesting prediction is based on the TRX Opportunity Score metric, which tracks when the TRON token is outperforming or underperforming Bitcoin. Typically, this metric combines various indicators, including the TRX/BTC ratio, daily returns, volatility, Beta, and correlation. According to Wedson, the current TRX Opportunity Score suggests a potential turning point for the TRON price relative to the price of Bitcoin. The on-chain analyst revealed that the altcoin has once again entered a zone of underperformance relative to BTC — a phenomenon that has preceded strong reversals in the past. Wedson explained that every time TRON dropped into the red or orange zones on the chart (indicating weakness), it often began strong relative upward trends and went on to outperform Bitcoin. “This pattern has repeated across several past cycles — and it seems to be forming once again,” the on-chain expert added. With TRON seemingly bound to outpace Bitcoin in the coming weeks, Wedson suggested that investors might want to consider rotating some capital from BTC into TRX. “It may be strategically interesting to consider rotating a small portion of BTC into TRX, aiming to front-run a possible TRX outperformance in the coming months,” the Alphractal CEO said. Bitcoin And TRON Price As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just beneath $118,100, reflecting an over 10% increase in the past month. In comparison, TRON is valued at around $0.3197, with an almost 18% price growth in the past 30 days.

2025-07-27 17:07:15+00:00,Ripple Co-Founder’s Big XRP Transfer Sparks New Warnings,"XRP investors are worried again after Ripple Labs co-founder, Chris Larsen, moved 50 million XRP tokens to crypto exchanges. The move has triggered warnings from market analysts. Experts are advising holders to protect themselves from becoming “exit liquidity.” This term refers to a situation where large players sell at high prices, leaving smaller investors to bear the losses. Analysts Say Larger XRP Sell-Off May Be Underway A. Maartunn, a contributor to CryptoQuant, was among the first to raise concerns. In a recent X post , he noted that despite losing over $100 million worth of XRP, Larsen still holds a large amount of the token. The industry leader currently owns about 2.58 billion XRP, valued at around $8.83 billion. Maartunn warned that the recent 50 million XRP sale could be just a small part of what might come next. The alert came shortly after XRP reached a price of $3.60 on July 17, marking a near all-time high. XRP recently became one of the best-performing coins during the market’s rebound. However, the excitement did not last long after analysts spotted large withdrawals from a wallet linked to Larsen. As of now, XRP is trading at $3.18, down 1.06% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data. This represents a 13% drop from its recent high , causing small investors to become more worried, especially those who bought in with the expectation that the price would continue to rise. Ripple Sale Comes Amid Broader Market Turmoil The timing of Larsen’s transaction coincided with market uncertainty, exacerbating investor fear. At the same time, XRP prices were reacting to the sale, and Bitcoin (BTC) was also experiencing sharp downside pressure. An early Bitcoin investor, known as a “Satoshi-era whale,” has sold 80,000 BTC after holding it for 14 years. The sale, managed by Galaxy Digital, temporarily pushed Bitcoin’s price down to around $114,500 before it bounced back to $118,356. This sudden price swing affected the whole crypto market. In just 24 hours, over $500 million was lost in forced trades, according to CoinGlass. These losses primarily affected traders who had leveraged funds to trade and were forced to close their positions when prices moved too quickly. Mixed Reaction from the Community The cryptocurrency community has held differing opinions about Larsen’s move. Some people argue that it is normal for long-term holders to take profits, especially when prices rise. Others believe the sale was planned to capitalize on the recent price surge, potentially harming smaller investors who purchased during the excitement. Some traders also warned about the risks of copying large wallets without careful consideration. They said these moves can shake the market and leave small investors at risk.

Feng and his seven co-defendants were sentenced by the Beijing Haidian District People''s Court to prison terms ranging from three to 14 years and six months, as well as fines, for “embezzlement through abuse of office.” The verdict is final. The prosecutor''s office also seized more than 90 Bitcoins, partially compensating the company for its losses. *This is not investment advice.

In a recent post on X, Pantoja suggested that while XRP may not hit $1,000 anytime soon , not this year or next, it could eventually reach that level, provided investors are patient enough to wait a decade or more. XRP in a Bear Trap: A Time to Accumulate? Pantoja describes the current market phase as a “huge bear trap,” where panic selling has shaken out weak hands. He believes XRP is severely undervalued due to lingering uncertainty from the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, which he argues has reset the token’s growth trajectory. The legal setback, he says, brought XRP “back to square one,” echoing how Bitcoin took eight years to stabilize above the $1,000 mark. Pantoja remains undeterred: “A 33,233% return? I’ll wait 10+ years for that.” $XRP to $1,000? Not tomorrow. Not this year, not next year…..But eventually. Yes. Right now, we’re inside a huge XRP bear trap. Many panicked and sold. ⁰ #XRP ’s lawsuit pushed us back to square one. Remember, $BTC took 8 years just to stay above $1,000. A 33,233% return?… pic.twitter.com/6qE7fYf8jV — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 26, 2025 Legal Hurdles and Regulatory Reset The SEC’s ongoing legal battle with Ripple has been a major headwind. Although Ripple scored a partial win in 2023, securing clarity that XRP isn’t a security when sold on exchanges, it still faces penalties related to institutional sales. A recent attempt by both Ripple and the SEC to reduce a $125 million penalty and remove a permanent injunction was rejected by Judge Analisa Torres in June 2025. Ripple has shown willingness to withdraw its counter-appeal, and while the SEC has not yet formally dropped its appeal, both parties appear poised to move forward without additional litigation. The court has ordered a joint status report by August 15, 2025, which could mark a turning point in the case and in XRP’s regulatory clarity. Institutional Moves and a Banking License in Play Backing his long-term thesis, Pantoja recently disclosed a significant XRP accumulation during a sharp 19% price drop in mid-July. His conviction stems from Ripple’s fundamental utility in cross-border payments and its pursuit of a U.S. national banking license, a move he believes will legitimize XRP’s role in institutional finance. He argues that if XRP’s market cap were to eventually rival Bitcoin’s, the token could climb as high as $36.42. While that’s a far cry from the $1,000 mark, it lays the foundation for future exponential growth as adoption increases over time.

Long-term models suggest XRP could hit $10 to $15 by the end of the decade if key regulatory and adoption milestones are met. However, projections of $100 or more remain speculative and depend heavily on global financial integration. Final Thoughts: Patience Required Armando Pantoja’s vision is not about short-term price action but a patient, utility-driven rally fueled by adoption and clarity.

2025-07-27 17:34:24+00:00,Silicon Valley Startup Says It Can Turn Mercury Into Gold on ‘Massive Scale’,"A Silicon Valley startup says it has discovered the pinnacle of alchemy – converting a relatively common metal into gold. Marathon Fusion is proposing a process that uses nuclear fusion to turn mercury into gold, reports the Economic Times. In a scientific paper, the firms says it’s possible to use high-energy neutrons from a fusion reactor to bombard mercury-198, turning it into mercury-197, which then decays into stable gold-197 over a matter of days. The company says the process is extremely promising, but remains theoretical and is not yet implemented at scale. “Our approach is economically irresistible, practically feasible, and massively scalable, in contrast to prior attempts. An entirely new golden age begins now.” The paper, which has not yet been peer reviewed, claims the gold can be created as a byproduct at nuclear power stations “without any compromise to fuel self-sufficiency or power output.” The method promises to create 5,000 kilograms of gold annually using a one-gigawatt fusion power plant. Marathon Fusion was co-founded by a former SpaceX engineer and a Breakthrough Energy Fellow. It has raised over $10.9 million in funding, including a $5.9 million seed round in July 2024 led by 1517 Fund and Anglo American, with additional support from the U.S. Department of Energy’s ARPA-E, Breakthrough Energy Fellows, Übermorgen Ventures and the Shared Future Fund.

According to details shared by CNN, the EU has agreed to purchase $750 billion worth of energy from the US, as well as invest an additional $600 billion. The initial 30% tariffs on almost all goods, aside from steel and aluminum, which will be set at 50%, were announced two weeks ago and were supposed to be enforced starting on August 1.

2025-07-27 18:30:17+00:00,Crypto Whales Are Dumping Ethereum For Cardano — What’s Behind The Shift?,"Besides storing digital assets, crypto wallets tell stories about the occurrences or trends in the cryptocurrency market. Even more interesting are the stories told by wallets of the bigger participants — the whales. Tracking the transactions of these addresses can offer insight into market sentiment, as they often act as silent signals of future trends. For instance, whales of two of the largest cryptocurrencies — Ethereum and Cardano — seem to be telling some stories at the moment — two different yet related tales. Diverging Paths — ETH Whales Slowly Exit, While ADA Giants Enter In a recent post on X, the social media platform, Alphractal CEO & founder Joao Wedson shared on-chain insights into a growing divergence in the activities of Ethereum and Cardano’s whales. The relevant indicators here are the ETH and ADA Large Holder Share Top100 metrics, which track the percentage of Ethereum’s and Cardano’s total supplies held by the top largest wallets. This metric is particularly useful in figuring out if the major holders are accumulating or distributing their coins. In the post on X, Wedson pointed out that the top 100 holders of Ether tokens have been consistently reducing their holdings. The analyst explained that, since May, their share of the Ethereum supply has dropped from 22% to about 19.6%. This means that the holdings of the large investors have decreased by 2.9 million ETH in that period. On the other hand, Wedson highlighted that the top 100 holders of ADA have been “steadily accumulating day by day.” He explained that this signals confidence in the token and could be a sign that strategic positionings are occurring in anticipation of future bullish rallies. What Could This Mean? The crypto pundit went on to point out that these large addresses are associated with exchanges, but it does not take away the fact that Cardano seems more attractive at the moment. “From this perspective, Cardano currently looks more attractive based on large player behavior,” Wedson said. In what seemed like salient advice, Wedson rehashed the importance of closely following the smart moves these crypto whales make, as they may reveal where the market is headed. At press time, Ethereum, the “king of altcoins”, is valued at about $3,766, reflecting a 0.6% price increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the price of ETH has had a slightly impressive performance of over 3% in the past week. Cardano, on the other hand, is worth $0.8297, reflecting a mere 0.6% price jump in the past 24 hours. ADA’s 7-day action was also barely impressive, ending the week with about a 1.5% loss of its value.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-whales-ethereum-for-cardano-do-they-know/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA,Ethereum|ADA|ADAUSDT|Cardano|ETH|ETHUSDT,BTC,"Crypto Whales Are Dumping Ethereum For Cardano — What’s Behind The Shift?.

Diverging Paths — ETH Whales Slowly Exit, While ADA Giants Enter In a recent post on X, the social media platform, Alphractal CEO & founder Joao Wedson shared on-chain insights into a growing divergence in the activities of Ethereum and Cardano’s whales. The relevant indicators here are the ETH and ADA Large Holder Share Top100 metrics, which track the percentage of Ethereum’s and Cardano’s total supplies held by the top largest wallets. This metric is particularly useful in figuring out if the major holders are accumulating or distributing their coins. In the post on X, Wedson pointed out that the top 100 holders of Ether tokens have been consistently reducing their holdings. The analyst explained that, since May, their share of the Ethereum supply has dropped from 22% to about 19.6%. This means that the holdings of the large investors have decreased by 2.9 million ETH in that period. On the other hand, Wedson highlighted that the top 100 holders of ADA have been “steadily accumulating day by day.” He explained that this signals confidence in the token and could be a sign that strategic positionings are occurring in anticipation of future bullish rallies. What Could This Mean? The crypto pundit went on to point out that these large addresses are associated with exchanges, but it does not take away the fact that Cardano seems more attractive at the moment. “From this perspective, Cardano currently looks more attractive based on large player behavior,” Wedson said. In what seemed like salient advice, Wedson rehashed the importance of closely following the smart moves these crypto whales make, as they may reveal where the market is headed. At press time, Ethereum, the “king of altcoins”, is valued at about $3,766, reflecting a 0.6% price increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the price of ETH has had a slightly impressive performance of over 3% in the past week. Cardano, on the other hand, is worth $0.8297, reflecting a mere 0.6% price jump in the past 24 hours. ADA’s 7-day action was also barely impressive, ending the week with about a 1.5% loss of its value."

According to a new analysis posted by Egrag Crypto on the social media platform X, XRP’s 21 EMA and 55 SMA weekly crossover has been playing out quite nicely, with XRP recently hitting $3.65 on July 18 before cooling off. Now, this analysis projects that the pattern may still be in its early stages. Based on historical outcomes, XRP might be on track to reach as high as $9 or even $24. Related Reading: Wall Street’s Bold Bet: Bitcoin Could Hit $200K By December, Banking Giant Says Bull Crosses Cause Massive Rallies For XRP EGRAG’s chart, which displays XRP’s weekly price action with the 21 EMA and 55 SMA trendlines, shows that each time a bullish crossover occurred between the two trendlines, it marked the beginning of a strong price rally. The first instance of such a cross was in March 2017, and by the end of that cycle, XRP’s price had reached a peak that represented a 40,000% surge from its low. Then in August 2020, a similar crossover produced a 750% pump before topping out. The most recent bullish crossover occurred in October 2024 and has so far resulted in a 560% rise from XRP’s bottom in September 2024. However, there was a similar temporary pump in April 2023 that Egrag excluded from his model. Based on different assumptions about the previous price playout between the two cycles, the analyst outlined two possible targets for the current cycle. The first projection is a 1,500% rally, double that of 2020’s run, which would place the price peak for this cycle at $9. The second projection is a 4,000% rally, which represents just 10% of the massive 2017 spike. This second, more bullish projection places XRP’s price peak anywhere at $24. Chart Image From X: Egrag Crypto XRP Drops To Retest $3 After New ATH At $3.65 After reaching a new cycle high of $3.65 on July 18, XRP failed to hold above the $3.21 resistance zone and corrected down to test the $3.00 support level on July 24. The price volatility, although strong, wasn’t enough to break this support level. Crypto analyst CasiTrades also weighed in on the current technical setup by pointing to an Elliott Wave count that suggests a major third wave is about to begin. In her analysis posted on X, she confirmed that XRP has completed a subwave 2 correction, reaching the deep 0.854 Fibonacci retracement level before bouncing. What’s important here is that the price held above $3, never forming a new low, which is probably now a new price floor. Chart Image From X: CasiTrades Related Reading: Crypto’s Golden Rule Just Got Broken, According To Analyst If buying volume increases and XRP regains its hold above $3.21, the next move is to target $3.82, which coincides with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension. Interestingly, the analyst noted that $3.82 also aligns with what many platforms historically recorded as XRP’s new all-time high. Should XRP close a weekly candle above $3.82, it could lead to prices that align with Egrag’s projections. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.17.

This is the plan.” His statement comes amid heightened market volatility and renewed speculation surrounding XRP’s trajectory and potential for the token’s ascent to $24. According to Crypto Lord, recent price dips aimed at triggering panic selling failed to shake the resolve of long-term holders. Instead, investor confidence remains intact, and that may set the stage for the next leg up. XRP Price Holds Firm Amid Market Volatility After a sharp rally to $3.64, XRP briefly pulled back to the $3.16–$3.20 range, where it currently trades. Despite the correction, the price remains above key support at $3.00, a level that has proven resilient amid broader market sell-offs. $XRP shakeout was unsuccessful. Holders remain unfazed.

Technical analysts point to the breakout as a signal of long-term strength, provided XRP can maintain momentum above $3.50 resistance. XRP’s recent pullback followed profit-taking after the breakout. However, analysts still see a clear path toward $5.25 to $6.19, especially if the next rally is backed by increased volume and institutional flows.

Failed Shakeout Validates Holder Conviction Crypto Lord’s assertion that the recent shakeout attempt failed highlights an important trend: XRP holders are no longer easily rattled by short-term volatility. Instead of panic selling, many chose to hold or accumulate during the dip, reinforcing XRP’s position above crucial support levels. This behavior stands in contrast to earlier market phases, where similar pressure resulted in steep declines. Long-term investors appear to be betting on regulatory clarity and broader adoption as drivers of sustainable price growth. The ability to withstand engineered price drops suggests that XRP’s investor base is maturing, further strengthening its foundation. What’s Next for XRP? If XRP can break decisively above $3.60 , analysts believe the token could test highs near $5.00 and potentially climb toward $6.00. However, if the price falls below $3.00, a deeper correction toward $2.60–$2.20 remains possible. The outcome will likely depend on Bitcoin’s performance, overall market sentiment, and the pace of institutional inflows.

According to Hacken’s latest report, this year has emerged as one of the most damaging in recent memory. Access-Control Exploits Dominate Losses The latest figure surpasses last year’s $2.85 billion by over 6%, as security lapses across the sector continue. In a statement, Hacken Co-Founder and CBDO Yevheniia Broshevan said , “2025 has been a wake-up call. In just two quarters, $3.1 billion was lost to access control failures, DeFi vulnerabilities, and social engineering. As blockchain reaches enterprise scale and regulations advance, cybersecurity becomes a core business function. Projects that invest in resilience and security build trust, meet compliance, and protect digital innovation.” The single largest incident was the Q1 Bybit hack, where attackers drained nearly $1.5 billion. The incident alone accounted for 83% of Q1’s total losses and highlighted the catastrophic risks tied to compromised access control systems. In total, access-control exploits dominated the landscape and were responsible for about 59% of all funds lost, approximately $1.83 billion, across DeFi and CeFi platforms. DeFi Suffers Worst Quarter Since 2023 DeFi suffered its worst quarter since early 2023, with $300 million drained in Q2 alone. Smart contract flaws played a crucial role, as this cohort accounted for 8% of total crypto losses and led to $263 million stolen, including $223 million in the major Cetus exploit this year. Phishing and social-engineering scams also surged to new records. In fact, a single incident in April saw a victim lose $330 million in Bitcoin after being tricked, while phone-based scams mimicking Coinbase support drained over $100 million following a contact data leak. While Q1 was marred by large-scale access control failures, Q2 was comparatively quieter. The period witnessed under $200 million lost to similar exploits, yet several high-profile incidents showed how a single overpowered role or leaked key can enable attackers to drain systems within minutes.

This bullish price prediction comes following a slight 2.6% price rebound over the past two days, pushing Bitcoin within the $118,000 price range. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Still Tumble Down To $109,000 — This Chart Pattern Suggests So $110K Emerges As Crucial Bitcoin Support Zone – Here’s Why In an X post on July 26, Ali Martinez postulates that Bitcoin may be on track for a significant leg higher based on recent data from the MVRV pricing bands by Glassnode. However, the premier cryptocurrency must avoid losing a certain support zone to prevent an invalidation of this bullish thesis. The MVRV bands, derived from Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios, help visualize when Bitcoin is either overvalued or undervalued relative to its historical realized price. These bands function like Bollinger Bands but are grounded in on-chain fundamentals, tracking statistical deviations around the mean MVRV value. As of July 23, 2025, Bitcoin was trading at approximately $118,782, following a steady climb over recent weeks. According to the MVRV pricing model, the cryptocurrency was hovering just beneath the +1.0σ deviation band, marked at $130,756, representing the next major price resistance and target. Notably, the +1.0σ band is also interpreted as a key zone of extreme market optimism, often preceding local tops (+2.0σ) On the other hand, the model’s +0.5σ band sat at $109,858 below the current market prices, serving as a vital support threshold. Ali Marinez explains that Bitcoin must maintain its price level above this band to retain a high probability of continuation toward the +1.0σ level target based on historical patterns. However, a breakdown below $110,000 could signal a deeper correction, potentially down to the mean band at around $88,960, or lower toward $68,062 (-0.5σ).

2025-07-27 20:29:05+00:00,Elon Musk’s America Party Community Token Surges as Tesla Owners Silicon Valley & @theXtakeover Team Up with @AmericaPartyX,"The buzz around Elon Musk’s America Party just got louder. Tesla Owners Silicon Valley recently confirmed that The X Takeover , the world’s largest gathering for Tesla and SpaceX enthusiasts, is partnering with @AmericaPartyX to deliver the event’s official wrap-up video. Scheduled for July 26, this collaboration puts Musk’s new political movement—and its growing online presence—front and center at a major event for his most dedicated supporters. The X Takeover Meets the America Party The X Takeover is known as a premier annual event celebrating Musk’s ventures, drawing thousands of Tesla, SpaceX, and tech enthusiasts from around the globe. This year, with the America Party entering the public spotlight, the partnership signals more than just an event highlight—it’s a symbolic merging of Musk’s influence across technology, politics, and culture. By aligning with @AmericaPartyX, the event gives Musk’s movement exposure to a highly engaged audience, many of whom share the same enthusiasm for innovation, disruption, and bold ideas that the America Party promotes. Growing Momentum for @AmericaPartyX The America Party, announced by Elon Musk on July 5, 2025, aims to challenge the U.S. political duopoly with a platform built on fiscal conservatism, AI-driven modernization, and support for Bitcoin adoption. High-profile figures like Mark Cuban and Andrew Yang have already expressed support, while the movement itself continues to build grassroots momentum through social media. The upcoming collaboration with The X Takeover amplifies this momentum, linking the political project with a key cultural touchpoint for Musk’s global fanbase. A Subtle Crypto Undercurrent While not officially linked, the America Party Token (AP) —a community-created cryptocurrency inspired by the movement—has also been riding the wave of this new political energy. The token has experienced significant early gains since its launch and remains a focal point for speculative traders looking to ride the hype. Its contract address is 0xe60e9BD04ccc0a394f1fDf29874e35a773cb07f4 , and the project can be found at americaparty.meme . The timing couldn’t be more favorable. W ith The X Takeover and @AmericaPartyX partnership shining a spotlight on the movement, the community surrounding the token is likely to see renewed attention—especially from crypto-savvy Tesla and SpaceX enthusiasts who thrive on innovation and early adoption. Looking Ahead The partnership between The X Takeover and @AmericaPartyX demonstrates how seamlessly Musk’s ventures—and their surrounding communities—are blending across industries. Whether it’s electric vehicles, space exploration, political reform, or meme-driven digital assets, the Musk ecosystem continues to expand and interconnect in unexpected ways. As the wrap-up video debuts after July 26, all eyes will be on how the America Party leverages this momentum. For the community, the event represents not just a celebration of Musk’s achievements but also a potential launchpad for the next wave of political and cultural disruption. Conclusion With The X Takeover now aligning with @AmericaPartyX , the America Party enters a new phase of visibility. The cross-pollination of technology, politics, and crypto enthusiasm signals that this movement is far from a fleeting headline. Whether it transforms U.S. politics or fuels a speculative surge in the token market, one thing is clear: Musk’s influence continues to shape the conversation across every domain it touches.

2025-07-27 20:59:39+00:00,"BNB Hits New High, Meme Stocks Soar, ETH ETFs See Inflows: Binance Report","This past week, a fresh wave of retail euphoria swept through U.S. equities and crypto markets, with meme stocks roaring back into vogue and altcoins teasing the arrival of a long-awaited altseason. According to the latest Binance Research report, the risk-on sentiment was powered by strong economic data, AI-driven tech optimism, and institutional crypto flows, especially into Ethereum (ETH) ETFs. Altcoins Whipsaw While Bitcoin (BTC) has cooled , hovering between $116,000 and $119,000, Binance Coin (BNB) stole the show, smashing through $800 to register a new all-time high on July 23. The rally was sparked by news that Nano Labs, a Nasdaq-listed firm, had built a $90 million BNB treasury as part of a wider trend where companies are diversifying beyond BTC and ETH. Binance Research highlighted BNB’s superior risk-adjusted returns, boasting a five-year Sharpe ratio of 2.5, meaning it has delivered $2.50 in returns for every $1 of risk taken. This performance has outpaced both traditional indices and other major cryptocurrencies, reinforcing BNB’s appeal to sophisticated investors. Meanwhile, between July 21 and July 24, U.S. Ethereum ETFs saw nearly $1.4 billion in net inflows, eclipsing BTC’s nearly $59 million outflows in the same period. The latest weekly surge brings ETH exchange-traded funds’ inflows for July to $4.67 billion. Analysts now point to these flows as a sign that institutional investors are increasingly warming to altcoins, particularly the world’s second-largest crypto asset by market cap. Despite the bullish momentum, the crypto market remains volatile. Just a day before the Binance Research report landed, altcoins suffered a sharp correction, wiping over $100 billion from the total market cap. Coins like XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE) plummeted by double digits, with some, like Aptos (APT), dropping as much as 16%. This pullback has reignited debates over whether the altseason has truly begun or if we are merely in the middle of a speculative bubble. Although buoyed by strong ETF inflows, Ethereum has seen its ETH/BTC ratio decline by 7.4% from its recent peak. At the same time, Bitcoin’s dominance, which had dipped below 60%, has rebounded slightly as the rest of the market retraced. Analysts are closely watching whether the flagship cryptocurrency can break past the $120,000 resistance level, a move some say could dictate the next phase of the market cycle. Meme Stocks Soar On the Wall Street front, Binance Research noted the surprise return of retail mania this week, with investors piling into meme stocks once again. Kohl’s, for example, skyrocketed nearly 90%, while GoPro jumped 49% in intraday activity. This resurgence mirrors the 2021 GameStop frenzy, possibly pointing to a revival of speculative trading fueled by social media hype and FOMO. Elsewhere, the S&P 500 hit a record 6,358.91 on July 23, driven by AI-led earnings beats and easing trade tensions after the U.S.–Japan tariff deal. Looking ahead, Binance says key macroeconomic events, including Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan meetings, U.S. GDP data, and the looming August 1 tariff deadline, could sway market sentiment. Additionally, the report noted that regulatory developments, such as potential Solana ETF approvals, may further shape crypto’s trajectory in the coming weeks.

2025-07-27 21:15:13+00:00,Panic Selling Could Crash Bitcoin – What Investors Need to Know Now,"Bitcoin’s price took a hit this week after blockchain tracking platforms revealed a massive sell-off triggered by a dormant whale. Galaxy Digital, acting as the intermediary, moved nearly 30,000 BTC—valued at over $3.5 billion—onto exchanges like Binance and OKX, igniting fears of a wider market correction. The sell-off is part of a much larger 80,201 BTC trove linked to a wallet dating back to 2011. The most significant transaction came Friday with a 22,610 BTC transfer, followed by several smaller deposits that suggest liquidation was happening in stages. These moves coincided with Bitcoin’s slide below $115,000, down around 3% on the day. Analysts say the scale and timing of these transfers could trigger a ripple effect, spooking other large holders and triggering panic-driven sell-off from leveraged traders. As fear spreads, some traders are rotating into smaller, early-stage assets that may not be as exposed to whale-driven volatility. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE has started gaining traction for its unique momentum and growing interest from smart money circles. Whale Movements Signal Market Tension The data shows that Galaxy has already facilitated the transfer of over 61,000 BTC to exchanges, out of the original 80,000 BTC stash. This includes earlier transfers from July 15 and July 18—strategically timed just after Bitcoin touched an all-time high of $122,838. Now, with over $1.15 billion in stablecoins pulled off exchanges, some observers believe further selling may slow. But the damage could already be underway. Heavy BTC inflows to centralized platforms often trigger automated selling or fear-based reactions among retail and institutional investors alike. If more large holders follow suit, the market could test critical support levels—and fast. What Are Smart Money Investors Looking at? This growing fear is prompting some traders to rethink their exposure and consider projects still in early price discovery phases. One name repeatedly cited in recent research reports is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has already attracted a loyal community and mounting analyst attention. With an 8,700% upside highlighted in the latest analyst review, its positioning has sparked a new wave of strategic buying . Previous rounds sold out rapidly, showing strong conviction from early adopters betting on a repeat of the breakout patterns seen in now-legendary altcoins . MAGACOIN FINANCE is being tracked closely by investors who don’t want to miss out again – especially as new milestones are reached and more utility is revealed in its roadmap. Momentum appears to be building at the exact moment traditional players are showing signs of hesitation. Conclusion Whale-driven volatility is nothing new in crypto, but the scale of this event—over $3.5 billion in Bitcoin hitting exchanges in a matter of days – raises serious questions about short-term price stability. Investors should monitor on-chain activity closely and prepare for possible continued sell pressure. And as many search for opportunity amid uncertainty, early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are being identified as potential high-ROI plays backed by strong community momentum and early demand.

2025-07-27 21:30:23+00:00,This Litecoin Indicator Just Crossed A Critical Level — Here’s What Happened Last Time,"The price of Litecoin has been one of the brightest spots in the altcoin market over the past few weeks, jumping by more than 30% so far in the month of July. The LTC price, however, barely made a dent over the past week, mirroring the sluggish state of the crypto market in recent days. Nevertheless, the future still looks quite promising for Litecoin, with several analysts backing the cryptocurrency to embark on an extended rally over the next few months. In one such evaluation, a market expert on X has said that the price of LTC might be at the beginning of an upward rally. LTC Price Soared 11,900% Last Time This Happened In a July 26 post on the X platform, Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony Severino put forward an exciting prognosis for the price of Litecoin. According to the crypto expert, the altcoin appears on the verge of what might be a defining upward run in the coming months. Related Reading: Solana In The Danger Zone – Will $175 Support Hold Or Collapse? This projection is based on the recent movements of the Litecoin Average Directional Index (ADX) on the monthly timeframe. Average Directional Index is an indicator used in technical analysis to determine the strength of an asset’s price trend. The ADX indicator evaluates the strength of a price trend by measuring the degree of directional movement. These calculations are based on a moving average of price range expansion and contraction within a given timeframe. Typically, when the Average Directional Index is below 20, it implies that the market is consolidating or moving sideways. However, when ADX moves between 20 and 25, it signals that a trend might be forming for the asset. Meanwhile, when the ADX rises above 25, it confirms the formation of a strong trend. Severino noted that the Average Directional Index on the Litecoin monthly timeframe is now above 20, meaning that a trend is forming. Meanwhile, the positive Directional Indicator (DI+) found a support cushion at the ADX line and is now rising. This trend is similar to the one seen in 2017, where the ADX also crossed above the 20 mark and offered support to the DI+ (green line). This phenomenon was followed by a rally that saw the Litecoin price travel from around $3 to as high as $360 (an astounding 11,900% rally). Hence, the price of Litecoin could confirm the start of a strong rally if the ADX keeps rising and eventually sustainably breaches the 25 threshold Litecoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LTC stands at around $114.61, reflecting an over 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

The price of Litecoin has been one of the brightest spots in the altcoin market over the past few weeks, jumping by more than 30% so far in the month of July. The LTC price, however, barely made a dent over the past week, mirroring the sluggish state of the crypto market in recent days. Nevertheless, the future still looks quite promising for Litecoin, with several analysts backing the cryptocurrency to embark on an extended rally over the next few months. In one such evaluation, a market expert on X has said that the price of LTC might be at the beginning of an upward rally. LTC Price Soared 11,900% Last Time This Happened In a July 26 post on the X platform, Chartered Market Technician (CMT) Tony Severino put forward an exciting prognosis for the price of Litecoin. According to the crypto expert, the altcoin appears on the verge of what might be a defining upward run in the coming months. Related Reading: Solana In The Danger Zone – Will $175 Support Hold Or Collapse? This projection is based on the recent movements of the Litecoin Average Directional Index (ADX) on the monthly timeframe. Average Directional Index is an indicator used in technical analysis to determine the strength of an asset’s price trend. The ADX indicator evaluates the strength of a price trend by measuring the degree of directional movement. These calculations are based on a moving average of price range expansion and contraction within a given timeframe. Typically, when the Average Directional Index is below 20, it implies that the market is consolidating or moving sideways. However, when ADX moves between 20 and 25, it signals that a trend might be forming for the asset. Meanwhile, when the ADX rises above 25, it confirms the formation of a strong trend. Severino noted that the Average Directional Index on the Litecoin monthly timeframe is now above 20, meaning that a trend is forming. Meanwhile, the positive Directional Indicator (DI+) found a support cushion at the ADX line and is now rising. This trend is similar to the one seen in 2017, where the ADX also crossed above the 20 mark and offered support to the DI+ (green line).

2025-07-27 22:00:15+00:00,"Here is What XRP Could Be Worth if Bitcoin Hits $200,000","With Bitcoin now stabilizing around $115,600 , speculation is mounting over what a six-figure BTC could mean for other large-cap altcoins. One of the biggest questions? XRP’s price ceiling. At its current level of $3.04 , XRP has held firm despite recent market volatility—but analysts believe that could change drastically if Bitcoin enters the $200,000 zone. Some traders are already adjusting their XRP targets based on projected BTC dominance. A return to previous BTC/XRP ratios could put XRP comfortably above $7 , while more aggressive models point to a range between $10 and $14 if altcoin inflows intensify. Notably, XRP tends to move in delayed cycles relative to Bitcoin, with major catch-up rallies historically following BTC breakouts. In this climate, newer investors are also scanning for altcoins with early-mover potential. One name gaining traction is MAGACOIN FINANCE , which is being positioned by insiders as a high-upside alternative to traditional large caps. Can XRP Ride the Bitcoin Surge to $10? The case for XRP pushing toward $10 rests on two main pillars: a supply squeeze driven by long-term holders, and a favorable regulatory environment. Legal clarity from the SEC case continues to unlock institutional access, while Ripple’s partnerships across Asia and the Middle East have positioned XRP as a central bridge currency in new payment corridors. If Bitcoin crosses $200K, analysts believe capital rotation into altcoins like XRP will accelerate. Historical trends suggest altcoins often outperform BTC after major bull run peaks, meaning XRP could be poised for a sharp upward repricing—especially as XRP’s supply is already heavily consolidated in wallets that haven’t moved in months. Early Buyers Are Eyeing a 52x Return—But Not from XRP While XRP’s growth may be steady and supported by infrastructure, some investors are targeting faster upside elsewhere. MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently leading that conversation, with analysts citing a 52x return forecast based on surging early demand and compressed token supply. Adoption is already outpacing previous market cycles , and each new tier of its presale has been selling out quicker than the last. For those looking to enter before wider exposure hits, this may be one of the final entry windows available . Institutional Liquidity and Technical Triggers Even in a conservative scenario, XRP reclaiming 2021’s relative strength could mean a 2x–3x gain from current levels. But with increasing whale activity and fresh inflows into XRP-related products, the probability of a breakout above $5 is rising. Should BTC lead the market into uncharted territory, XRP could finally break through long-standing resistance zones. Multiple trading desks have already mapped the technical path to $10, noting that it may not take much volume to push the price up once key levels are breached. Conclusion XRP’s price potential is clearly tied to Bitcoin’s next big move—and the $200K mark could be the trigger. While XRP’s ceiling could reach $10–$14 in a strong alt season, others are betting on even bigger upside plays.

2025-07-27 22:39:16+00:00,Popular YouTube Streamer Built Creative Defense Against Crypto Scams,"Kitboga, a well-known YouTube and Twitch streamer, has developed a unique system to combat crypto scam tactics. Reportedly, he used a fake Bitcoin ATM website that leads scammers into a confusing digital maze. With this tactic, he and his team have wasted nearly 4,000 hours of the bad actor’s time. More importantly, this method has helped collect information to report scammers and stop their operations. Kitboga Deploys Fake Bitcoin ATM to Disrupt and Delay Scammers In many scam cases, bad actors often trick their victims into depositing money into Bitcoin ATMs . To counter this, Kitboga created a fake crypto ATM receipt and website. The QR code on the receipt directs scammers to a fake crypto exchange. Then the listed 1-800 support line goes directly to Kitboga’s team. This is how the scammers enter the maze. On the fake website, scammers encounter unusual and time-consuming challenges. Eventually, they are told to enter their Bitcoin wallet address, but the system never accepts it. That is when they are asked to call the supposed hotline. When scammers call the number, they are directed to a lengthy automated menu. They are asked to enter the last four digits of their wallet address, which is always misheard by the system. After a few failed attempts, they are informed that they will be connected to a live person. Instead, scammers hear the sounds of a fax machine, a call center, or total silence. Also, scammers must say strange phrases every few minutes to stay connected on the call. These steps ensure the scammer’s full attention is taken, preventing them from targeting new victims during that time. Kitboga’s Crypto Scam Maze Doubles as a Trap for Valuable Evidence The maze is not only for wasting time. It also helps Kitboga and his team gather real information. If the scammer thinks they are about to get money from a trusted exchange, they might reveal their main crypto wallet or even allow access to their camera. This data is then passed on to law enforcement. According to Kitboga, this maze is his second-best method for wasting scammers’ time. He said his AI bots, which call scammers on their own, are more effective at keeping them busy. However, for collecting real, practical details, the maze is the most powerful tool he has. A Growing Effort with Real Impact Over a year, Kitboga’s fake Bitcoin ATM trap has wasted 3,953 hours of scammers’ time, averaging about three hours per person. The longest anyone stayed in the maze was 156 hours, over six days. His team, consisting of 12 people, identifies scammers and pretends to be victims during calls. While some interactions are for content, others aim to gather serious evidence. His efforts have already helped freeze scammer funds stored on trusted crypto platforms .

2025-07-27 23:00:32+00:00,"Dormant Whale Sells $80,000 BTC, But Bitcoin Bulls Still In Control","A Bitcoin whale from the early 2010s, holding coins mined or acquired in Bitcoin’s infancy, recently awakened and sold 80,000 BTC. The sale was handled by Galaxy Digital, which executed the transfer of over 80,000 BTC (worth $9 billion) on behalf of this client, who is described as a “Satoshi-era” investor. Despite this massive sale and the volatility that came after, Bitcoin has managed to steady and the ensuing price action shows that bulls were more than prepared to absorb the sell shock. Related Reading: Wall Street’s Bold Bet: Bitcoin Could Hit $200K By December, Banking Giant Says Bitcoin Dips To $115,000, Bulls Quickly Bought The Dip News of the $9 billion Bitcoin sale initially caused price volatility. Bitcoin’s price had recently been trading around $119,000, so the sudden influx of sell orders caused a short-lived pullback. On July 25, as reports of Galaxy’s whale sale spread, BTC/USD swiftly fell to around $114,000 to $115,000. The sheer size of 80,000 BTC (over 0.4% of total supply) hitting the market had the potential to trigger panic. Indeed, there were signs of profit-taking and higher exchange inflows in the days surrounding the sale. This, in turn, led to a 3.5% drop, which is one of Bitcoin’s steepest intraday dips in weeks, temporarily breaking below the $115,000 support level. However, it soon became clear that Bitcoin’s bulls were more than prepared to absorb the shock. The price decline bottomed out in mere hours. By the end of that same day, Bitcoin had rebounded above $117,000, and it was trading back in the mid-$117,000. This rapid recovery demonstrated remarkable liquidity and depth in the Bitcoin market. “80,000 BTC, over $9 billion, was sold into open market order books, and Bitcoin barely moved,” observed crypto analyst Joe Consorti, showing how quickly buyers stepped in to counter the selling pressure. Image From X: Joe Consorti Back in earlier years, a sell order of this magnitude could have triggered a double-digit percentage price crash. By contrast, the ecosystem in 2025 handled it with surprising ease. “The entire sale has been fully absorbed by the market,” noted Bitcoin analyst Jason Williams. What’s Next For Bitcoin Price? With the whale’s 80,000 BTC sale now largely in the rearview mirror, the next step is looking ahead to where Bitcoin might go from here. The fact that the market digested a $9 billion sell-off with only minor turbulence has many observers feeling even more bullish about Bitcoin’s trajectory. “We’re going so much higher,” Jason Williams noted. It’s a sentiment shared by several crypto analysts on X, who see the quick recovery as evidence of strong upward momentum. The consensus among bulls is that new all-time highs could be on the horizon in the coming months. Bitcoin already notched a record around $123,000 on July 14, but analysts are still calling for new highs above $130,000, $150,000, or even higher.

2025-07-27 23:45:11+00:00,Bitcoin Laundering Unveiled: China Busts Massive $20M Scheme,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Laundering Unveiled: China Busts Massive $20M Scheme The world of cryptocurrency, often lauded for its decentralization and perceived anonymity, sometimes becomes an unwitting stage for illicit activities. A recent bombshell from Beijing has sent ripples through the digital asset community: Chinese authorities have successfully dismantled a sophisticated Bitcoin laundering scheme, exposing vulnerabilities even within seemingly secure corporate environments. This isn’t just another headline; it’s a stark reminder that even in the rapidly evolving landscape of digital finance, traditional crimes find new avenues. The case involves significant sums, high-profile entities, and cutting-edge investigative techniques, offering crucial insights into the ongoing global battle against financial crime in the crypto space. The Anatomy of a $20 Million Bitcoin Laundering Scheme Imagine a digital heist where the perpetrators weren’t masked strangers breaking into a vault, but trusted insiders exploiting their positions. This is precisely what unfolded within Kuaishou, China’s second-largest short-video platform, where a cunning Bitcoin laundering operation was recently brought to light. Prosecutors in Beijing’s Haidian District revealed a staggering scheme where company insiders embezzled nearly 140 million yuan, equivalent to approximately $20 million USD. The method used to conceal these ill-gotten gains was sophisticated, designed to obscure the money’s origin and destination. The perpetrators funneled the embezzled funds through a complex web involving: Eight Overseas Crypto Exchanges: These platforms, often operating with varying degrees of regulatory oversight, served as conduits for converting the yuan into cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin. The sheer number of exchanges used suggests an attempt to fragment the trail and make it harder to follow. Crypto Mixers (Tumblers): A critical component of the scheme, mixers are services that pool together large amounts of cryptocurrency from various users and then redistribute them, effectively scrambling the transaction history. This process aims to break the link between the original source of funds and their final destination, making tracing extremely difficult. The goal was clear: to transform dirty fiat money into seemingly clean, untraceable digital assets, thereby evading detection and prosecution. However, as this case powerfully demonstrates, the myth of complete anonymity in crypto transactions is increasingly being debunked by advanced investigative capabilities. How Did Investigators Unravel This Bitcoin Laundering Plot? The very nature of cryptocurrency, with its perceived anonymity, often leads criminals to believe their digital footprints are untraceable. However, as this case demonstrates, dedicated investigators possess increasingly sophisticated tools and expertise to follow the money, even when it’s funneled through complex networks of digital transactions. So, what was the secret to unraveling this intricate Bitcoin laundering scheme? Beijing authorities, specifically the Haidian District prosecutors, showcased remarkable investigative prowess. Their success highlights several key aspects of modern crypto forensics: Advanced Tracing Techniques: Despite the use of mixers and multiple exchanges, investigators employed sophisticated blockchain analysis tools and techniques. These tools can de-anonymize transactions by analyzing patterns, linking addresses, and leveraging publicly available blockchain data. International Cooperation: Given that the funds were funneled through eight overseas crypto exchanges, it is highly probable that the investigation involved significant international collaboration with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions. This cross-border cooperation is crucial in combating global financial crimes. Intelligence Gathering: Beyond technical tracing, traditional intelligence gathering, likely involving informants, digital surveillance, and analysis of communication, played a vital role in identifying the insiders at Kuaishou and understanding their modus operandi. Persistence and Resources: Unraveling a scheme of this magnitude requires substantial resources, expertise, and a tenacious commitment from the investigative teams. Their efforts ultimately led to the identification of the culprits and the recovery of a significant portion of the stolen assets. The diligent work paid off handsomely. Investigators managed to trace the illicit funds and successfully recovered 92 BTC, valued at approximately $11.7 million at the time of recovery. This recovered sum has since been returned to Kuaishou, mitigating a substantial portion of the company’s financial loss.

These tools can de-anonymize transactions by analyzing patterns, linking addresses, and leveraging publicly available blockchain data. International Cooperation: Given that the funds were funneled through eight overseas crypto exchanges, it is highly probable that the investigation involved significant international collaboration with law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions. This cross-border cooperation is crucial in combating global financial crimes. Intelligence Gathering: Beyond technical tracing, traditional intelligence gathering, likely involving informants, digital surveillance, and analysis of communication, played a vital role in identifying the insiders at Kuaishou and understanding their modus operandi. Persistence and Resources: Unraveling a scheme of this magnitude requires substantial resources, expertise, and a tenacious commitment from the investigative teams. Their efforts ultimately led to the identification of the culprits and the recovery of a significant portion of the stolen assets. The diligent work paid off handsomely. Investigators managed to trace the illicit funds and successfully recovered 92 BTC, valued at approximately $11.7 million at the time of recovery. This recovered sum has since been returned to Kuaishou, mitigating a substantial portion of the company’s financial loss. The Broader Implications of Bitcoin Laundering on the Crypto Ecosystem Beyond the immediate financial losses and legal repercussions for those involved, the exposure of such a significant Bitcoin laundering operation carries profoun"
2025-07-28 00:25:10+00:00,Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding the Surging Market Optimism at 75,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding the Surging Market Optimism at 75 Ever wonder what truly drives the unpredictable tides of the cryptocurrency market? Is it pure speculation, or is there a measurable pulse of collective investor emotion? Enter the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a fascinating barometer that offers a snapshot of the market’s prevailing sentiment. As of July 28, this pivotal index soared to a robust 75, firmly embedding itself within the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this significant shift mean for you, the investor, and what insights can we glean from this surge in optimism? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 75 Mean? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , developed by software platform Alternative, serves as a crucial gauge for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, this index provides a clear spectrum: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This typically indicates that investors are overly worried, often a sign of undervaluation and a potential buying opportunity for contrarian investors. 25-49: Fear – Still a cautious market, but less intense than extreme fear. 50-74: Greed – This zone, where the index currently sits at 75, suggests growing optimism and increasing buying pressure. 75-100: Extreme Greed – A market in this state is often characterized by euphoria and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). While prices might continue to rise, it also signals a higher risk of market correction due to potential overvaluation. The recent rise to 75, up two points from the previous day, signifies a strong sentiment of ‘Greed’ pervading the crypto landscape. This elevated score suggests that market participants are feeling confident, even bullish, about future price movements. Such a reading can reflect a period of sustained price increases, positive news cycles, or a general belief in the market’s upward trajectory. Decoding Market Psychology: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The strength of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach to gauging market sentiment. It doesn’t rely on a single metric but rather aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted to provide a comprehensive overview. Understanding these components is essential to interpreting the index’s readings accurately: Factor Weighting Description Volatility 25% Measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Compares the current volume and market momentum of Bitcoin to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High buying volume and strong momentum typically indicate greed. Social Media 15% Analyzes cryptocurrency-related hashtags and mentions on various social media platforms, assessing the speed and volume of posts. More positive and active discussions can suggest greed. Surveys 15% Gauges investor sentiment through weekly polls. Note: Currently, this factor is paused, meaning the index relies more heavily on the other five components. Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization. An increasing dominance often indicates fear (investors flocking to ‘safer’ Bitcoin), while decreasing dominance can signal greed (altcoin season). Google Trends 10% Analyzes search query trends related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Sudden increases in ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘Bitcoin crash’ searches, for example, might indicate fear. The temporary pausing of surveys means the remaining five factors carry a slightly larger effective weight, making it even more crucial to understand their individual contributions to the overall Crypto Fear & Greed Index score. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Opportunities and Risks for Crypto Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, as it is at 75, it presents a dual landscape of opportunities and potential pitfalls for investors. Understanding how to navigate this environment is key to making informed decisions. Potential Opportunities: Sustained Upward Momentum: High greed often coincides with bullish market trends, where prices are rising, and investor confidence can fuel further gains. This can be an opportune time for those holding assets to see their portfolios appreciate. Increased Liquidity: A greedy market typically sees higher trading volumes, making it easier to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. New Investor Influx: Positive sentiment can attract new capital into the market, further supporting asset prices and potentially driving innovation. Potential Risks and Challenges: Overvaluation and Bubbles: Extreme greed can lead to assets being overvalued, forming speculative bubbles that are unsustainable in the long run. Prices might detach from fundamental value. Increased Volatility: While positive, high greed can also precede periods of increased volatility, where sharp corr",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-optimism-2/,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|RESEARCH,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Crypto Fear & Greed Index.|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Investment|Market Sentiment.,BTC,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding the Surging Market Optimism at 75.

Today, all eyes are on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as CME Bitcoin futures opened with a remarkable jump, creating ripples across the digital asset landscape. This significant higher open isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of evolving perceptions and growing confidence in Bitcoin’s future. What Just Happened with CME Bitcoin Futures? The financial markets woke up to a notable development today: CME Bitcoin futures began trading at an impressive $120,065. This figure represents a substantial increase of $1,770 from the previous close of $118,295, as observed on the four-hour chart data from TradingView. This isn’t merely a minor fluctuation; it’s a pronounced gap up, indicating strong buying pressure and a bullish outlook right from the opening bell. For those new to the concept, Bitcoin futures are financial contracts that allow investors to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying cryptocurrency. The CME, a leading global derivatives marketplace, launched its Bitcoin futures contracts in December 2017, providing a regulated avenue for institutional investors and sophisticated traders to gain exposure to Bitcoin. The CME’s offerings are particularly significant because they are cash-settled, meaning no actual Bitcoin changes hands, reducing some of the operational complexities associated with holding digital assets. Why Does a Higher Open in CME Bitcoin Futures Matter So Much? A gap up of this magnitude in CME Bitcoin futures carries significant weight for several reasons: Institutional Confidence: The CME is primarily a playground for institutional players – hedge funds, asset managers, and large financial institutions. Their willingness to bid up prices significantly at the open suggests a robust appetite for Bitcoin exposure and a collective belief in its upward trajectory. This isn’t retail FOMO; it’s calculated institutional conviction. Market Sentiment Indicator: Futures markets often act as leading indicators for the underlying asset. A strong open in CME futures can signal broader bullish sentiment for Bitcoin itself, potentially influencing spot market prices as well. It reflects a positive shift in the collective market psychology. Liquidity and Price Discovery: The CME market provides crucial liquidity and contributes to the price discovery mechanism for Bitcoin. A higher open helps solidify Bitcoin’s current valuation and can attract more participants, further deepening the market. Reduced Uncertainty: In times of market volatility, a strong open can provide a sense of stability and direction, reducing uncertainty among investors. It suggests that despite any recent dips or sideways movements, the underlying institutional support for Bitcoin remains strong. What Factors Could Be Driving This Momentum in CME Bitcoin Futures? Understanding the catalysts behind such a move is crucial. Several factors could be contributing to the renewed buying interest in CME Bitcoin futures : Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Broader economic conditions, such as inflation concerns, a weakening dollar, or ongoing geopolitical tensions, can often drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin, which is sometimes seen as a hedge. Anticipation of Spot ETF Inflows: While the US already has spot Bitcoin ETFs, continuous inflows into these funds demonstrate sustained retail and institutional demand, which can spill over into the futures market. New approvals in other jurisdictions could also fuel excitement. Halving Event Aftermath: The recent Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin, historically precedes bull runs. The market might be factoring in the long-term supply shock and its potential impact on price. Positive Regulatory Developments: Any news indicating clearer regulatory frameworks or increased acceptance of cryptocurrencies by governments worldwide can boost investor confidence and encourage more institutional participation. Technical Breakouts: Traders often react to key technical levels. A breakout above a significant resistance level in Bitcoin’s spot price or futures charts could trigger automated buying and attract new long positions. How Do CME Bitcoin Futures Differ from Spot Trading? It’s important to distinguish between trading CME Bitcoin futures and directly buying Bitcoin on a spot exchange. While both involve Bitcoin, their mechanisms and implications are distinct: Feature CME Bitcoin Futures Spot Bitcoin Trading Asset Ownership No direct ownership of Bitcoin; trading contracts based on its price.

2025-07-28 00:30:47+00:00,Bitcoin Price Prediction for August 2025 – Here Is What to Expect,"As the crypto market heads deeper into the second half of 2025, investor focus has returned squarely to Bitcoin, with mounting speculation over where the world’s leading cryptocurrency might be headed in August. After a turbulent Q2 marked by ETF inflows, regulatory shifts, and renewed interest from institutional players, August is shaping up to be a pivotal month. Alongside Bitcoin’s rise, newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also drawing attention from investors eager to position early in what could be the next major altcoin cycle. What August Could Mean for Bitcoin’s Next Big Move Bitcoin began the year with solid gains, reaching above $100,000 by late Q1 before pulling back in June amid broader market cooling. However, current signals suggest renewed strength. On-chain metrics show increasing accumulation from long-term holders, and spot volumes have risen steadily since mid-July. Technical indicators are also flashing green: the weekly RSI remains neutral, leaving room for upward movement, and Bitcoin recently reclaimed its 50-day moving average—a signal historically associated with trend continuation. Analysts point to a potential price range between $110,000 and $135,000 for Bitcoin in August, provided bullish momentum holds. If ETF inflows remain consistent and exchange supply continues to dwindle, that upper band could be reached faster than expected. On the downside, support is building between $92,000 and $98,000, offering a cushion should volatility spike. The Altcoin Catching Attention as Bitcoin Heats Up While Bitcoin dominates macro headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly carving out a path of its own. Following overwhelming demand from early buyers, a new price tier was recently unlocked, underscoring how quickly interest in the project is growing. Its capped supply and milestone-driven roadmap are attracting serious capital, with community numbers climbing and visibility increasing. This emerging altcoin is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about plays of the year. Conclusion Bitcoin’s path for August looks increasingly bullish, with strong potential for a renewed push toward $130K and beyond. But it’s not just Bitcoin that’s catching investor interest. As capital rotates into high-upside opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout, with surging demand and a fast-moving presale unlocking new tiers at a rapid pace.

2025-07-28 00:55:10+00:00,Crucial Economic Events This Week: Navigating Market Volatility,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Economic Events This Week: Navigating Market Volatility In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, understanding the broader economic landscape is not just an advantage—it’s a necessity. While digital assets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the gravitational pull of global macroeconomic forces. This week presents a series of pivotal Economic Events that could send ripples across traditional financial markets and, by extension, influence the volatile crypto ecosystem. For savvy investors and traders, keeping a close eye on these announcements is key to navigating potential market shifts and making informed decisions. Why These Economic Events Matter for Crypto Investors You might be wondering, ‘How do GDP reports or interest rate decisions in the traditional financial world affect my Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings?’ It’s a valid question, and the answer lies in interconnectedness and investor sentiment. Macroeconomic data provides insights into the health of economies, inflation trends, and the likely trajectory of monetary policy. These factors directly influence the flow of capital, risk appetite, and the relative attractiveness of various asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. For instance, when central banks like the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) adjust interest rates, it impacts the cost of borrowing, corporate profits, and the overall liquidity in the financial system. Higher rates can make ‘risk-on’ assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies less appealing compared to ‘safer’, yield-bearing investments like bonds. Conversely, periods of quantitative easing or low-interest rates often encourage investment in riskier assets. Inflation data, employment figures, and economic growth indicators also play a significant role in shaping these monetary policy decisions. Wednesday, July 30: A Day Packed with Critical Economic Events Wednesday is set to be a whirlwind for market watchers, with several high-impact announcements originating from both Europe and the United States. Here’s what’s on the docket: 09:00 UTC: EU GDP (QoQ) (Q2) – A Look at European Economic Health What it is: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the total value of goods and services produced in an economy. The Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) figure indicates the growth or contraction of the economy compared to the previous quarter. Why it matters: The Eurozone’s economic performance impacts global trade and investor confidence. A stronger-than-expected GDP could signal resilience, potentially strengthening the Euro and influencing global risk sentiment. A weaker reading might raise concerns about a recession, leading to a flight to safety and potentially impacting global risk assets, including crypto. Crypto Impact: While not a direct driver, a significant downturn in the EU economy could contribute to broader market risk aversion, potentially weighing on cryptocurrencies. Conversely, robust growth might foster a more optimistic global investment climate. 12:15 UTC: U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (July) – The Private Sector Pulse What it is: The ADP National Employment Report provides an estimate of private-sector employment changes in the U.S. It’s often seen as a precursor to the official Nonfarm Payrolls report. Why it matters: Employment data is a key indicator of economic health and consumer spending power. Strong job growth suggests a robust economy, which can influence the Fed’s monetary policy decisions. Crypto Impact: A surprisingly strong ADP report could signal a tighter labor market, potentially leading the Fed to maintain a hawkish stance, which might be perceived negatively by crypto markets. Conversely, a weak report could suggest economic cooling, potentially prompting a more dovish Fed outlook, which could be seen as positive for risk assets. 12:30 UTC: U.S. GDP (QoQ) (Q2) – The Big Picture of U.S. Growth What it is: This is the first estimate of the U.S. GDP for the second quarter. It’s the broadest measure of economic activity. Why it matters: GDP figures are crucial for assessing the overall health and growth trajectory of the U.S. economy. Consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth are a common, though not sole, indicator of a recession. Crypto Impact: A stronger-than-expected GDP could boost confidence in the U.S. economy, but might also reinforce expectations of continued aggressive monetary policy, potentially creating headwinds for crypto. A weaker GDP, especially if it signals a recession, could lead to significant market volatility, with cryptocurrencies potentially facing selling pressure alongside traditional risk assets, though some might argue for crypto as a safe haven in certain scenarios. 18:00 UTC: U.S. FOMC Statement & Fed Interest Rate Decision – The Apex of Economic Events This is arguably the most anticipated event of the week.

Conversely, a weak report could suggest economic cooling, potentially prompting a more dovish Fed outlook, which could be seen as positive for risk assets. 12:30 UTC: U.S. GDP (QoQ) (Q2) – The Big Picture of U.S. Growth What it is: This is the first estimate of the U.S. GDP for the second quarter. It’s the broadest measure of economic activity. Why it matters: GDP figures are crucial for assessing the overall health and growth trajectory of the U.S. economy. Consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth are a common, though not sole, indicator of a recession. Crypto Impact: A stronger-than-expected GDP could boost confidence in the U.S. economy, but might also reinforce expectations of continued aggressive monetary policy, potentially creating headwinds for crypto. A weaker GDP, especially if it signals a recession, could lead to significant market volatility, with cryptocurrencies potentially facing selling pressure alongside traditional risk assets, though some might argue for crypto as a safe haven in certain scenarios. 18:00 UTC: U.S. FOMC Statement & Fed Interest Rate Decision – The Apex of Economic Events This is arguably the most anticipated event of the week. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets the target range for the federal funds rate, influencing borrowing costs across th"
2025-07-28 00:59:34+00:00,Did El Salvador fake Bitcoin buys to scam the IMF?,"In 2021, El Salvador became the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. President Nayib Bukele said the decision would help the country break free from relying on the US dollar and lower the high costs of sending and receiving money. The government launched the Chivo Wallet, set up Bitcoin ATMs, promised a tax-free “Bitcoin City,” and planned to raise $1b through “Volcano Bonds” to advance its digital agenda . But what stood out the most was the president’s promise to buy one Bitcoin every day starting in November 2022, and for more than two years, his administration claimed it did. On top of that, the government constantly highlighted its commitment to Bitcoin by posting updates about new purchases every week on social media . They used sites like Nayib Tracker to show off the country’s growing reserves and convince everyone that El Salvador wasn’t backing down. Bitcoin circles praised the country for standing up to traditional finance systems and leading the way for other developing nations, while crypto enthusiasts said its boldness was visionary. In reality, El Salvador urgently needed money. The country faced rising debt, a growing budget gap, and increasing pressure to rebuild trust with international lenders. The financial situation was more fragile than it seemed, so the government quietly worked out a $1.4 billion loan deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), agreeing to follow strict conditions to get the support it needed. In July 2025, the IMF review revealed El Salvador hadn’t bought any new Bitcoin since February, just weeks after finalizing the deal. This shocking news raised a big question: Did El Salvador believe in Bitcoin, or was it just putting on a show to get money from the IMF? Officials told one story to the IMF and another to the public El Salvador faced growing debt and economic pressure by late 2024. Its bold Bitcoin experiment grabbed headlines but failed to attract the broad economic relief the government expected. While tourism rose slightly and a few Bitcoin influencers showed interest, issues like rising deficits, weak public trust, stalled projects, and a broken Chivo Wallet remained unresolved. The government had no choice but to turn to the IMF (an organization it once resisted) for help because it urgently needed to secure reliable funding. After months of talks, El Salvador secured a 40-month, $1.4 billion loan from the IMF in December 2024. The deal aimed to stabilize the economy and rebuild trust with global partners and investors, but also came with strict conditions. The country agreed to stop buying more Bitcoin, make its use optional instead of mandatory, limit government control of the Chivo Wallet, and increase transparency in all state-run crypto activities. The government quietly told the IMF it had stopped buying Bitcoin in February 2025 but kept that information from the public. Instead, President Bukele and the National Bitcoin Office kept posting on social media as if they were still buying Bitcoin every day. The new IMF report released in July 2025 revealed that there had been no new public Bitcoin purchases for months. A letter was attached to the review stating that “the stock of Bitcoins held by the public sector remains unchanged.” Worse, it was signed by the country’s central bank president and the finance minister. A small but telling detail in footnote nine revealed that the rise in El Salvador’s Bitcoin reserve came from moving existing Bitcoin between wallets and not from new purchases or market gains. In short, the government was just shifting Bitcoin between its own wallets, rearranging its holdings without adding anything new. The government carefully followed the IMF’s rules to unlock funding and keep creditors happy, while still pretending to the public that it was fully committed to Bitcoin and daily buys. Leaders faked Bitcoin buys to secure a $1.4b loan Did the government knowingly mislead the public about buying Bitcoin, or was it just using a smart strategy to get funding while keeping its crypto image alive? That’s the question at the heart of El Salvador’s Bitcoin saga. It was clear that President Bukele’s team and top financial advisors entered IMF talks knowing the loan required big changes to their digital asset policies. Yet they kept making public claims that told a different story, even after agreeing to the terms and confirming compliance in official documents sent to the IMF in early 2025. The government’s mixed messaging showed a clear strategy: win over both the public and global lenders. It not only cooperated with the IMF, accepted strict conditions, and secured not just the $1.4 billion loan in private, but also got over $2 billion more from the World Bank and IDB. The government faced public pressure to protect its crypto image as it met IMF demands behind the scenes.

Right now, a crucial metric, the Altcoin Season Index , stands at 43 as of 00:30 UTC on July 28. This specific reading from CoinMarketCap (CMC) signals that we are firmly entrenched in what’s known as ‘Bitcoin Season’. But what exactly does this indicator mean for your digital asset portfolio, and how should astute investors navigate these prevailing market currents? What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index, and How Does It Work? To understand current market dynamics, it’s essential to grasp the mechanics behind the Altcoin Season Index . Developed by CoinMarketCap, this index offers a clear snapshot of the broader crypto market’s performance. It compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over a rolling 90-day period. The index’s score indicates whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin (higher score) or if Bitcoin is dominating (lower score). Here’s how different market phases are defined: Index Score Range Market State Definition (vs. Bitcoin over 90 days) 75-100 Altcoin Season At least 75% of top 100 altcoins outperformed Bitcoin. 26-74 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer of top 100 altcoins outperformed Bitcoin. 1-25 Bitcoin Dominance Very few altcoins performing well against Bitcoin. Our current reading of 43 places us firmly in ‘Bitcoin Season’, indicating that the majority of altcoins are struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin’s momentum, and capital is largely flowing into or remaining within Bitcoin. Why Are We Experiencing Bitcoin Season Right Now? Unpacking the Drivers The shift towards Bitcoin Season is influenced by a confluence of macroeconomic factors, market sentiment, and unique cryptocurrency dynamics. Several key drivers contribute to Bitcoin’s current outperformance, pushing the Altcoin Season Index lower: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability or rising interest rates, investors often seek ‘safer’ assets. Bitcoin, increasingly viewed as ‘digital gold’ within crypto, attracts capital away from more speculative altcoins. Institutional Adoption: A significant portion of institutional capital entering crypto initially focuses on Bitcoin. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs, for instance, provides regulated access for large financial entities, creating consistent buying pressure for Bitcoin not always seen in altcoins. Bitcoin Halving Narrative: The anticipation of Bitcoin’s programmed supply shock (halving) often drives accumulation. This strong bullish sentiment for Bitcoin can overshadow altcoin performance in the pre-halving and immediate post-halving periods. Market Liquidity: Bitcoin’s vast market capitalization offers superior liquidity, allowing it to absorb large orders with less volatility. When overall market liquidity tightens, funds often consolidate into Bitcoin. Navigating the Currents: Strategic Approaches for Investors During Bitcoin Season Understanding that we are in Bitcoin Season, as indicated by the Altcoin Season Index at 43, is crucial. Adapting your investment strategy can help you navigate these conditions effectively: Focus on Bitcoin Accumulation: Many investors prioritize accumulating Bitcoin during this period, given its historical resilience and role as the primary gateway for institutional money. Strategic Altcoin Selection: Not all altcoins will suffer equally. This period demands highly selective investment. Look for projects with: Strong Fundamentals: Clear use cases, robust technology, and demonstrable adoption. Active Development: Teams consistently delivering updates and hitting roadmap milestones. Niche Strength: Leadership in high-growth sectors like AI integration, Real World Assets (RWA) tokenization, or Layer 2 scaling solutions. Embrace Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Regularly investing a fixed amount into Bitcoin and selected altcoins, regardless of price, can average out your purchase price over time and mitigate short-term volatility. Prioritize Risk Management: Diversify holdings, set realistic profit targets, and consider stop-loss orders.

Here''s what''s making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk''s Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $119,430 in early Asia hours on Monday, up 1.24%, as bullish momentum continued following a series of institutional milestones and a breakthrough trade deal between the United States and the European Union. The CoinDesk 20 (CD20) Index rose 2.37% to 4,099.18, extending its recent recovery. Over the weekend, President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a framework trade agreement at Turnberry, Scotland, that sets a 15% U.S. import tariff on E.U. goods, avoiding the previously threatened 30% rate. The deal includes $600 billion in E.U. investment in U.S. energy and defense over the next three years and aims to reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian fuel. Tariffs on steel and aluminum remain at 50% for the time being. At the same time, bitcoin’s realized market capitalization, a measure of the total value of BTC based on the last time each coin moved, crossed the $1 trillion threshold for the first time , according to Glassnode. All this comes as BTC continues to consolidate above $118,000 after hitting a record high of $122,700 last week. The rally triggered significant long-term holder selling, while drawing in new buyers and fresh capital. BTC dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market share relative to the total crypto market, has edged down to 60.98%, suggesting modest rotation into altcoins. On Friday, Galaxy Digital announced it had executed a $9 billion BTC transaction on behalf of a Satoshi-era investor, one of the largest single bitcoin transfers in history. The sale involved 80,000 BTC and was reportedly part of an estate planning strategy. The lack of price movement despite the size of the deal is likely a testament to how much BTC is illiquid, thanks to long-term HODLing. A market on the verge of a supply-shock rally can take an extra $9 billion being placed up for sale. Meanwhile, Polymarket bettors now give BTC a 24% chance of hitting $125,000 before the end of July, up from 18% earlier in the week. The increased odds come as traders weigh the impact of macro tailwinds and growing on-chain conviction.

2025-07-28 01:30:48+00:00,"Bitcoin Reaching $200K in 2024 Is “Highly Unlikely,” but Analysts Still Project a 77x Return Opportunity","While hopes for a $200,000 Bitcoin are still echoing across crypto circles, one prominent analyst is pressing pause on the hype. James Check, lead on-chain strategist at Glassnode, argues that while Bitcoin’s long-term path looks bullish, a six-month run to $200K is highly unlikely without a meaningful uptick in trading volume. With Bitcoin’s growth temporarily stalling, investor attention is beginning to shift. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most sought-after altcoins in this transitional phase , rising fast on the back of global expansion and strategic momentum. Volume Gaps Raise Red Flags In an interview on Tuesday, Check raised doubts about Bitcoin’s current trajectory, pointing to a stark lack of volume behind its recent move above $120K. “How on earth can we be going up when there is no volume?” he asked, noting that without deeper liquidity, any major surge would be structurally weak. Bitcoin’s market cap stood around $2.38 trillion at the time—meaning a push to $200K would nearly double that figure. “It’s a big move,” Check said, “and unless there’s a strong foundation of buy pressure, it’s very improbable.” He emphasized the need for BTC to not just cross—but hold—key resistance levels like $130K and $150K . It’s this cautious sentiment around Bitcoin that has quietly fueled renewed interest in altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE . As BTC struggles for short-term footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is charging ahead, powered by an ambitious global marketing campaign that’s bringing in a wave of new participants. Early backers and recent entrants alike are being positioned for exponential reward, as the token’s value continues to rise steadily—hour by hour. Analysts project a potential 77x return as MAGACOIN FINANCE continues its surge , driven by its unique tokenomics, expanding ecosystem, and high-performance market behavior in contrast to Bitcoin’s current slowdown. In a cycle that rewards momentum and clarity of vision, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building one of the most talked-about stories on the altcoin front. Five-Year Outlook Still Positive Despite the near-term doubt, Check’s long-term stance on Bitcoin remains upbeat. He still believes BTC will be “well and truly” above $200,000 in the next five years, particularly as institutional players deepen their exposure and ETF flows scale up. This mirrors predictions from other analysts like Matt Hougan of Bitwise and Bernstein Research, both of whom expect Bitcoin to reach the $200K level by late 2025, driven by tightening supply and increasing institutional demand. Still, not everyone is convinced the window is that wide. Rekt Capital, a popular technical analyst, recently warned that the current expansion phase may be nearing its final months based on prior halving cycle patterns. Conclusion Although Bitcoin’s long-term story remains intact, the odds of a $200K price tag in 2024 are fading without stronger trading activity and structural support. Glassnode’s James Check suggests caution—but not pessimism.

While hopes for a $200,000 Bitcoin are still echoing across crypto circles, one prominent analyst is pressing pause on the hype. James Check, lead on-chain strategist at Glassnode, argues that while Bitcoin’s long-term path looks bullish, a six-month run to $200K is highly unlikely without a meaningful uptick in trading volume. With Bitcoin’s growth temporarily stalling, investor attention is beginning to shift. MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most sought-after altcoins in this transitional phase , rising fast on the back of global expansion and strategic momentum. Volume Gaps Raise Red Flags In an interview on Tuesday, Check raised doubts about Bitcoin’s current trajectory, pointing to a stark lack of volume behind its recent move above $120K. “How on earth can we be going up when there is no volume?” he asked, noting that without deeper liquidity, any major surge would be structurally weak. Bitcoin’s market cap stood around $2.38 trillion at the time—meaning a push to $200K would nearly double that figure. “It’s a big move,” Check said, “and unless there’s a strong foundation of buy pressure, it’s very improbable.” He emphasized the need for BTC to not just cross—but hold—key resistance levels like $130K and $150K . It’s this cautious sentiment around Bitcoin that has quietly fueled renewed interest in altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE . As BTC struggles for short-term footing, MAGACOIN FINANCE is charging ahead, powered by an ambitious global marketing campaign that’s bringing in a wave of new participants. Early backers and recent entrants alike are being positioned for exponential reward, as the token’s value continues to rise steadily—hour by hour. Analysts project a potential 77x return as MAGACOIN FINANCE continues its surge , driven by its unique tokenomics, expanding ecosystem, and high-performance market behavior in contrast to Bitcoin’s current slowdown. In a cycle that rewards momentum and clarity of vision, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building one of the most talked-about stories on the altcoin front. Five-Year Outlook Still Positive Despite the near-term doubt, Check’s long-term stance on Bitcoin remains upbeat. He still believes BTC will be “well and truly” above $200,000 in the next five years, particularly as institutional players deepen their exposure and ETF flows scale up. This mirrors predictions from other analysts like Matt Hougan of Bitwise and Bernstein Research, both of whom expect Bitcoin to reach the $200K level by late 2025, driven by tightening supply and increasing institutional demand. Still, not everyone is convinced the window is that wide. Rekt Capital, a popular technical analyst, recently warned that the current expansion phase may be nearing its final months based on prior halving cycle patterns. Conclusion Although Bitcoin’s long-term story remains intact, the odds of a $200K price tag in 2024 are fading without stronger trading activity and structural support. Glassnode’s James Check suggests caution—but not pessimism.
