During the same period, its total liabilities stood at $157.1 billion, almost all of which correspond to digital tokens in circulation.

Tether''s reliance on US Treasury securities has reached a staggering level. The company holds $105.5 billion in direct US Treasury securities and $21.3 billion in indirect US Treasury securities.

A significant portion of these profits was channeled into strategic investments. Tether continues to channel its growing profitability into long-term projects. Among the investments made in the last six months, projects like XXI Capital, Rumble, and the Rumble Wallet development stand out. The US has received the largest share of these investments, with a total of nearly $4 billion in capital being channeled into the local ecosystem.

2025-07-31 17:30:20+00:00,Bolivia Partners El Salvador to Build a Strong Crypto Future,"Bolivia is entering a new stage in its financial journey by moving toward crypto adoption. On July 30, 2025, Bolivia’s Central Bank (BCB) signed an important agreement with El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets (CNAD). The goal is to collaborate on improving rules for digital assets and developing blockchain technology. This move shows that Bolivia wants a safer and more advanced financial system. A Strategic Partnership to Share Knowledge and Experience The agreement signed between the two countries is called a memorandum of understanding (MoU). This agreement allows both countries to exchange ideas and improve their knowledge of how to regulate and manage digital assets and blockchain technology . The MoU will allow Bolivia and El Salvador to exchange information on crypto laws and regulatory policies. Both countries will join forces to create tools that lower risks and make digital assets safer. They also plan to use blockchain technology to boost transparency and help spot fraud or misuse. The main goal is to build safe, well-regulated systems that support financial progress and new ideas. Learning from El Salvador’s Crypto Journey El Salvador has led the way in using cryptocurrency. In 2021, it became the first country to make Bitcoin (BTC) an official currency, under President Nayib Bukele. The Central American country continues to expand its Bitcoin reserves and has enacted favourable laws to attract crypto companies. This strategy has attracted major investors, including Tether, a prominent stablecoin issuer. Even though financial groups like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have criticized the move, El Salvador has stayed focused on its crypto plans . Now, Bolivia wants to learn from El Salvador’s experience to develop its own digital asset policies. Bolivia’s Policy Change and Growing Interest in Crypto This partnership follows Bolivia’s significant shift from strict crypto rules to a more open approach. In June 2024, the government passed Resolution 082/2024, which ended the long-term ban on digital assets. The new law allows crypto trading and digital payments under clear regulations. Since that change, Bolivia has seen a sharp rise in crypto use. In June 2024, crypto transactions were worth around $46.5 million. A year later, the value had grown to nearly $294 million. This shows that people and businesses in Bolivia are quickly adopting digital assets now that they are legal. Bolivia has also started to use crypto for trade. The government has allowed the national oil company, YPFB, to use digital currencies when buying fuel from other countries. This is especially important because Bolivia has been facing problems with foreign currency shortages. This move shows how serious the country is about including crypto in its national economy.

2025-07-31 18:00:03+00:00,Best Crypto Casino Rewards in 2025: Why Spartans is Better than Stake.com & LeoVegas,"For anyone exploring online betting for the first time, welcome bonuses can be a big deal. Many platforms lead with bold offers and big numbers, but once you look closer, things often get complicated. High wagering rules, limited currencies, and restrictions can turn a promising deal into a letdown. This article takes a close look at three major platforms, Stake.com, LeoVegas, and Spartans , to find out who really delivers the most worthwhile crypto casino rewards in 2025. From bonus terms to actual usability, here’s what players need to know before picking a platform. Stake.com: High Bonus Offers With Heavy Strings Attached Stake.com definitely knows how to get attention. Its welcome bonuses are hard to miss, with flashy percentages and promises of major returns. But if you dig into the details, the catch becomes clear. There are significant wagering requirements, meaning players must bet the bonus several times before they’re allowed to cash out anything. These conditions vary based on game type, which only adds to the confusion. For many players, especially those new to the platform, this makes the bonus feel more like an obstacle. While Stake.com looks great on the surface, its crypto casino rewards lose their appeal once the fine print comes into play. LeoVegas: Personalized Bonuses With Limited Crypto Support LeoVegas tries to set itself apart with a personalized approach. It lets users choose from various bonus types depending on the games they prefer, which sounds convenient at first. But there’s a downside, especially for those using cryptocurrencies. Many of LeoVegas’ bonuses are tied to specific fiat currencies. If you’re depositing in crypto, or even just outside popular regions, you may find you’re not eligible or your options are limited. That makes things tricky for users hoping for seamless crypto casino rewards. It might be a solid pick for EUR or GBP players, but it doesn’t quite work as well for crypto-first users. Spartans: Honest Bonus Terms With Full Crypto Compatibility Spartans takes a much simpler route, and that’s where it shines. The welcome offer here is straightforward: a 300% match bonus up to $200 with a low $5 minimum deposit. What makes it different is the clear, upfront information. There’s a 35x wagering requirement for casino and 10x for sports, and all conditions are spelled out plainly. Crypto deposits are fully accepted without any conversion problems, and the bonus funds arrive fast. Plus, there’s a 10x cap on bonus withdrawals, so players know from the start what to expect. This transparency makes Spartans stand out as a top choice for players who want real crypto casino rewards without having to decode complicated rules. Clear Value Beats Flashy Promises This isn’t just about the biggest numbers, it’s about how easy those bonuses are to use. Stake.com leans heavily on flashy offers but makes players jump through too many hoops. LeoVegas looks flexible but falls short when it comes to crypto accessibility. Spartans does the opposite. It offers a simple match, fast access to funds, and conditions that anyone can understand. That’s exactly what most players want, clarity, not complexity. For those focused on getting the most out of their crypto casino rewards, Spartans clearly puts users first. Crypto Bonuses That Work the Same for Everyone Another area where Spartans gets it right is crypto support. While Stake.com and LeoVegas offer crypto options, the experience isn’t always smooth. You might face different interfaces, restrictions on certain promotions, or bonus terms that change based on your token. Spartans eliminates that confusion. Whether you’re using Bitcoin, USDT, or other supported currencies, the bonus remains the same. There are no surprise fees or exclusions. For players who prefer betting exclusively with crypto, this kind of consistency makes Spartans one of the few platforms where crypto casino rewards work exactly as expected. Final Thoughts Players shouldn’t have to crunch numbers just to figure out if a bonus is worth it. In 2025, users want simple value and clear rules, not a long list of exceptions. While Stake.com and LeoVegas each have strengths, their bonus structures often create more hassle than help. Spartans flips that script. From your first deposit, you get straightforward terms, reliable crypto support, and bonuses that are easy to use. In a space where many offers sound better than they are, Spartans delivers what it promises: crypto casino rewards that actually make sense. And in the long run, that’s what really matters.

It lets users choose from various bonus types depending on the games they prefer, which sounds convenient at first. But there’s a downside, especially for those using cryptocurrencies. Many of LeoVegas’ bonuses are tied to specific fiat currencies. If you’re depositing in crypto, or even just outside popular regions, you may find you’re not eligible or your options are limited. That makes things tricky for users hoping for seamless crypto casino rewards. It might be a solid pick for EUR or GBP players, but it doesn’t quite work as well for crypto-first users. Spartans: Honest Bonus Terms With Full Crypto Compatibility Spartans takes a much simpler route, and that’s where it shines. The welcome offer here is straightforward: a 300% match bonus up to $200 with a low $5 minimum deposit. What makes it different is the clear, upfront information. There’s a 35x wagering requirement for casino and 10x for sports, and all conditions are spelled out plainly. Crypto deposits are fully accepted without any conversion problems, and the bonus funds arrive fast. Plus, there’s a 10x cap on bonus withdrawals, so players know from the start what to expect. This transparency makes Spartans stand out as a top choice for players who want real crypto casino rewards without having to decode complicated rules. Clear Value Beats Flashy Promises This isn’t just about the biggest numbers, it’s about how easy those bonuses are to use. Stake.com leans heavily on flashy offers but makes players jump through too many hoops. LeoVegas looks flexible but falls short when it comes to crypto accessibility. Spartans does the opposite. It offers a simple match, fast access to funds, and conditions that anyone can understand. That’s exactly what most players want, clarity, not complexity. For those focused on getting the most out of their crypto casino rewards, Spartans clearly puts users first. Crypto Bonuses That Work the Same for Everyone Another area where Spartans gets it right is crypto support. While Stake.com and LeoVegas offer crypto options, the experience isn’t always smooth. You might face different interfaces, restrictions on certain promotions, or bonus terms that change based on your token. Spartans eliminates that confusion. Whether you’re using Bitcoin, USDT, or other supported currencies, the bonus remains the same. There are no surprise fees or exclusions. For players who prefer betting exclusively with crypto, this kind of consistency makes Spartans one of the few platforms where crypto casino rewards work exactly as expected. Final Thoughts Players shouldn’t have to crunch numbers just to figure out if a bonus is worth it. In 2025, users want simple value and clear rules, not a long list of exceptions. While Stake.com and LeoVegas each have strengths, their bonus structures often create more hassle than help. Spartans flips that script. From your first deposit, you get straightforward terms, reliable crypto support, and bonuses that are easy to use. In a space where many offers sound better than they are, Spartans delivers what it promises: crypto casino rewards that actually make sense. And in the long run, that’s what really matters.

Ripple’s lead tech officer stressed that XRP remains the primary bridge asset in cross-border transactions—and that wider use of the XRP Ledger will keep boosting the altcoin’s utility and value.

That role helps institutions send funds quickly and cheaply, even when market swings might make a stablecoin less ideal. Ripple launched RLUSD in December 2024 to meet demand for price stability. According to Schwartz, stablecoins like RLUSD make sense in use cases that depend on a fixed value—such as when firms use crypto assets as collateral or enter and exit markets without risking 5% swings overnight. He noted that Hidden Road, one of Ripple’s big partners that works with over 300 institutions, chose RLUSD as its main collateral asset in May 2025. That move shows RLUSD’s appeal for stability-focused tasks. Stablecoin Role Versus Altcoin Utility Schwartz drew a clear line between the two tokens. For tasks where price predictability matters most, a stablecoin helps avoid hiccups. But for the majority of payments, he believes a liquid asset like XRP does a better job—unless someone wants to avoid risk entirely. Holding major digital assets can capture upside, and XRP fits that need better than cash, he said. Adoption Drives XRP Demand Looking ahead, Schwartz stressed that real-world use of the XRP Ledger will naturally drive more demand for the crypto. As more projects and institutions tap into XRPL’s fast transaction speeds and low fees, they’ll need XRP to power each move. That design makes it harder to sidestep the coin’s native token than it is on other networks, where developers can wrap or bypass the base coin entirely. Schwartz’s remarks arrive amid community worries that XRP is being sidelined in favor of stablecoins. The choice by Hidden Road to back RLUSD raised eyebrows back in May 2025. Related Reading: Don’t Blink: 1,000 XRP Could Be The Best Move You’ve Made—Expert XRP’s Use Case But by highlighting how deeply XRP is woven into XRPL’s mechanics—and reminding investors that the altcoin’s volume still outstrips any other asset in Ripple Payments—Schwartz sent a clear message: XRP’s use won’t fade, even as stablecoins gain ground. Based on these comments, Ripple appears to be taking a two-pronged approach: use RLUSD where price stability is critical, and rely on XRP for its proven liquidity and built-in role on the ledger.

In a new thread, crypto trader Ali Martinez tells his 145,200 followers on the social media platform X that, based on the short-term holder (STH) cost basis model, Bitcoin may increase more than 19% from its current value. The STH cost basis model is an on-chain metric that estimates the average price at which short-term Bitcoin holders acquired their coins. The metric can be used to spot potential entry and exit points. “As long as the $105,450 support holds, Bitcoin could be on track for a move to $125,230 and potentially $141,770, based on the short-term holder cost basis.” Source: Ali Martinez/X The analyst also uses the cumulative value-days destroyed (CVDD) metric, which looks at the value of each Bitcoin transaction while giving weight to the number of days since the coins were last moved. The CVDD is used to spot potential market tops and bottoms. “The next Bitcoin top could be at $149,679!” Source: Ali Martinez/X Bitcoin is trading for $118,250 at time of writing, up marginally in the last 24 hours.

2025-07-31 18:10:12+00:00,Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses: Unveiling the Alarming Drop,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses: Unveiling the Alarming Drop In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, keeping an eye on fundamental metrics is crucial for understanding market health. Recently, a significant shift has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike: a noticeable decline in Bitcoin daily active addresses . What does this intriguing development signify for the world’s leading cryptocurrency? Is it a fleeting blip or a signal of deeper underlying trends? What Exactly Happened to Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses? According to data shared by Santiment on X (formerly Twitter), the landscape of Bitcoin’s on-chain activity saw a considerable change throughout July. Specifically: In early July, Bitcoin daily active addresses were robust, ranging between 570,000 and 800,000, indicating healthy user engagement. By July 31st, this number sharply declined to approximately 380,000, a significant contraction in unique addresses participating in transactions. In contrast, Ethereum demonstrated remarkable stability during the same period, maintaining around 511,000 active addresses, offering a compelling point of comparison. This divergence highlights distinct user behaviors and network priorities, prompting a deeper dive into what drives such fluctuations. Why Do Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses Matter? Understanding Network Health When we talk about Bitcoin daily active addresses , we refer to the unique blockchain addresses active as either a sender or receiver on a given day. This metric is a vital indicator of a cryptocurrency network’s health and utility: Organic Adoption & Utility: High active addresses suggest genuine adoption, implying more people use Bitcoin for transactions, not just holding. Network Demand: Increased activity can correlate with higher demand for block space and transaction fees. User Engagement: Reflects community engagement; a vibrant network signifies a healthy, growing ecosystem. Market Sentiment: A sustained decline can precede or coincide with waning investor interest and bearish sentiment, while an increase signals renewed interest. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for assessing Bitcoin’s fundamental strength beyond just its price chart. Decoding the Drop: Potential Factors Behind the Decline in Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses A significant drop in Bitcoin daily active addresses is rarely due to a single cause, but rather a confluence of market sentiment, technological shifts, and broader economic conditions. Potential reasons include: Bear Market Fatigue: Prolonged bear markets lead to “hodler” behavior, reducing daily on-chain transactions as users wait out downturns. Speculative activity also wanes. Consolidation of Holdings: Large holders may consolidate Bitcoin across fewer addresses, especially when moving to secure, custodial solutions. Shift to Layer-2 Solutions: As networks like the Lightning Network mature, more transactions occur off the main blockchain, not reflected in base-layer active addresses. Exchange Activity & User Onboarding: Changes in exchange wallet management, rebalancing, or reduced high-frequency trading can impact numbers. Fewer new users or less active existing users also contribute. Seasonal & Macro Factors: Crypto markets experience seasonal dips. Broader macroeconomic concerns, regulatory uncertainty, or lack of positive news can slow network engagement. Consider these factors holistically rather than jumping to conclusions based on a single metric. How Does Ethereum’s Stability Contrast with Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses? The resilience of Ethereum’s active addresses, maintaining around 511,000 while Bitcoin daily active addresses saw a steep decline, provides a compelling contrast. This divergence can be attributed to several key differences in their ecosystems and primary use cases: Diverse Ecosystem & Utility: Ethereum’s strength lies in its robust dApp ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, Web3), driving consistent transaction volume. Bitcoin primarily serves as a store of value. Smart Contract Functionality: Ethereum’s smart contracts allow complex interactions beyond simple transfers (lending, staking, gaming), boosting active address counts. Developer Activity: High developer activity on Ethereum leads to continuous innovation, attracting and retaining users. Staking & DeFi Participation: Ethereum 2.0 and liquid staking incentivize long-term holding and DeFi participation, contributing to a stable user base. This comparison shows that while both are leading cryptocurrencies, their utility and user engagement models lead to different on-chain behavior during market fluctuations.

2025-07-31 18:12:58+00:00,Jito Labs leads SEC petition to approve Solana liquid staking tokens for ETPs,"The leading validator and block builder, Jito Labs, led a petition to the SEC to approve Solana liquid staking tokens for exchange-traded products (ETP) and ETFs. The filing starts a new stage of using crypto in traditional finance, allowing in-kind compensation and passive income. Jito Labs , along with Bitwise, Multicoin, VanEck, and Solana Institute, filed a petition to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow the usage of Solana liquid staking tokens in ETF and ETP. JUST IN: Jito Labs, Bitwise, Multicoin, VanEck, and Solana Institute urge the SEC to approve Liquid Staking Tokens in ETPs. They say LSTs boost liquidity, resilience, and cut risk, pushing for greenlight in upcoming Solana ETFs under new SEC rules. pic.twitter.com/XdAixF7XqB — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) July 31, 2025 The organizations are advocating for the usage of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) as the main type of staking in ETP or ETF. Solana allows for regular SOL staking, but there is also liquid staking, which includes both passive income and a newly issued token for additional operations. The filing urged to include liquid staking for eight products that filed S-1 forms with the SEC on June 13, 2025. Jito Labs urges the spread of liquid staking tokens to ETP and possibly ETF For now, only ETPs allow for staking, but the practice may spread to ETFs with additional requests. The SEC is also still exploring the legal side of staking , for both Ethereum and Solana ETFs, while fund issuers are pushing to include various forms of staking and in-kind compensation. Jito Labs and its associates claimed LSTs are capital-efficient and low-risk, and can benefit ETP investors. So far, the SEC has not explicitly addressed LSTs on Solana or other networks, though there are general guidelines on proof-of-stake networks. LSTs can work as a proxy for direct staking, and the SEC is urged to consider the mechanism for Solana and other chains. LSTs are most common on Ethereum and Solana, and are a tool to secure the network, while also putting idle tokens to work. Requests for staking started in 2024 The initial ETF and ETP filings omitted the issue of staking, as they focused on BTC products. The inclusion of Ethereum and later Solana ETP filings raised the issue of staking. The first filings avoided the topic due to technical uncertainties, taxation issues, and the fear of pushing crypto innovation too quickly to mainstream investors. Currently, Solana carries over $7.8B in value through its liquid staking tokens. Most of the tokens are issued by validators or other infrastructure projects on the Solana chain, among which JitoSOL is the leader. One of the risks for LSTs is their relative volatility. While SOL traded at $177.75, LSTs ranged between $220 and $200. Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL) traded at $218.57. Marinade’s token traded as high as $235.06. LSTs are often used in DeFi protocols and have varying price discovery mechanisms. There is no clear standard for staking service, and each has relatively complex rules. The biggest risk for LSTs is ‘slashing’, where flawed validators can have their tokens confiscated. Therefore, some LST issuers are competing to offer safe or vetted services.

The leading validator and block builder, Jito Labs, led a petition to the SEC to approve Solana liquid staking tokens for exchange-traded products (ETP) and ETFs. The filing starts a new stage of using crypto in traditional finance, allowing in-kind compensation and passive income. Jito Labs , along with Bitwise, Multicoin, VanEck, and Solana Institute, filed a petition to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow the usage of Solana liquid staking tokens in ETF and ETP. JUST IN: Jito Labs, Bitwise, Multicoin, VanEck, and Solana Institute urge the SEC to approve Liquid Staking Tokens in ETPs. They say LSTs boost liquidity, resilience, and cut risk, pushing for greenlight in upcoming Solana ETFs under new SEC rules. pic.twitter.com/XdAixF7XqB — Cryptopolitan (@CPOfficialtx) July 31, 2025 The organizations are advocating for the usage of liquid staking tokens (LSTs) as the main type of staking in ETP or ETF. Solana allows for regular SOL staking, but there is also liquid staking, which includes both passive income and a newly issued token for additional operations. The filing urged to include liquid staking for eight products that filed S-1 forms with the SEC on June 13, 2025. Jito Labs urges the spread of liquid staking tokens to ETP and possibly ETF For now, only ETPs allow for staking, but the practice may spread to ETFs with additional requests. The SEC is also still exploring the legal side of staking , for both Ethereum and Solana ETFs, while fund issuers are pushing to include various forms of staking and in-kind compensation. Jito Labs and its associates claimed LSTs are capital-efficient and low-risk, and can benefit ETP investors. So far, the SEC has not explicitly addressed LSTs on Solana or other networks, though there are general guidelines on proof-of-stake networks. LSTs can work as a proxy for direct staking, and the SEC is urged to consider the mechanism for Solana and other chains. LSTs are most common on Ethereum and Solana, and are a tool to secure the network, while also putting idle tokens to work. Requests for staking started in 2024 The initial ETF and ETP filings omitted the issue of staking, as they focused on BTC products. The inclusion of Ethereum and later Solana ETP filings raised the issue of staking. The first filings avoided the topic due to technical uncertainties, taxation issues, and the fear of pushing crypto innovation too quickly to mainstream investors. Currently, Solana carries over $7.8B in value through its liquid staking tokens. Most of the tokens are issued by validators or other infrastructure projects on the Solana chain, among which JitoSOL is the leader. One of the risks for LSTs is their relative volatility. While SOL traded at $177.75, LSTs ranged between $220 and $200. Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL) traded at $218.57. Marinade’s token traded as high as $235.06. LSTs are often used in DeFi protocols and have varying price discovery mechanisms. There is no clear standard for staking service, and each has relatively complex rules. The biggest risk for LSTs is ‘slashing’, where flawed validators can have their tokens confiscated. Therefore, some LST issuers are competing to offer safe or vetted services. Recently, Marinade Finance slashed and restaked 340,000 SOL, removing validators from its list. The process is not entirely detailed to mainstream finance regulators, and the SEC will have to research the conditions of staking and slashing. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The two exchanges, Upbit holding the position as Korea’s dominant crypto platform and Bithumb ranking second, collectively control the majority of the nation’s digital asset trading volume. According to a July 30 local report , the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) convened meetings with executives from Korea’s five leading cryptocurrency exchanges to address these new financial products and voice regulatory concerns regarding leverage-associated risks and potential deficiencies in investor protection frameworks. Regulators have expressed concerns over high-risk lending products from Upbit and Bithumb, prompting a push for industry self-regulation. https://t.co/Tv1hXouWRi — Regulation Asia (@RegulationAsia) July 31, 2025 Growing Regulatory Compliance for Crypto Lending and Margin Trading Services Bithumb initiated its cryptocurrency lending service on July 4, allowing users to borrow digital assets using their existing cryptocurrency holdings or Korean won as security, offering leverage ratios up to 4:1. The service encompasses 10 digital currencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Tether. Coinciding with Bithumb’s launch, Upbit rolled out a comparable lending platform supporting three cryptocurrencies: Tether, Bitcoin, and Ripple. The platform is similarly collateralized by crypto assets or traditional currency deposits. These platforms allow traders to borrow cryptocurrencies they don’t possess and execute short sales , generating profits when asset values decline, essentially creating short-selling mechanisms within the virtual asset marketplace. Financial authorities have expressed strong concern that these exchanges may be contravening Korea’s Lending Business Act through their high-risk operations. They particularly pointed out Bithumb’s 4:1 leverage ratio, which surpasses the 2:1 leverage limitation established for Korea’s traditional equity markets. Ki Young Ju, a Seoul-based crypto investor and founder of CryptoQuant, has also noted the dangerous nature of excessive margin trading, particularly when leverage exceeds 4:1 ratio. In a recent social media post, Ju emphasized that utilizing leverage above 5:1 exponentially increases the probability of liquidation within a 24-hour period, noting: “Bitcoin moved more than 2% on most days (82%) this month. If you play 50x Russian roulette every day, the chance of surviving a week is only 0.000612%.” Regulators have expressed concerns over high-risk lending products from Upbit and Bithumb, prompting a push for industry self-regulation. https://t.co/Tv1hXouWRi — Regulation Asia (@RegulationAsia) July 31, 2025 Following regulatory pressure, Upbit discontinued its Tether lending service, citing concerns that providing stablecoin lending in exchange for fees could be construed as consumer lending activity, potentially subjecting the platform to Korea’s lending regulations.

The exchange has temporarily suspended new lending applications due to an exhausted lending inventory. The FSC and FSS are planning to establish an industry collaborative task force to develop voluntary self-regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrency lending and margin trading operations.

2025-07-31 18:15:50+00:00,US SEC unveils sweeping plans to regulate crypto: here’s what you need to know,"The SEC is gearing up to overhaul how it handles crypto, in what could be a major shift for the digital asset world. Speaking on Thursday, SEC Chair Paul Atkins said he’s asked agency staff to begin drafting rules that offer more tailored oversight for crypto markets. That includes clearer definitions around when a token should be treated as a security, along with new disclosure requirements and possible exemptions built specifically for digital assets. For an industry that’s spent years in regulatory limbo, the move is being seen as a big win. Crypto firms and investors have long pushed for a rulebook that reflects the realities of blockchain-based trading, rather than forcing digital assets into frameworks built for traditional finance. The SEC’s initiative suggests Washington may finally be ready to meet them halfway. Crypto enters financial mainstream The SEC’s shift is part of a wider effort across the federal government to bring crypto into the fold of traditional finance, without turning a blind eye to the risks. The SEC has spent the past few years making headlines for chasing down sketchy token sales and classic pump-and-dump scams. But now, the agency’s trying to get ahead of the curve. Instead of just playing defense, it’s working to build a more forward-looking regulatory playbook that sets clear expectations before trouble starts. Early outlines suggest a wide net: rules for registering exchanges and tokens, safeguards against fraud and price manipulation, stronger investor protections, and updated cybersecurity standards tailored to the quirks of blockchain tech. It’s a shift in tone and a sign the SEC wants to rein in the chaos without shutting the door on innovation. And the SEC isn’t alone. Other arms of the federal government have also started to take crypto more seriously in 2025. In a striking move, the Federal Housing Finance Agency has told Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare for a future where borrowers can include certain crypto assets held on US-regulated exchanges, as part of their mortgage applications, without needing to sell them off. It’s a sign that digital assets are slowly but surely being woven into the fabric of the US financial system. A turning point for crypto What’s being dubbed “Crypto Week” on Capitol Hill has delivered real movement for the digital asset space, with major legislation like the GENIUS Act now officially signed into law. After years of regulatory gray zones and mixed signals, lawmakers are finally moving toward a unified federal framework for crypto. The goal: give investors protection without choking off innovation. The White House and SEC are both on board, pushing not just to update securities laws but also to let crypto platforms handle custody and to craft disclosure rules that reflect how digital assets actually function. At its core, the goal is to lay down a regulatory foundation that’s clear and consistent—something the market’s been missing for years. It’s about giving investors more confidence while giving the industry space to grow responsibly. This latest push builds on a 2025 executive order and a working group report released just days before the SEC’s announcement, both of which called on Congress and regulators to move quickly on everything from tax treatment to capital markets oversight for digital assets.

According to a securities filing made public on Tuesday, Eric Trump is set to become one of the wealthiest individuals in the crypto industry following a merger between Gryphon Digital Mining and American Bitcoin Corp. , which he cofounded. Eric Trump’s Bitcoin stake could be worth $367M Eric Trump’s interest in a fledgling Bitcoin mining company may soon make him one of the wealthiest individuals in the U.S. crypto sector. According to a securities filing made public on Tuesday, Eric Trump, the second son of President Donald Trump, is set to receive 367 million shares in Gryphon Digital Mining Inc. as part of a merger between the publicly traded firm and American Bitcoin Corp., a company he co-founded in March. Gryphon shares were trading at roughly $1 on Thursday, which implies that the future value of Trump’s stake under current market conditions is a whopping $367M. President Trump has thrown the weight of the POTUS office behind cryptocurrencies, a sharp pivot from his first term when he was an unrelenting skeptic of the industry. In June, the president signed an executive order aimed at building a national Bitcoin reserve , and this week, he publicly advocated for ushering in what he called a “golden age of crypto” in the United States. Eric Trump is serving as the chief strategy officer for American Bitcoin, a role that carries a three-year advisory agreement but does not include financial compensation, according to the filing. He remains an executive within the Trump Organization and is involved in various family-owned ventures. The Trump family has stakes in the cryptocurrency industry A recent private sale of American Bitcoin shares pegged the value of the new stock at just 25 cents apiece, which would bring Trump’s stake down to approximately $92M. The filing did not disclose what Eric Trump or his brother, Donald Trump Jr., paid for their initial investments. American Bitcoin Corp. was created by merging the mining equipment of the Miami-based Hut 8 Corp. with a new corporate entity backed by the Trump sons and other unnamed investors. In a statement following the merger’s announcement, Hut 8 emphasized that the deal would combine its established mining operations with “Eric Trump’s commercial acumen, capital markets expertise, and commitment to the advancement of decentralized financial systems.” The newly merged company, which will retain the American Bitcoin name, is expected to go public in the coming weeks.

The challenge draws attention to concerns about the long-term resilience of current cryptographic standards, which experts believe could be compromised by advances in quantum computing over the next two decades. Bounty Structure — factual, but suggest slight adjustment to punctuation: $50,000 for breaking secp256k1 (Bitcoin and Ethereum) $30,000 for breaking Ed25519 (Signal, WhatsApp, Solana) $20,000 for breaking NIST P-256 (TLS/SSL, Internet security) $10,000 for other major curves (P-224, P-384, P-521) ""This isn''t about attacking cryptocurrency, it''s about defending it,"" said David Carvalho, CEO of Naoris Protocol. ""These curves are mathematical masterpieces that have protected global commerce for decades. But quantum computing will render them obsolete. We''re building the quantum-safe infrastructure the world needs before that day arrives."" What''s at Stake Elliptic curve cryptography is a foundational element in securing a wide range of digital systems, including financial services, blockchain networks, intellectual property protection, and secure communications. It is widely used in: Global banking and asset management systems Cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum Encrypted messaging platforms and secure web protocols (TLS/SSL) Government and defense communications As these cryptographic standards face potential future threats from quantum computing, testing their resilience has become a growing focus for both public and private sector stakeholders. The Challenge Participants must demonstrate the ability to recover a full private key from a public key using mathematical cryptanalysis. Implementation flaws, side-channel attacks, or weak random number generators don''t qualify; this is about breaking the math itself. Submissions can be made at: BountyForm ""When quantum computers achieve this in the next decade or two, it won''t be a drill,"" Carvalho warned. ""That''s why forward-thinking enterprises and governments are transitioning to post-quantum cryptography now."" Racing Against Time Current quantum computers have approximately 1,000 physical qubits. Breaking 256-bit elliptic curve cryptography requires an estimated 2,330 logical qubits. Although that gap may seem large, quantum computing is advancing at an exponential rate. ""The NSA announced in 2015 they''re transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography,"" noted Carvalho. ""When the world''s premier cryptographic authority moves, smart organizations follow.""

2025-07-31 18:30:32+00:00,Profit-Taking Peaks Again – Is the Next Crypto Rally About to Begin?,"Bitcoin has just completed its third major wave of profit-taking in the ongoing 2023–2025 bull cycle, according to the latest report by CryptoQuant . Bitcoin just saw its third major profit-taking wave of this bull run. Realized profits spiked to $6–8B in late July, on par with March and Dec 2024 peaks. It was new whales who led the selling above $120K. pic.twitter.com/Q4FQkLXcin — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 31, 2025 While each wave has marked a cooling-off period for prices, the pattern also suggests the potential for another upward breakout once the market consolidates and recalibrates. On-chain data, investor behavior, and exchange flows all point to a classic “profit, pause, push” sequence now underway. ETF Launches, Trump Rally, Whale Exit: The Three Waves The first profit-taking wave hit in March 2024, triggered by the approval of U.S.-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs. The hype around this milestone drove prices toward $70,000, prompting early holders to lock in gains. A second wave followed from December 2024 to February 2025, as Bitcoin rallied beyond $100,000 after Donald Trump’s re-election victory, again triggering widespread selling. The third and most recent wave arrived in late July 2025, when Bitcoin surged past $120,000. This wave was punctuated by the sale of 80,000 BTC by an OG whale on July 25—a clear indicator of profit realization at the top. In each case, the market experienced temporary cooling, with consolidation phases lasting between two and four months before resuming the broader uptrend, reports CryptoQuant. On-Chain Metrics Confirm Another Peak CryptoQuant data shows that realized profits among Bitcoin holders spiked to $6–8 billion in late July, levels comparable to the previous waves. The majority of selling came from “new whales”—investors who accumulated BTC in the last 155 days—who cashed out as prices hit new highs. The Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for short-term holders climbed above 1.05, indicating that coins were being sold at a 5% profit. Long-term holders showed SOPR spikes representing nearly 4x returns. These indicators closely mirror patterns observed during previous high-profit periods. Capital Rotation and Exchange Flows Indicate Risk-Off Shift Profit-taking wasn’t limited to Bitcoin. Whales holding USDT, USDC, and WBTC on Ethereum also realized sizable gains, with some days in July seeing $40 million in profits across stablecoins. Meanwhile, exchange inflow data confirmed that more BTC—as much as 70,000 coins in a single day—was moved to exchanges, mirroring peaks in past profit waves. Rising inflows of altcoins reinforced the broader “risk-off” tone in the market. The Path Forward: Consolidation, Then Breakout? If history repeats, Bitcoin and Ethereum are likely to enter a short-term consolidation phase before the next leg up. Previous cycles suggest that strong profit-taking is often followed by a healthy pause, not a prolonged decline. U.S. investor appetite has slightly weakened, as indicated by the Coinbase premium turning negative, but this, too, may be temporary. As the market cools and capital rotates, traders and long-term investors alike will be watching closely. The data suggests that while a pause is in motion, the next push higher may only be a few months away. Federal Reserve Keeps Rates at 4.25%-4.5% The Federal Reserve mai ntained interest rates at 4.25%-4.5% on July 30, marking the fifth consecutive meeting without change, while two governors dissented in favor of cuts for the first time since 1993. The decision triggered a market sell-off with the Dow fall ing over 300 points and cryptocurrency markets experiencing widespread declines before recovering key support levels. Earlier, cryptocurrency markets quickly recovered with Bitcoin defending the key $118,000 level and the global crypto market cap stabilizing above $3.8 trillion.

2025-07-31 18:48:08+00:00,"Binance’s Spot Trading Volume Rises Rapidly Again: According to Analysts, This Signals Something","Joao Wedson, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm Alphractal, highlighted a striking development in the Bitcoin spot market. According to Wedson, Binance has been moving back towards market leadership in terms of spot trading volume in recent weeks. According to Alphactal data, Binance''s share, which accounted for approximately 40% of the Bitcoin spot market volume in April 2025, has now approached 45%. This suggests that Binance is on track to surpass the combined volume of all other exchanges. Wedson reminds us that this kind of volume concentration has been observed in previous cycles: “Historically, when Binance has achieved leadership in spot volume, significant increases in Bitcoin prices have followed. This typically signals the entry of institutional investors seeking more efficient trading with increased liquidity, deeper order books, and lower slippage rates.” Related News: BREAKING: Unexpected Move from SEC - They Announced an Initiative Called “Project Crypto” Wedson also noted a significant shift in the Spot Volume Delta data between Binance and other exchanges. After months of negative net flows, Binance has begun to experience positive inflows again. Percentage distribution charts show Binance reaching its highest dominance in spot volume since the end of 2023. However, Wedson cautions that despite this rise, total spot volume is still below the peaks of late 2024 and early 2025. “This resurgence of Binance could lead to a re-centralization of liquidity and more efficient price discovery.

Joao Wedson, CEO of cryptocurrency analysis firm Alphractal, highlighted a striking development in the Bitcoin spot market. According to Wedson, Binance has been moving back towards market leadership in terms of spot trading volume in recent weeks. According to Alphactal data, Binance''s share, which accounted for approximately 40% of the Bitcoin spot market volume in April 2025, has now approached 45%. This suggests that Binance is on track to surpass the combined volume of all other exchanges. Wedson reminds us that this kind of volume concentration has been observed in previous cycles: “Historically, when Binance has achieved leadership in spot volume, significant increases in Bitcoin prices have followed. This typically signals the entry of institutional investors seeking more efficient trading with increased liquidity, deeper order books, and lower slippage rates.” Related News: BREAKING: Unexpected Move from SEC - They Announced an Initiative Called “Project Crypto” Wedson also noted a significant shift in the Spot Volume Delta data between Binance and other exchanges. After months of negative net flows, Binance has begun to experience positive inflows again. Percentage distribution charts show Binance reaching its highest dominance in spot volume since the end of 2023. However, Wedson cautions that despite this rise, total spot volume is still below the peaks of late 2024 and early 2025. “This resurgence of Binance could lead to a re-centralization of liquidity and more efficient price discovery. Historically, such consolidations often precede phases of market expansion,” Wedson said, adding that there is still significant growth potential for institutional and individual investors. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-31 18:55:11+00:00,"Unveiling the Significant Bitcoin Transfer: 3,650 BTC Moves from Kraken","BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Significant Bitcoin Transfer: 3,650 BTC Moves from Kraken In the ever-pulsating world of cryptocurrency, moments of significant activity often capture the market’s collective gaze. One such event recently sent ripples through the digital asset community: a colossal Bitcoin transfer . Imagine hundreds of millions of dollars in digital currency, moving from a well-known exchange to an undisclosed destination. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a headline-grabbing event that prompts questions, speculation, and deep dives into the mechanics of the crypto ecosystem. For anyone invested in or simply curious about Bitcoin, understanding such movements is paramount. What Exactly Happened with This Bitcoin Transfer ? The crypto monitoring service Whale Alert recently flagged a massive transaction that immediately drew attention. A staggering 3,650 BTC, equivalent to approximately $430 million at the time of the transfer, moved from the Kraken exchange to an unknown wallet. This isn’t the first time such a large sum has shifted, but each instance reignites discussions about market dynamics, security, and the enigmatic figures behind these monumental movements. Here’s a quick breakdown of the reported event: Asset Transferred: 3,650 BTC (Bitcoin) Origin: Kraken Exchange Destination: An ‘unknown’ wallet address Approximate Value: $430,000,000 USD Reported By: Whale Alert While the amount is undeniably large, it’s crucial to understand that a transfer from an exchange like Kraken doesn’t necessarily imply the exchange itself is the sender. More often than not, it signifies a large client withdrawal or an internal movement by the exchange for operational purposes, such as consolidating funds or moving assets into cold storage for enhanced security. Why Do These Massive Bitcoin Transfers Captivate the Market? Large Bitcoin transfers , especially those involving ‘unknown’ wallets, are closely watched for several reasons. They are often perceived as indicators of potential market shifts, institutional interest, or even significant strategic moves by major players. These movements can trigger a range of reactions, from cautious optimism to widespread speculation. The fascination stems from their potential impact on: Market Volatility: A large influx or outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges can signal impending buy or sell pressure, potentially leading to price fluctuations. Investor Sentiment: Such transfers can influence the overall mood of the market. If perceived as a move towards selling, it might induce fear; if seen as accumulation, it could foster bullish sentiment. Institutional Activity: Often, large transfers are linked to institutional investors, hedge funds, or high-net-worth individuals making significant strategic decisions. Liquidity: Movements of this scale can affect the liquidity available on exchanges, impacting trading conditions. Understanding these dynamics is key to navigating the often-unpredictable crypto landscape. While not every large transfer leads to immediate market upheaval, they are certainly data points worth considering for any serious crypto participant. Who Are These Elusive Crypto Whales? The term ‘whale’ in cryptocurrency refers to an individual or entity that holds a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence its market price. These are the giants of the crypto world, whose movements are meticulously tracked by analysts and automated services like Whale Alert. Crypto whales come in various forms: Early Adopters: Individuals who invested heavily in Bitcoin during its nascent stages and now hold vast fortunes. Institutions: Investment firms, hedge funds, and corporations that have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets or manage large crypto portfolios for clients. Exchanges: Centralized exchanges like Kraken hold significant amounts of user funds, and their internal movements for operational purposes can appear as ‘whale’ transactions. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: These are private trading desks that facilitate large transactions between buyers and sellers, often bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact. The anonymity inherent in blockchain technology means that while we can see the transactions, identifying the exact identity behind an ‘unknown wallet’ often remains a mystery. This veil of anonymity is a core feature of blockchain, offering privacy but also fueling speculation about the motives behind large transfers. How Do Such Transfers Impact Your Portfolio? For the average investor, a massive Bitcoin transfer can evoke a mix of curiosity and concern. While it’s easy to jump to conclusions, it’s vital to maintain a balanced perspective and avoid panic-driven decisions.

2025-07-31 19:00:23+00:00,"Bitcoin Bull Market Is Over? Analyst Calls 50% Crash To $60,000","In a post shared on TradingView, crypto analyst Xanrox argues that the current bullish cycle is nearly over, pointing to a potential downtrend that would see the Bitcoin price crash to $60,000. This analysis comes as Bitcoin is trading within a very quiet phase, prompting many crypto traders and crypto analysts to start reassessing its next direction. Xanrox Predicts Bitcoin Top At $122,000 And Crash To $60,000 The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been hovering just above the $118,000 price level for several days now, struggling to break decisively above this zone but also showing no major signs of a breakdown. Despite this consolidation, market sentiment remains upbeat. Related Reading: This Indicator Has Perfectly Called Bitcoin Cycle Tops, Here’s What It’s Saying Now The crypto fear and greed index continues to flash “greed,” and most analysts still argue that Bitcoin is setting up for another leg upward. However, an interesting technical outlook challenges this bullish consensus and issues a crash warning. Notably, crypto analyst Xanrox identified a sell signal on the weekly candlestick timeframe chart after Bitcoin reached the 1.618 Fibonacci extension and touched the long-term 2017–2021–2025 trendline, with the latest touch of the trendline aligning to Bitcoin’s recent all-time high at $122,800. According to him, the most recent touch of this trendline might be the top of the current cycle. Furthermore, he noted that the Elliott Wave structure has now completed Wave 5 of a rising wedge and a larger Wave 5 impulse move. As such, a corrective phase is about to start. What’s Next For Bitcoin? As shown in the chart below, the next major move could be at least a 50% decline, with Bitcoin dropping to around $60,000 by 2026. This projection is based on previous price action, where Bitcoin embarked on 84% and 77% price crashes after touching the trendline in 2017 and 2021, respectively. The technical setup also aligns with statistical data that shows August and September historically bring increased selling pressure. Xanrox noted that while traders can wait for further confirmation, such as a break below the 50-week moving average, he personally believes the top is already in. Large institutions and professional investors pay close attention to the 20, 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short Squeeze Incoming As Market Makers Set Trap To Go Above $123,000 Xanrox’s outlook is a sharp contrast to the prevailing sentiment among crypto investors. Bitcoin’s current structure is still showing strength on higher timeframes, and several other analysts see the recent consolidation between $117,000 and $119,000 as a base for continuation toward $130,000 and beyond. The lack of major sell-side volume, the firm hold above the $118,000 price level and the 50-week moving average, and bullish indicators across altcoins like Ethereum are on-chain signals that the Bitcoin price still has more room to run before it reaches a peak price this cycle.

2025-07-31 19:07:40+00:00,"Altcoin Season Flickers as Cardano, Dogwifhat, Fartcoin Command $1.7B Daily Volume","The crypto market enters August 2025 with traders debating whether a muted altcoin season is underway. While the Altcoin Season Index sits below 40, suggesting Bitcoin dominance remains strong, selective altcoins are showing renewed traction. Three tokens stand out in this cycle: Cardano, Dogwifhat, and Fartcoin. Each reflects a different strand of the current rotation, blending utility, speculation, and liquidity in a cautious market. Cardano Price Holds Amid Ecosystem Growth Cardano is currently trading at $0.77 , giving ADA a market cap of about $27 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Daily trading volume remains above $1.1 billion, showing that liquidity is intact despite the broader altseason index indicating only limited participation. Cardano’s ecosystem is a key driver. Hydra Layer‑2 scaling is live, and the Mithril fast‑sync protocol continues to roll out, designed to reduce node sync times. Governance through the Voltaire upgrade is also progressing, offering ADA holders more influence over treasury allocation. Stablecoin activity has also helped sustain interest. Both Djed and USDA remain active on Cardano, expanding liquidity for DeFi applications. DeFiLlama reports a total value locked of nearly $470 million, marking steady growth through July. Social traction reinforces the picture. LunarCrush data shows steady mentions through July, reflecting renewed retail engagement. These factors together have kept ADA resilient in an otherwise selective altcoin season. Dogwifhat Price Reflects Altcoin Season Dogwifhat’s price sits at roughly $0.96, giving the token a market cap of nearly $964 million. Trading volume has held above $320 million over the past 24 hours, based on CoinMarketCap. For a meme coin launched only in 2023, those figures show persistent speculative activity. Dogwifhat Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Dogwifhat thrives on its role in meme trading cycles. Whale wallets remain active, and their presence across Solana‑based exchanges ensures strong liquidity. While the token has no utility functions beyond trading, its ability to sustain volume and engagement shows its position as a meme‑driven liquidity hub. Traders note that meme assets often gain visibility during altseason rotations, even when the broader market remains cautious. Dogwifhat fits this pattern, attracting attention in a muted environment while contributing to the idea that altcoin season may be forming at the margins. Fartcoin Price Gains on Liquidity Momentum Fartcoin’s price is around $1.05 , supported by a $1.05 billion market cap and $280 million in 24‑hour volume. Fartcoin entered the market as a parody token but has since built consistent liquidity across decentralized exchanges. Its verified contract and strong daily turnover differentiate it from short‑lived meme projects. Weekly performance has also shown steady inflows, supported by active Telegram communities and mentions on LunarCrush. Though lacking functional use cases, its ability to draw liquidity has made it part of altseason conversations, especially among traders seeking high‑beta opportunities when Bitcoin dominance weakens. Altseason Remains Uneven The Altcoin Season Index remains below the threshold of 75 that defines a broad altcoin season. At around 38, the current reading points to selective rotation rather than widespread participation. Bitcoin dominance, above 60% per TradingView’s BTC.D chart, reinforces that most capital remains concentrated in BTC. Bitcoin Dominance (Source: TradingView) Yet the persistence of activity in ADA, Dogwifhat, and Fartcoin suggests that even in a shallow altseason, traders are finding ways to express risk appetite. Cardano represents a long‑standing utility‑driven play, while Dogwifhat and Fartcoin show the meme and liquidity side of speculative markets. If ETF inflows and network upgrades continue to support capital allocation, the current altcoin season could deepen into Q3 and Q4. For now, attention is selective. Tokens like ADA, Dogwifhat, and Fartcoin remain in rotation, showing how narrative, liquidity, and engagement define momentum even when broader altseason signs stay muted.

2025-07-31 19:19:10+00:00,"SEC’s Crypto ETF Rule Marks Structural Shift, Not Retail Gamechanger","A Back-End Upgrade, Not a Front-End Revolution The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted on a structural adjustment allowing crypto ETFs to support in-kind creations and redemptions — a back-end upgrade that serves institutional activity over retail availability, according to experts. Rather than trading in cash for ETF shares, asset managers can now trade actual Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) directly for ETF shares. The mechanism reduces conversion costs, enhances accuracy in pricing, and streamlines business activities for ETF providers. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas referred to it as “a plumbing fix,” insisting that it doesn’t change how individual investors engage with crypto funds. “This does not mean retail can swap IBIT for actual bitcoin,” he further added. Bitwise Pioneers the Way Bitwise Asset Management was the initial U.S. issuer to roll out in-kind redemptions following the SEC’s July 29 ruling. The firm said that both of its Bitcoin and Ether ETFs would begin to offer this structure simultaneously. “It just makes the pipes a little better,” Balchunas added. Previous SEC leadership, including Gary Gensler, had opposed in-kind models because of perceived risks around where the crypto assets came from. Toward Traditional Market Parity The structural upgrade brings crypto ETFs more in line with the structure of traditional exchange-traded products. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro stated that it puts crypto funds in line with institutional-grade ETF structure. 21Shares’ Federico Brokate referred to the move as fundamental to further integration between crypto and the mainstream financial system. ETFs Keep Adding Up Bitcoin The SEC decision comes on the heels of continuous growth in crypto ETF holdings.

A Back-End Upgrade, Not a Front-End Revolution The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) voted on a structural adjustment allowing crypto ETFs to support in-kind creations and redemptions — a back-end upgrade that serves institutional activity over retail availability, according to experts. Rather than trading in cash for ETF shares, asset managers can now trade actual Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH) directly for ETF shares. The mechanism reduces conversion costs, enhances accuracy in pricing, and streamlines business activities for ETF providers. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas referred to it as “a plumbing fix,” insisting that it doesn’t change how individual investors engage with crypto funds. “This does not mean retail can swap IBIT for actual bitcoin,” he further added. Bitwise Pioneers the Way Bitwise Asset Management was the initial U.S. issuer to roll out in-kind redemptions following the SEC’s July 29 ruling. The firm said that both of its Bitcoin and Ether ETFs would begin to offer this structure simultaneously. “It just makes the pipes a little better,” Balchunas added. Previous SEC leadership, including Gary Gensler, had opposed in-kind models because of perceived risks around where the crypto assets came from. Toward Traditional Market Parity The structural upgrade brings crypto ETFs more in line with the structure of traditional exchange-traded products. Bitwise President Teddy Fusaro stated that it puts crypto funds in line with institutional-grade ETF structure. 21Shares’ Federico Brokate referred to the move as fundamental to further integration between crypto and the mainstream financial system. ETFs Keep Adding Up Bitcoin The SEC decision comes on the heels of continuous growth in crypto ETF holdings. As of July 31, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs collectively hold over 1.29 million BTC — approximately 6.18% of circulating supply. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leads the pack with 740,601 BTC worth nearly $88 billion. Fidelity’s fund is second with over 205,000 BTC, with Bitwise holding over 40,000 BTC in its ETF."

It turns out that some of your seemingly private conversations with ChatGPT, when shared, are not remaining as discreet as you might assume. A simple search on Google or Bing, filtered to include URLs from the ChatGPT domain, can unveil a bizarre and sometimes unsettling window into the minds of strangers. This unexpected phenomenon highlights a significant ChatGPT privacy concern that every user should be aware of. Unveiling Public AI Chats: What’s Being Exposed? Imagine the surprise of finding someone’s personal queries about renovating their bathroom, their attempts to grasp complex astrophysics, or even their recipe ideas, all laid bare on a public search engine. These aren’t just abstract data points; they are intimate glimpses into individual lives. The shared links to ChatGPT conversations offer a peculiar insight into human curiosity and vulnerability. The original intent behind ChatGPT’s sharing feature was likely for users to easily share interesting or helpful conversations with friends or colleagues. Users must deliberately click a ‘share’ button on their chat interface and then a ‘create link’ button to generate a shareable URL. OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, states that ‘your name, custom instructions, and any messages you add after sharing stay private.’ However, the reality of search engine indexing paints a different picture, leading to unintended public AI chats being discoverable by anyone. Examples of Exposed Data: Personal Career Details: One user’s attempt to rewrite their resume for a specific job application, complete with enough details to potentially locate their LinkedIn profile, reveals a concerning level of personal information. The irony, as noted, is that the individual seemingly did not get the job, making the public exposure even more poignant. Sensitive Inquiries: Some conversations delve into highly sensitive or controversial topics, resembling discussions found on forums known for extreme viewpoints. This underscores the potential for highly personal or even controversial beliefs to become publicly associated with an individual, even if indirectly. Absurd and Trolling Interactions: While some shared chats are mundane, others reveal users engaging in increasingly absurd or trollish questions, such as asking if one can microwave a metal fork (the answer is a resounding ‘no’). These interactions, though humorous to some, still contribute to a public digital footprint that users likely never intended to create. One memorable example cited was an AI-generated guide titled ‘How to Use a Microwave Without Summoning Satan: A Beginner’s Guide.’ The Role of Google Indexing in Data Exposure The core of this issue lies in how search engines, particularly Google, perform Google indexing . When a web page is created and made accessible on the internet, search engine crawlers discover and add it to their index, making it searchable. While OpenAI’s sharing mechanism creates a unique URL, users likely do not anticipate that these links, even if shared privately, could become part of the public index. There’s a subtle but critical distinction here compared to other cloud services. For instance, when people share public links to files from Google Drive with settings like ‘Anyone with link can view,’ Google generally does not surface these links in search results unless they have been explicitly posted or linked on other public, trusted websites. This implies a level of gatekeeping or discernment. User Expectation vs. Indexing Reality The discrepancy between what users expect when sharing a ChatGPT link and what actually happens with search engine indexing is a significant point of concern. Here’s a quick comparison: Aspect User Expectation (when sharing ChatGPT link) Indexing Reality (for shared ChatGPT links) Audience Only those with the direct link. Anyone using a search engine, potentially globally. Privacy Statement OpenAI states name, custom instructions, and new messages stay private. The entire shared chat log becomes publicly discoverable.

According to real-time market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading around $116,935.78 on major exchanges like Binance’s USDT market. This sudden shift has caught the attention of investors worldwide, prompting questions about the underlying causes and what this means for the broader digital asset landscape. Is this a temporary correction, or a sign of deeper market shifts? Understanding the Significance of the Current Bitcoin Price Drop When the Bitcoin price breaches a significant psychological or technical level like $117,000, it often triggers a cascade of reactions across the market. This isn’t just about a number; it’s about market sentiment, investor confidence, and the potential for further price movements. For many, $117,000 may have been viewed as a key support level, a floor below which the asset would ideally not fall. Its breach suggests that selling pressure has intensified, overcoming immediate buying interest. Psychological Impact: Round numbers or previously established resistance/support levels often act as psychological benchmarks for traders. A break below such a level can induce fear and prompt further selling. Technical Analysis: Traders often use these levels to set stop-loss orders. When the price falls below, these orders are triggered, adding to the selling volume and accelerating the downward trend. Market Contagion: Bitcoin’s dominance means its price movements often influence altcoins. A significant drop in BTC can lead to a broader market downturn. Liquidation Events: Leveraged positions in the derivatives market can face liquidation when prices drop sharply, creating additional selling pressure. What Factors Are Influencing the Current Bitcoin Price Action? The cryptocurrency market is a complex ecosystem influenced by a multitude of factors, ranging from global macroeconomic trends to specific regulatory announcements and even whale movements. Pinpointing a single cause for the current Bitcoin price decline is challenging, but several potential drivers are often at play: Global Macroeconomic Headwinds The broader economic landscape significantly impacts risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Factors such as inflation concerns, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions can lead investors to pull funds from volatile assets and seek safety in more traditional investments or cash. A strengthening US dollar, for instance, often puts pressure on risk assets globally, including Bitcoin. Regulatory Uncertainty and News Regulatory developments, or even the anticipation of them, can have a profound effect on the Bitcoin price . News related to stricter regulations, potential bans, or even delays in favorable regulatory frameworks (like spot Bitcoin ETF approvals) can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among investors, leading to sell-offs. Conversely, positive regulatory clarity can provide a significant boost. Whale Movements and Large Liquidations “Whales” — large holders of Bitcoin — have the capacity to move the market significantly. Large sell orders from whales can overwhelm buying demand, leading to rapid price drops. Furthermore, large-scale liquidations in the derivatives market, where traders use borrowed funds, can amplify price movements. When the Bitcoin price drops to a certain point, these leveraged positions are automatically closed, adding substantial selling pressure. Technical Breakdowns and Market Sentiment Beyond fundamental factors, technical analysis plays a crucial role. A break below a key support level, as observed with the $117,000 mark, can signal a bearish trend to technical traders, prompting them to open short positions or exit long ones. Negative news cycles, social media trends, and overall investor sentiment can also create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where fear leads to selling, which in turn fuels more fear. Navigating Volatility: What Should Investors Consider When Bitcoin Price Dips? Market downturns can be unsettling, but they also present opportunities for informed investors. Here are some strategies and considerations when the Bitcoin price experiences significant drops: 1. Do Your Own Research (DYOR) Before making any investment decisions, it’s paramount to conduct thorough research. Understand Bitcoin’s fundamentals, its long-term potential, and the factors that influence its price. Don’t rely solely on headlines or social media hype. 2.

According to Kiyosaki, even legendary billionaire investors Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have abandoned stocks and bonds. “Do you have a 401k or IRA filled with stocks?

2025-07-31 20:00:00+00:00,"Weak Bitcoin Treasury Companies Will Be Crushed By Bear Market, Insider Warns","The latest What Bitcoin Did episode, hosted by Danny Knowles, turns squarely to the question stalking one of the market’s hottest trades: can the boom in “Bitcoin treasury” companies withstand the next prolonged drawdown? Dylan LeClair, who helps lead the Bitcoin strategy at Tokyo-listed MetaPlanet, argues the answer rests less on ideology than on balance-sheet engineering, scale, and the willingness to endure volatility without blinking. “There’s sort of a ‘gradually then suddenly’ inflection point,” he said, describing how corporate exposure to Bitcoin has migrated from gimmick to boardroom agenda. The shift, in his view, is irreversible, but survival “is a constant fight with gravity” for firms that trade at premiums to their net asset value (NAV). Why Some Bitcoin Treasury Companies Won’t Survive The Bear Market LeClair’s thesis starts with market structure. Bitcoin is homogeneous collateral, but public equities are not. Liquidity, index inclusion, and the absolute size of a balance sheet produce a “winner-take-most dynamic,” he said. Even where two issuers have the same headline premium, the gravity of size changes the calculus: “Strategy is at a measly 1.8x premium, but the premium is like $50 billion of value,” he noted, contrasting that with the far smaller absolute premia attached to emerging players. Premiums compress mechanically as companies buy more Bitcoin or as the price rises, he added, which means maintaining a rich multiple demands ever-larger inflows of capital. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Final Leg Is Near – Time To Be ‘Cautiously Optimistic’? Pressed on what a bear market would do to those premia, LeClair separated cycle folklore from funding reality. He does not buy the inevitability of a 70% “pack it up for three years” drawdown as a base case, arguing the market now tends to reprice and then chop for extended periods. But he is unequivocal that a risk-off phase would punish sloppy balance sheets. “There will be pressure on MNAVs… Are you levered? With what sort of debt? Do you have secured debt where your Bitcoin’s encumbered? Do you have debt due in one year?” By contrast, he pointed to perpetual preferred equity—dividends but “no debt maturity ever”—as a structure that removes the most dangerous cliff: “With the prefs it’s like, no, we’re not selling actually ever.” For MetaPlanet, he framed risk management in deliberately dull terms: “We’re focused on staying… pristine, maintaining maximal flexibility.” He cited a “BTC rating” of roughly 16.5x—“we have 16 bucks of Bitcoin for every dollar of debt”—as intentional dry powder rather than under-optimization. The stress test, to him, is behavioral as much as financial: can management “eat the 70% bear market” if it comes? He expects casualties. “It’s naive to say that every company that adopts Bitcoin will be a success… there will be failures. There will be a bankruptcy… it’s a brutal, competitive world.” Where, then, is the moat? Not merely in being public, he argued, but in graduating from equity capital to the far deeper fixed-income markets. Convertibles provided early leverage—but at a cost he described with traderly bluntness. Convertible desks “woo you,” then short aggressively to hedge, “dampening the volatility” that many treasury companies actually want in their common stock. The more durable solution, he said, is permanent capital in the form of preferred equity. Here he credits Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with reaching “escape velocity,” pioneering a layered capital stack that now includes a new variable-rate preferred dubbed “Stretch” (ticker: STRC). Stretch is engineered to keep trading near $100 by adjusting its dividend and, if necessary, issuing new shares or calling them at $101—“a pretty genius feat of financial engineering,” in LeClair’s words, because it behaves like a cash-equivalent for investors without imposing maturity cliffs on the issuer. Strategy priced STRC in late July with an initial dividend framework and then closed a multi-billion-dollar offering, with the company describing the instrument as variable-rate, perpetual preferred stock designed to pay monthly and target trading near par. LeClair sees this as the practical realization of a long-standing ambition in crypto finance: a dollar-like instrument tied to Bitcoin collateral, without forcing asset sales in stress.

The latest What Bitcoin Did episode, hosted by Danny Knowles, turns squarely to the question stalking one of the market’s hottest trades: can the boom in “Bitcoin treasury” companies withstand the next prolonged drawdown? Dylan LeClair, who helps lead the Bitcoin strategy at Tokyo-listed MetaPlanet, argues the answer rests less on ideology than on balance-sheet engineering, scale, and the willingness to endure volatility without blinking. “There’s sort of a ‘gradually then suddenly’ inflection point,” he said, describing how corporate exposure to Bitcoin has migrated from gimmick to boardroom agenda. The shift, in his view, is irreversible, but survival “is a constant fight with gravity” for firms that trade at premiums to their net asset value (NAV). Why Some Bitcoin Treasury Companies Won’t Survive The Bear Market LeClair’s thesis starts with market structure. Bitcoin is homogeneous collateral, but public equities are not. Liquidity, index inclusion, and the absolute size of a balance sheet produce a “winner-take-most dynamic,” he said. Even where two issuers have the same headline premium, the gravity of size changes the calculus: “Strategy is at a measly 1.8x premium, but the premium is like $50 billion of value,” he noted, contrasting that with the far smaller absolute premia attached to emerging players. Premiums compress mechanically as companies buy more Bitcoin or as the price rises, he added, which means maintaining a rich multiple demands ever-larger inflows of capital. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Final Leg Is Near – Time To Be ‘Cautiously Optimistic’? Pressed on what a bear market would do to those premia, LeClair separated cycle folklore from funding reality. He does not buy the inevitability of a 70% “pack it up for three years” drawdown as a base case, arguing the market now tends to reprice and then chop for extended periods. But he is unequivocal that a risk-off phase would punish sloppy balance sheets. “There will be pressure on MNAVs… Are you levered? With what sort of debt? Do you have secured debt where your Bitcoin’s encumbered? Do you have debt due in one year?” By contrast, he pointed to perpetual preferred equity—dividends but “no debt maturity ever”—as a structure that removes the most dangerous cliff: “With the prefs it’s like, no, we’re not selling actually ever.” For MetaPlanet, he framed risk management in deliberately dull terms: “We’re focused on staying… pristine, maintaining maximal flexibility.” He cited a “BTC rating” of roughly 16.5x—“we have 16 bucks of Bitcoin for every dollar of debt”—as intentional dry powder rather than under-optimization. The stress test, to him, is behavioral as much as financial: can management “eat the 70% bear market” if it comes? He expects casualties. “It’s naive to say that every company that adopts Bitcoin will be a success… there will be failures. There will be a bankruptcy… it’s a brutal, competitive world.” Where, then, is the moat? Not merely in being public, he argued, but in graduating from equity capital to the far deeper fixed-income markets. Convertibles provided early leverage—but at a cost he described with traderly bluntness. Convertible desks “woo you,” then short aggressively to hedge, “dampening the volatility” that many treasury companies actually want in their common stock. The more durable solution, he said, is permanent capital in the form of preferred equity. Here he credits Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with reaching “escape velocity,” pioneering a layered capital stack that now includes a new variable-rate preferred dubbed “Stretch” (ticker: STRC). Stretch is engineered to keep trading near $100 by adjusting its dividend and, if necessary, issuing new shares or calling them at $101—“a pretty genius feat of financial engineering,” in LeClair’s words, because it behaves like a cash-equivalent for investors without imposing maturity cliffs on the issuer. Strategy priced STRC in late July with an initial dividend framework and then closed a multi-billion-dollar offering, with the company describing the instrument as variable-rate, perpetual preferred stock designed to pay monthly and target trading near par. LeClair sees this as the practical realization of a long-standing ambition in crypto finance: a dollar-like instrument tied to Bitcoin collateral, without forcing asset sales in stress. Unlike algorithmic stablecoins that were vulnerable to redemptions spirals, Strategy’s preferreds are senior to common equity and massively over-collateralized by transparent Bitcoin holdings, he argued. External observers have reached similar high-level descriptions: Strategy’s own materials emphasize STRC’s variable dividend on a stated $100 amount, while coverage in financial media notes the offering’s explicit aim to hew to par and its place alongside earlier preferreds (Stride, Strike, Strife) in a capital stack backed by tens of billions in unencumbered Bitcoin.

2025-07-31 20:00:17+00:00,Bank of Russia to scrap cards issued by Visa and Mastercard,"Bank of Russia is considering dates for terminating services for cards issued by the globally accepted payment networks Mastercard and Visa. The monetary authority made it clear it’s not rushing the process, as it hopes for a gradual transition to cards based on its own payment system called Mir, but also pointed out Russians can make the change as soon as they want. Days of Mastercard and Visa cards numbered in Russia The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is preparing to phase out Visa and Mastercard payment cards, replacing them with the Russian Mir cards, TASS reported, quoting the press service of the country’s main financial regulator. The authority is currently considering a deadline for Russian banks to discontinue support for cards issued by the U.S.-headquartered corporations, the official news agency detailed. The CBR is also expecting its replacement with its own Mir cards to be gradual. A spokesperson for the institution was quoted as stating: “We are currently considering the timeline, during which the servicing of cards of international payment systems should stop. It will be reasonable and sufficient for the banks to gradually replace them with Mir cards.” The Bank of Russia emphasized that international cards are still working as usual and that there is no urgent need to pull them out yet. It also noted that commercial banks will promptly inform clients about upcoming changes. Nevertheless, the regulator highlighted that Russian users can substitute them with Mir cards at any time, if they so wish. “The decision to extend the validity period for cards of international payment systems that left the Russian market was made so that people could continue to use these cards,” the CBR remarked, but then stated: “Currently, the need for the measure has lost relevance – the share of such cards in circulation is decreasing, people themselves prefer to replace them with relevant domestic ones.” Russia to scrap foreign cards 3 years after invading Ukraine Visa and Mastercard suspended their operations in the Russian Federation soon after Moscow invaded Ukraine in early 2022. Since then, their cards issued for Russian banks can be used only inside the country. After the American giants pulled out of the Russian market, local banking institutions, working with the National Payment Card System ( NSPK ), extended the validity of their cards. Earlier this month, news came out that the Central Bank of Russia intends to set a maximum validity period for all of them. The NSPK, which is wholly owned and controlled by the CBR, is Russia’s payment clearing house processing bank card transactions within its borders and the operator of the Mir card payment system. It also provides clearing for the Faster Payments System ( SBP ), which allows Russians to initiate interbank transfers using only a mobile phone number, and to make and receive payments through a QR code. Meanwhile, the Bank of Russia has been preparing to launch a digital version of the national fiat. The digital ruble will be introduced in stages, starting from September 2026, the monetary authority announced in June, after President Putin called for mass adoption of the sovereign digital coin. The introduction of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be accompanied by wider implementation of payments using the universal QR code already available through the SPB, as Cryptopolitan reported last month. The days of crypto payments in Russia, strongly opposed by the CBR, also seem numbered. The Russian government has been tightening the noose on transactions with Bitcoin and the like by adopting a package of laws , targeting peer-to-peer trades and curbing crypto usage in general. The only loophole for cryptocurrency payments that is likely to remain open is the one suggested by the CBR itself. That’s the “experimental legal regime” that allows Russian companies to use digital coins in foreign trade, in order to circumvent war-related sanctions that have severely limited their access to the global financial system.

2025-07-31 20:00:25+00:00,Ondo Finance Featured In White House Report As Key Player In RWA Tokenized Finance,"Ondo Finance continues to strengthen its position as a leading force in the tokenized finance space. Since launching its token in January 2024, the project has grown rapidly, carving out a prominent role in the intersection of Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization and decentralized finance (DeFi) integration with traditional finance (TradFi). This momentum reached a new milestone yesterday when the White House, through the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, officially recognized Ondo Finance in a new report. The report highlights tokenized securities, stablecoins, and programmable settlement as foundational to the future of the global financial system—and named Ondo among the key players leading that shift. This recognition not only legitimizes Ondo’s work but also reinforces the growing role of RWA tokenization in institutional and regulatory conversations. Their focus on equity tokenization through its custom-built Ondo Chain and its flagship tokenized US Treasury product has attracted growing interest from investors and institutions. With policy and innovation converging, the project stands out as a critical bridge between legacy markets and the decentralized future, signaling strong potential ahead for both the protocol and the broader tokenization narrative. Ondo Finance Spotlighted in White House Report In the recent report from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets, Ondo was featured as a core example of how tokenized systems operate—further cementing its role at the forefront of the Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization movement. According to the report, industry estimates suggest that over $600 billion in RWAs could be tokenized by 2030, including money market fund shares, fixed-income instruments, private credit, and private fund shares. The report highlights that firms are approaching tokenization through two primary models: either building private, permissioned blockchains or deploying permissioned layers on top of public, permissionless networks. Ondo stands out for its hybrid approach—leveraging public infrastructure while maintaining institutional-grade compliance. A detailed chart in the report even uses Ondo to illustrate the end-to-end tokenization process. Crucially, the regulatory status of tokenized assets is determined not by the act of tokenization itself, but by the nature of the underlying asset. Since most current tokenization volume involves securities such as fixed income and private credit, these assets are generally subject to securities regulation. However, the report also notes the growing presence of tokenized commodities like gold and tokenized non-financial assets such as real estate and rare collectibles. Ondo’s inclusion in the White House report signals growing mainstream and regulatory acknowledgment of tokenized finance. With its flagship US Treasury-backed products and expansion into tokenized equities via Ondo Chain, the protocol is poised to play a major role in shaping the digital financial infrastructure of the next decade. Price Action Details: Key Level To Watch Ondo has reclaimed the $0.99 level after a volatile pullback, gaining nearly 5% on the day. The recent price bounce comes after testing the 50-day moving average (MA) at $0.86 as support, which coincides with a key psychological threshold and prior accumulation range. This area has historically triggered renewed interest from buyers, especially after sharp corrections like the one seen in mid-July. However, ONDO remains below the 200-day MA at $0.97, which now acts as immediate resistance. The token broke above this level last week after bullish momentum pushed the price past $1.20 but failed to hold the highs as sellers took profits. A sustained close above the 200-day MA could re-establish bullish control and open the path back toward the $1.20 zone. The structure still reflects a broader recovery from the multi-month downtrend that started in January 2025. If ONDO can consolidate above $0.95 and reclaim $1.05, it could mark a new higher low and signal trend continuation. On the other hand, losing the 50-day MA again would invalidate the current bounce and suggest a deeper retest toward $0.85 or even $0.78 support.

Scheduled for October 22–23, 2025, in London, this year’s event promises to be one of the most significant yet. With a star-studded lineup of speakers from leading financial institutions, including BlackRock, Citi, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, BNY Mellon, Nasdaq, and more, XRP holders are buzzing with anticipation and speculation. One name, in particular, is drawing intense attention: Maxwell Stein, Director of Digital Assets at BlackRock. His scheduled appearance at SWELL has fueled growing hopes that BlackRock could be preparing to launch an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , a move that would mark a monumental step in XRP’s journey toward broader institutional adoption. Crypto influencer Crypto Eri was among the first to spotlight the significance of Stein’s presence, posting the complete speaker list and urging the XRP community to “connect the dots.” Her post quickly gained traction, with many interpreting BlackRock’s involvement as a major signal of what may come next.

The company’s presence at Ripple SWELL, specifically through a digital asset executive, has stoked optimism that groundwork is being laid for a potential XRP ETF filing. The timing couldn’t be more appropriate. Ripple has been steadily positioning XRP at the heart of institutional-grade financial infrastructure. With the launch of RLUSD, Ripple’s U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and growing demand for compliant cross-border payment solutions, an XRP ETF would be a logical next step for institutional investors. Major Banks and Institutions Join the Conversation Beyond BlackRock, several major financial institutions will be participating in SWELL 2025, further validating Ripple’s growing influence in traditional finance. Citi’s Ryan Rugg, Global Head of Digital Assets for Treasury & Trade Solutions, is scheduled to speak. Citi has previously explored blockchain-based settlement solutions, including partnerships aligned with Ripple’s technology. Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul, known for her thought leadership in tokenization and digital asset strategy, is another high-profile speaker. Franklin Templeton has actively pursued blockchain innovation, often in parallel with Ripple’s institutional objectives. Carolyn Weinberg, Chief Product & Innovation Officer at BNY Mellon, represents a bank that has been a custodian leader in digital assets. Her presence signals a continued focus on integrating digital assets like XRP into secure, compliant custodial services. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cynthia Lo Bessette, who heads Fidelity Digital Asset Management, brings the perspective of one of the earliest institutional backers of crypto infrastructure and ETFs. Her appearance adds further intrigue, especially given Fidelity’s exploration of tokenized assets. Ripple’s Leadership and Institutional Strategy Ripple’s executive team will be out in full force at SWELL, including Brad Garlinghouse (CEO) , Monica Long (President), Stuart Alderoty (Chief Legal Officer), and Jack McDonald (SVP of Stablecoins). They are expected to share critical updates on RippleNet expansion, regulatory developments, and the evolving use of XRP in liquidity solutions and global settlements. Ripple’s institutional strategy is clear: build a regulatory-compliant, scalable ecosystem where digital assets like XRP play a central role in powering the future of finance. With support from global banking leaders and top-tier asset managers, Ripple is turning that vision into reality. Connecting the Dots With speakers from BlackRock, Fidelity, Citi, BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, and others on the agenda, SWELL 2025 is shaping up to be a convergence point of institutional finance and blockchain innovation. The XRP community is not just paying attention; they’re reading between the lines. The presence of BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets at Ripple’s flagship event is no coincidence. While no XRP ETF has been officially filed, the signs are hard to ignore. From increasing institutional engagement to regulatory clarity, all the right pieces seem to be falling into place. For now, XRP holders are doing exactly what Crypto Eri suggested: connecting the dots and waiting for the next big move.

Major Banks and Institutions Join the Conversation Beyond BlackRock, several major financial institutions will be participating in SWELL 2025, further validating Ripple’s growing influence in traditional finance. Citi’s Ryan Rugg, Global Head of Digital Assets for Treasury & Trade Solutions, is scheduled to speak. Citi has previously explored blockchain-based settlement solutions, including partnerships aligned with Ripple’s technology. Franklin Templeton’s Sandy Kaul, known for her thought leadership in tokenization and digital asset strategy, is another high-profile speaker. Franklin Templeton has actively pursued blockchain innovation, often in parallel with Ripple’s institutional objectives. Carolyn Weinberg, Chief Product & Innovation Officer at BNY Mellon, represents a bank that has been a custodian leader in digital assets. Her presence signals a continued focus on integrating digital assets like XRP into secure, compliant custodial services. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Cynthia Lo Bessette, who heads Fidelity Digital Asset Management, brings the perspective of one of the earliest institutional backers of crypto infrastructure and ETFs. Her appearance adds further intrigue, especially given Fidelity’s exploration of tokenized assets. Ripple’s Leadership and Institutional Strategy Ripple’s executive team will be out in full force at SWELL, including Brad Garlinghouse (CEO) , Monica Long (President), Stuart Alderoty (Chief Legal Officer), and Jack McDonald (SVP of Stablecoins). They are expected to share critical updates on RippleNet expansion, regulatory developments, and the evolving use of XRP in liquidity solutions and global settlements. Ripple’s institutional strategy is clear: build a regulatory-compliant, scalable ecosystem where digital assets like XRP play a central role in powering the future of finance. With support from global banking leaders and top-tier asset managers, Ripple is turning that vision into reality. Connecting the Dots With speakers from BlackRock, Fidelity, Citi, BNY Mellon, Franklin Templeton, and others on the agenda, SWELL 2025 is shaping up to be a convergence point of institutional finance and blockchain innovation. The XRP community is not just paying attention; they’re reading between the lines. The presence of BlackRock’s Director of Digital Assets at Ripple’s flagship event is no coincidence. While no XRP ETF has been officially filed, the signs are hard to ignore. From increasing institutional engagement to regulatory clarity, all the right pieces seem to be falling into place. For now, XRP holders are doing exactly what Crypto Eri suggested: connecting the dots and waiting for the next big move.

It is using accredited investors to provide direct exposure to IP, the native cryptocurrency of Story Protocol. Grayscale has made a major push into blockchain-based intellectual property infrastructure this time around with its latest Bitcoin and Ethereum product. A New Frontier: Blockchain Meets Intellectual Property The Story Protocol integrates licensing , attribution, and royalty streams into on-chain assets. The smart contract-facilitated tools are especially relevant in an era rife with AI-generated content and mounting legal uncertainties surrounding data ownership. “Grayscale Story Trust offers investors exposure to a protocol that is developing the underlying intellectual property layer for the information and AI era,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Head of Product & Research at Grayscale. The trust will operate similarly to Grayscale’s other single-asset products, holding IP as its sole asset and allowing regulated investment exposure to a market that is expected to be valued at $80 trillion worldwide. Real-World Demand and Use Cases Story Protocol is already processing over 1.7 million IP transactions a month, from music royalties to robotic surgery data sets. Its token, $IP, derives demand from creators and AI developers that need licensed, verifiable content — unlike the majority of speculative digital assets. This blockchain-first platform gives AI companies buying training data transparency, and also allows artists, researchers, and developers to embed immutable ownership and revenue structures directly into their work. Limited Access For Now The Grayscale Story Trust is currently offered to accredited investors only, which means individuals with $200,000+ annual income or institutions with $5 million+ in assets. Listing on the secondary market may be next, pending regulatory approval. This mirrors the strategy of Grayscale with its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts, which started out as private placements and became ETFs. Those funds had $21.2 billion and $4.25 billion in AUM as of July 30, respectively. The Bigger Picture Grayscale’s foray into the IP token economy is a sign of growing institutional confidence in the viability of blockchain use cases beyond finance.

2025-07-31 20:24:00+00:00,Pepe Price Prediction: Whale Selling Triggers Huge Drop – Panic Is Spreading Fast,"Pepe (PEPE) has dropped 9% over the past 7 days, underperforming most other meme coins during the latest pullback — putting the current Pepe price prediction into question. Is this a sign of deeper weakness and a bearish mid-term outlook, or just a healthy correction before the next leg up? Data from CoinDesk Research shows that whales have been offloading PEPE recently, although not all of these sales appear to be voluntary, hinting at liquidations or forced exits rather than broad loss of confidence. Whale James Wynn got liquidated again. This time he was long on $PEPE . Tough to watch him lose that much. pic.twitter.com/aSNZJbpOfA — Ted (@TedPillows) July 29, 2025 A notable PEPE trader called James Wynn, who previously made a fortune by buying the meme coin once it was an unknown token for the rest of the world, was recently liquidated out of a long position. A total of $207 million worth of long positions were impacted by PEPE’s latest drop, inflicting losses of around $180,000 to Wynn in a relatively short period. This trader, known for his high-risk strategy, has seen both massive wins and painful losses. While his approach once delivered life-changing returns, the tides have turned — he was forced out of a $1 billion Bitcoin position in May, reportedly losing around $60 million. PEPE’s open interest has also taken a hit. After peaking at $1 billion on July 22, it has since plunged sharply, suggesting that many traders — possibly similar to Wynn — have been wiped out during PEPE’s 21.4% drop from $0.000014 to $0.000011. This wave of forced exits raises a critical question: Is whale capitulation an early warning sign of a deeper correction ahead? And with price action breaking key levels, does the current structure support a bearish PEPE price prediction for the mid-term? Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Could Drop to $0.00000850 If It Breaks Below This Key Support Pepe’s daily chart shows that the price started to retreat upon hitting the $0.00001450 mark and dropped below the 200-day exponential moving average in the past few days. Now, the 9-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) have made a ‘death cross’ as they crossed below their long-term peer. This favors a bearish Pepe price prediction and could mark the beginning of a pronounced downtrend. The key support to watch at this point is the $0.00001050 area. If PEPE breaks below this level, the odds would favor a push to a much higher zone – possibly at around $0.00000850. However, since market sentiment and momentum still favor a bullish outlook, short-selling PEPE at this point would be risky as it means going against the prevailing trend. A confirmed breakout below $0.00001050 would justify taking a short position. Whether you believe that PEPE will drop to these low levels or the opposite, you can profit from your prediction through a new crypto futures trading platform called CoinFutures that lets you take directional positions on your favorite cryptocurrencies without the hassle of doing real trading. CoinFutures Supports Auto Trading Features and Offers 1000X Leverage to Boost Gains CoinFutures allows users to profit from the future price movements of top cryptos like Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA), and Ethereum (ETH) without buying these cryptocurrencies directly. Meme coins like PEPE will be added to the platform shortly as well. The platform mimics the real-time volatility and price action of the crypto market through a sophisticated algorithm and integrations with top exchanges to offer transparent pricing. Users can use a price multiplier feature to take much larger positions and potentially increase their profits if the market moves in their favor. Moreover, an auto trading tool can be used to set a stop-loss and take-profit target to limit losses and cash out when the position turns a profit.

2025-07-31 20:24:22+00:00,Coinbase Stock Tumbles 7% After Disappointing Q2 Results,"Coinbase (COIN) reported worse than expected second-quarter results on Thursday, sending its shares down 7% in post-market trading. The crypto exchange posted total revenue of $1.5 billion, up from $1.45 billion in the same quarter last year but slightly lower than FactSet estimates of $1.59 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) came in at $512 million, down from $596 million a year ago. The results show Coinbase’s continued sensitivity to crypto market cycles. Even though bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) rallied to new yearly highs during the second quarter, transaction volume fell from a quarter-to-quarter basis, Coinbase said in a press release. As a result, transaction revenue was $764 million, a 39% drop from the first quarter. Coinbase’s report follows an upbeat performance from rival Robinhood (HOOD), which reported its own quarterly results on Wednesday. HOOD, which is up 160% year-to-date, beat expectations as the company saw $28.3 billion in crypto trading volume in the second quarter. Coinbase, meanwhile, continues to lean into its dual identity as both a retail trading hub and institutional crypto infrastructure provider. The company has launched custody services for spot bitcoin ETFs, expanded its staking offerings and made further progress with its Base layer-2 network, though these businesses remain secondary to trading revenue. “In Q2, Coinbase made significant strides in bringing the financial system onchain by expanding access to trading through innovative derivative products, listing more spot assets, and expanding our offerings in markets globally,” the company said in its earnings release.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/31/template-coinbase-earnings,EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|BTC,Markets|Coinbase|Earnings|News,BTC,"Coinbase Stock Tumbles 7% After Disappointing Q2 Results.

2025-07-31 20:52:10+00:00,Altseason 2025: Top Altcoins Surge as Bitcoin Hits $120K – 6 Must-See Charts,"A fresh wave of capital is flooding into altcoins as Bitcoin trades near $120,000. According to a new CryptoQuant report, several key indicators are pointing to a possible “altseason,” a period when alternative cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin dominance, which measures BTC’s market share, has dropped sharply. The metric fell by over 6.3% in recent weeks and is now sitting at around 60.5%, the lowest level since March. 2025 Altseason? Altcoins are heating up after Bitcoin’s breakout to ~$120K. For example, Ethereum is up +170% from the recent lows and just ~23% from its ATH at $4,871. Here are 6 key charts showing this market shift pic.twitter.com/8fUZELmhMy — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) July 31, 2025 This decline often indicates a shift in market focus from Bitcoin to altcoins. Analysts say the pattern is playing out similar to 2021, when Ethereum and other tokens began to surge after Bitcoin led the initial rally. Ethereum Rallies 56% in a Month Amid Growing Institutional Confidence Ethereum (ETH) has posted a 56% gain in the past month alone and is now trading around $3,854. It is only 23% away from reclaiming its all-time high of $4,871. Much of the renewed interest in ETH has been fueled by institutional demand for Ethereum. SharpLink Gaming confirmed last week it now holds 438,190 ETH, worth approximately $1.6 billion, with over 95% being staked or earning yield through liquid staking platforms. The company added over 77,000 ETH in a single week, spending $290 million at an average price of $3,756. Its ETH concentration has jumped 70% since early June. Source: CryptoQuant Meanwhile, BitMine Immersion Technologies now leads all corporate holders with over 625,000 ETH as part of its growing $2.3 billion ETH treasury. Together, 65 institutions now hold 2.33 million ETH, worth $8.9 billion, accounting for 1.93% of Ethereum’s total supply , according to data from Strategic ETH Reserve (SER). Holdings have surged since April, with a noticeable spike in late June, reflecting growing institutional confidence in ETH as a treasury asset. This renewed interest coincides with Ethereum gaining strength against Bitcoin, as the ETH/BTC pair shows signs of upward momentum, an early signal often associated with the onset of altcoin-led rallies. Supporting this trend, CryptoQuant reports that ETH and altcoin futures volume recently reached $223.6 billion, marking the highest level in five months and reinforcing the narrative of renewed bullish interest in the broader altcoin market. Source: CryptoQuant “Altcoins are seeing heavy trading,” the firm stated. It also noted that Ethereum perpetual futures volume dominance has overtaken Bitcoin for the first time since 2022. ETH futures open interest climbed to $58 billion, with volume doubling since late June. CryptoQuant observed that altcoins and ETH now make up 83% of total futures volume, while BTC accounts for just 17%. At the same time, retail interest is picking up again. Transactions under $10,000 are up 9.7% over the past 30 days. Historically, this metric has surged ahead of major rallies in both Bitcoin and altcoins. CryptoQuant explained, “This increase aligns with psychological thresholds being crossed in BTC price, drawing in smaller investors and speculators.” The overall crypto market has added nearly $900 billion in value over the past three weeks, pushing the total market cap to $3.9 trillion. Altcoin Season Index Nearly Doubles as Market Rotation Intensifies Alongside Ethereum’s rally, other major altcoins are also on the rise. BNB is up 23% over 30 days, Solana has gained more than 21%, and XRP is up 44%. Meme coins are having their moment too, with BONK jumping 148% and FLOKI climbing 119%. Even lower-cap tokens are outperforming, with PENGU and SPX both posting gains of over 250%. Out of 424 futures trading pairs on Binance, only 23 posted losses since Bitcoin broke its all-time high, showing that over 94% of the altcoin market has reacted positively. Veteran trader Merlijn said Bitcoin dominance has entered “Phase 4″—a breakdown stage. “This is the biggest sign of an Altseason and upcoming parabolic pump,” said Ash Crypto , another analyst. A key technical indicator is also flashing. Bitcoin dominance has formed a bearish cross on the three-week chart and broken a three-year uptrend line. This breakdown suggests that Bitcoin’s share of the crypto market is losing strength, which historically leads to capital rotation into altcoins. The rise in ETH futures open interest to $58 billion, up from just $20 billion in April, is further proof of this momentum. In fact, this is more than what it was when ETH traded near $4,000 last December. Analysts see this as a strong sign of fresh capital entering the Ethereum market. Meanwhile, Ether’s open interest dominance has risen to 40%, a level rarely seen.

2025-07-31 20:53:37+00:00,Coinbase Q2 earnings miss Wall Street estimates with disappointing numbers,"Coinbase failed Wall Street’s expectations in Q2 2025, pulling in $1.5 billion in revenue and $1.4 billion in net income, according to the company’s quarterly filing. The figures include a $1.5 billion unrealized gain from strategic investments and another $362 million from its crypto holdings. Even without those, Adjusted Net Income stood at $33 million, and Adjusted EBITDA reached $512 million. Transaction revenue came in at $764 million, while subscriptions and services brought in $656 million, fueled by rising USDC balances, increased staking activity, and record Prime Financing balances. By the end of June, Coinbase had $9.3 billion in U.S. dollar resources and $1.8 billion in crypto assets held for investment, thanks to consistent weekly Bitcoin purchases. They also reported the highest average custody share in their history, signaling stronger control over crypto asset safekeeping on their platform. Coinbase rolls out new derivatives, boosts app platform, and targets payments During the quarter, Coinbase pushed forward with its on-chain strategy by expanding crypto trading, financial tools, and its software infrastructure. On the trading side, it introduced the widest set of CFTC-approved perpetual futures contracts in the country, which drove record volume and open interest on its international derivatives exchange. At the same time, it kept listing new spot assets and grew its presence in global markets. Coinbase also continued expanding USDC usage by integrating it into Shopify Payments, Coinbase Business, and the Coinbase One Card. These moves brought stablecoin utility closer to daily consumer spending. The company said average USDC balances rose 13% from the last quarter, reaching $13.8 billion, helped by the reintroduction of a rewards program. As part of its lending efforts, Coinbase grew its Prime Financing operation to new highs, serving corporates, miners, hedge funds, and asset managers. According to the company, 16 of its 25 biggest institutional clients now use its financing tools. The firm also offered retail users up to $1 million in instant USDC loans, backed by BTC and settled on-chain through the Morpho protocol. Those loans now exceed $1 billion in open collateral. Meanwhile, Shopify merchants across the U.S. are now able to accept USDC, and customers who use it get 1% back in rewards, with a full rollout expected later this year. Q2 operating expenses spiked by $193 million, or 15%, mostly due to a $307 million charge linked to the data breach that was revealed in May. However, other major costs (tech, admin, and marketing) dropped 2%, totaling $977 million. Coinbase reported a full-time headcount of 4,279 employees. Although the company’s total dollar resources dropped 6% quarter-over-quarter, ending at $9.3 billion, Coinbase still has access to $12.1 billion when counting its crypto held for investment and as loan collateral. Of that, $951 million was held as collateral, and the company added $222 million in BTC during the quarter through routine weekly buys. Custody operations also scaled up. Coinbase now holds $245.7 billion in crypto under custody, the highest share of global crypto market cap it’s ever had. It also manages over 80% of all BTC and ETH ETF assets based in the U.S. New crypto laws and tokenized assets set the stage for the next phase Coinbase’s quarter closed as Washington began loosening up on crypto regulation under the Trump administration. In July, Congress passed the CLARITY Act , and President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law. The two bills give regulatory clarity for stablecoins and crypto market structure, a win for Coinbase and its long-term roadmap. At the same time, the company announced plans for an “everything exchange” that brings tokenized stocks, real-world assets, derivatives, and prediction markets on-chain. Max Branzburg, Coinbase’s VP of Product, said the rollout will start in the U.S. and expand globally once jurisdictions give the green light. “We’re building an exchange for everything,” Max said in an interview with CNBC. “Everything you want to trade, in a one-stop shop, on-chain. … We’re bringing all assets onchain—stocks, prediction markets, and more.” CEO Brian Armstrong said he wants Coinbase to be the top financial app in the world over the next decade. That includes pushing further into consumer tools, expanding tokenized products, and using new regulatory support to go global faster. As for Q3, Coinbase expects transaction revenue for July to hit $360 million. Full quarter projections show $665 to $745 million in subscription and service revenue, driven by USDC’s record market cap and higher crypto prices. Tech and admin costs are expected between $800 and $850 million, with marketing expenses ranging from $190 to $290 million, depending on performance-based campaigns and USDC user engagement.

2025-07-31 20:58:08+00:00,"Cryptocurrency Analysis Company Assesses the Current Status of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and SUI – What is the Current Situation?","According to the latest analysis by cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment, various indicators and trends are attracting attention in the Bitcoin and altcoin markets. The increased use of the word “dip” on social media suggests retail investors are looking for dip-buying opportunities. However, analyst Brian cautioned against this, noting that markets often move against the crowd''s expectations. The 30-day MVRV (market value/realized value) ratio is 1.8%, while the 365-day MVRV is 22%. This suggests a risk of market overheating. Meanwhile, whale wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin have been observed selling approximately 16,500 Bitcoin since July 15th. While these sales were not aggressive, they do not necessarily support a price increase. On the Ethereum side, whales have been buying for the past three weeks. Whales holding more than 10,000 ETH are reported to have added approximately 0.5% of the total supply to their wallets. However, Ethereum''s 30-day MVRV is hovering around 14%, while its long-term MVRV is around 36.5%. These high levels suggest the market is in the “danger zone” and may be entering a correction or cooling-off period. Santiment analysts also shared their assessments of various altcoins: XRP: It is noted that the risk has increased in XRP, which is at high levels with a 30-day MVRV of 8.7% and a 365-day MVRV of 45%. Solana: Fear is prevalent in the Solana market, with a low positive/negative comment ratio on social media. SUI: Unlike other assets, SUI''s sentiment is quite high.

According to the latest analysis by cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment, various indicators and trends are attracting attention in the Bitcoin and altcoin markets. The increased use of the word “dip” on social media suggests retail investors are looking for dip-buying opportunities. However, analyst Brian cautioned against this, noting that markets often move against the crowd''s expectations. The 30-day MVRV (market value/realized value) ratio is 1.8%, while the 365-day MVRV is 22%. This suggests a risk of market overheating. Meanwhile, whale wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin have been observed selling approximately 16,500 Bitcoin since July 15th. While these sales were not aggressive, they do not necessarily support a price increase. On the Ethereum side, whales have been buying for the past three weeks. Whales holding more than 10,000 ETH are reported to have added approximately 0.5% of the total supply to their wallets. However, Ethereum''s 30-day MVRV is hovering around 14%, while its long-term MVRV is around 36.5%.

2025-07-31 21:00:07+00:00,"Bitcoin Sees Rising New Investor Dominance, Old Holders Yet To Capitulate","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate slightly below the $120,000 level, the dominance of new investors is steadily rising. However, on-chain data shows that BTC is still far from overheating, suggesting the premier cryptocurrency may have more room to run before a significant correction sets in. Bitcoin May Still Have Some Room To Run According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor AxelAdlerJr, new investor dominance in Bitcoin is gradually increasing – currently hovering around 30%, which is only halfway to the historical “overheated” threshold. Related Reading: Bitcoin Overheating Signals Easing – Is A Second-Half Rally Ahead? The analyst shared the following chart, which highlights two past instances – marked in orange – when new investor dominance reached overheated levels and coincided with BTC local price tops. The first instance occurred in March 2024 when the metric hit 64%, and the second in December 2024 when it peaked at 72%. In both cases, BTC experienced a significant pullback, leading to the formation of local bottoms. Notably, as the influx of new liquidity dried up during these phases, long-term holders began actively taking profits. This added further pressure on BTC’s price. Currently, while new investor dominance is trending higher, it remains well below the euphoria zone – typically between 60% and 70% – suggesting more upside potential in BTC’s bullish momentum before exhaustion. Meanwhile, older holders continue to sell moderately. The chart indicates a coefficient of 0.3, showing that the supply of three-year-old BTC is still absorbing fresh demand without sharp disruptions. From a long-term perspective, the market remains balanced, and the risk of large-scale capitulation from veteran wallets appears low. AxelAdlerJr concluded: If the indicator’s growth accelerates and approaches the historical corridor of 0.6-0.7, one should expect intensified profit-taking and, consequently, a correction. For now, the supply/demand structure remains in a healthy late bull cycle phase, when new money is coming in but old players have not yet transitioned to mass selling. Is BTC Price About To Stall? While the data above suggests that Bitcoin still has room to grow, other indicators point to waning momentum. One such signal is the recent decline in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap, which has broken its long streak of positive values.

2025-07-31 21:07:53+00:00,Strategy reports $14.03B in Q2 operating income and $10.02B in net income,"Strategy posted its biggest quarterly earnings ever in Q2 2025, and the reason is crystal clear: it’s sitting on a mountain of Bitcoin. The company, which now identifies as a Bitcoin treasury firm, reported $14.03 billion in operating income, a record-setting figure driven by crypto gains. This number shows a 7,106.4% increase from the same quarter last year, when the firm posted a $200 million operating loss. Strategy’s stock MSTR has surged by 2% after hours. According to Strategy’s official statement , this turnaround is directly tied to the company’s decision to value its crypto assets at fair market price under new accounting rules. The company also logged $10.02 billion in net income, up from a $102.6 million net loss the year prior. Diluted earnings per share reached $32.60, blowing past all historical performance. Strategy’s total Bitcoin holding stood at 628,791 BTC, bought at a cost of $46.07 billion. The average cost per coin sits around $73,277, and the company’s BTC is now worth far more than that based on current market prices. Bitcoin lifts income and updated yearly targets Phong Le, Strategy’s President and CEO, confirmed the numbers are a direct result of the firm’s aggressive crypto accumulation. “We expanded our bitcoin holdings to 628,791 bitcoins, raised over $10 billion through our ATM programs and IPOs, and saw growing institutional and retail demand for our securities,” Phong said. He added that Strategy’s Bitcoin per Share (BPS) climbed 25% year-to-date, prompting the firm to revise its BTC Yield target from 25% to 30%, and its BTC $ Gain projection from $15 billion to $20 billion by year’s end. He explained that fair value gains from Bitcoin pushed Q2 operating income to $14 billion and that the firm expects $34 billion in operating income and $24 billion in net income for the full year. The company is also forecasting $80 in EPS, predicting that Bitcoin reaches $150,000 by December. The crypto gain for Q2 alone stood at $9.5 billion, with the company holding 597,325 bitcoin as of June 30. These were valued at $64.4 billion, with a cost basis of $42.4 billion. An additional 31,466 BTC was acquired between July 1 and July 29. Strategy said it booked a $14 billion fair value gain in Q2, compared to a $180 million impairment loss using the old cost-based accounting system last year. Capital programs boost liquidity for Bitcoin buys Strategy brought in over $10.5 billion in fresh cash in Q2 and July through stock sales, with nearly half of it raised via its common stock ATM program. The company sold 14.2 million shares between April and June, raising $5.2 billion, and another 2.4 million shares in July for $1.1 billion. As of July 29, there’s still $17 billion worth of shares that can be sold under this program. The firm also leaned heavily on four preferred stock instruments: STRK, STRF, STRD, and STRC. It raised $446.9 million from selling STRK shares in Q2 and another $71.8 million in July. For STRF, the numbers were $163.1 million in Q2 and $55.8 million in July. The IPO of STRD in May pulled in $979.7 million, and another $17.9 million came in through the STRD ATM in July. In total, the STRD ATM still has $4.2 billion left unissued. Then in July, the company launched STRC and raised $2.5 billion through its IPO. Outside of crypto, Strategy’s software business reported $114.5 million in total revenue for Q2, a 2.7% increase from last year. The biggest growth came from subscription services, which climbed 69.5% year-over-year to $40.8 million. Gross profit for the quarter was $78.7 million, giving the segment a 68.8% gross margin, slightly below last year’s 72.2%. Strategy closed Q2 with $50.1 million in cash, up from $38.1 million at the end of 2024. For the rest of 2025, Strategy said it expects to hit its revised Bitcoin goals through a mix of preferred stock offerings and common stock issuance, guided by mNAV thresholds. The company said this approach would grow its bitcoin wallet without exposing shareholders to unnecessary dilution. Strategy also noted that because of its large crypto holdings and the use of fair value accounting, its earnings are highly sensitive to Bitcoin’s market price.

This isn’t a fantasy; it’s the latest reality for Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy. Their audacious commitment to Bitcoin continues to yield remarkable results, positioning them as a unique player in both the corporate and cryptocurrency landscapes. The firm’s recent Q2 2025 report highlights an astounding period of growth, largely fueled by the surging value of its MicroStrategy Bitcoin holdings. This isn’t just about profit; it’s about a pioneering corporate treasury strategy that is redefining how companies view their balance sheets. The Astounding Success of MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings According to a recent report by Wu Blockchain on X, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has reported an eye-popping $10 billion in net income for Q2 2025. This colossal figure underscores the profound impact that Bitcoin’s price appreciation has had on the company’s financial health. For a firm primarily known for its business intelligence software, this pivot to becoming a de facto Bitcoin holding company has paid off handsomely, demonstrating an unprecedented level of conviction in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t just a one-off gain; it’s the culmination of a deliberate and consistent strategy initiated years ago. Strategy’s decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset was, at the time, seen by many as highly unconventional, even risky. Yet, under the guidance of its visionary leadership, the company has steadfastly accumulated Bitcoin, transforming its balance sheet and delivering substantial value to shareholders. The Q2 profit is a testament to the long-term potential of a bold MicroStrategy Bitcoin investment strategy. Why is MicroStrategy Investing So Heavily in Bitcoin? The question on many minds remains: why such an unwavering commitment to Bitcoin? Strategy’s rationale is multifaceted and deeply rooted in a macroeconomic outlook that sees traditional fiat currencies depreciating over time. Here are the core reasons driving their aggressive MicroStrategy Bitcoin accumulation: Inflation Hedge: The company views Bitcoin as a superior store of value, a digital gold that can protect corporate assets from inflationary pressures and currency debasement. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Strategy believes Bitcoin is in its early stages of adoption and will continue to appreciate significantly as it becomes a global reserve asset and a primary means of wealth transfer. Capital Allocation Efficiency: Rather than holding cash that loses purchasing power, the company opts to convert excess capital into a scarce, decentralized asset with perceived long-term growth potential. Pioneering Institutional Adoption: By being the first publicly traded company to make such a significant commitment, Strategy aims to set a precedent and encourage other corporations to consider Bitcoin for their treasury reserves. This strategic foresight has not only propelled their own growth but has also played a crucial role in legitimizing Bitcoin as a serious asset class for institutional investors worldwide. Their transparent and consistent approach to acquiring MicroStrategy Bitcoin has made them a bellwether for corporate crypto adoption. Understanding MicroStrategy’s Bold $4.2 Billion Raise The firm’s commitment isn’t just about holding existing assets; it’s about active expansion. Strategy has announced plans to raise an additional $4.2 billion through the issuance of STRC perpetual preferred stock. The explicit purpose of this massive capital raise? To buy more Bitcoin. This move signals an incredibly bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s future price trajectory and reinforces their ‘Bitcoin maximalist’ stance. The scale of their ambition is evident in their recent acquisition spree. In Q2 alone, Strategy significantly expanded its Bitcoin portfolio: Start of Q2 Holdings: Approximately 499,000 BTC End of Q2 Holdings: Approximately 597,000 BTC Total Holdings (Post-Q2 acquisitions mentioned): An astounding 628,800 BTC To put this into perspective, Strategy’s total holdings of 628,800 BTC represent roughly 3% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. This makes them, by far, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, dwarfing even some institutional funds. The planned $4.2 billion raise will only solidify their position as the leading corporate proponent of MicroStrategy Bitcoin adoption. What Does This Mean for the Future of MicroStrategy and Bitcoin?

Strategy’s ongoing Bitcoin strategy has profound implications for both the company itself and the broader cryptocurrency market. For Strategy, its stock performance has become increasingly correlated with Bitcoin’s price movements, effectively transforming it into a proxy for Bitcoin exposure in traditional equity marke"

2025-07-31 21:41:36+00:00,Strategy Bets Big: $4.2B STRC Offering Targets Massive Bitcoin Purchase,"Bitcoin heavyweight Strategy has launched a fresh $4.2 billion at-the-market (ATM) equity program for its STRC preferred shares, deepening its commitment to an aggressive equity-to-Bitcoin acquisition strategy. The filing , submitted to the SEC and announced late Thursday, follows the company’s strongest quarterly performance on record and comes amid a sharp expansion of its Bitcoin treasury. Strategy Announces $4.2 Billion STRC At-The-Market Program https://t.co/4wOYjw8B2u — Michael Saylor (@saylor) July 31, 2025 The STRC program, designed for Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, provides Strategy with the flexibility to raise capital over time, depending on market conditions. Proceeds from the offering are expected to be channeled into general corporate purposes, including working capital and dividends on previously issued preferred shares. However, consistent with Strategy’s stated objectives, a major portion is anticipated to be allocated directly to purchasing additional Bitcoin . The move builds on the momentum of four other ATM programs already in operation. Each has allowed Strategy to convert investor capital into digital assets, reinforcing CEO Michael Saylor’s long-standing belief in Bitcoin as a superior corporate treasury asset. The firm’s filing indicates its intent to continue leveraging equity markets to support its expanding crypto strategy, which now spans multiple asset classes and preferred share structures. Saylor’s Strategy: Profits, BTC, and Scalable Capital Programs Amid Soaring Equity Demand Strategy’s second-quarter earnings report , released just after the STRC announcement, showed a sharp rise in profitability. Net income surged to over $2.3 billion, driven by unrealized gains on Bitcoin holdings during a quarter when the price of BTC soared above $110,000. This represented a nearly 140% increase from Q1, indicating the material impact of the company’s digital asset position on its bottom line. Source: Strategy Its Bitcoin holdings, which stood at 628,212 BTC as of July 29, are currently valued at roughly $69.4 billion. This includes a recent purchase of 14,620 BTC disclosed earlier this week, acquired using proceeds raised through existing ATM equity programs. SEC filings show that between July 14 and July 20, Strategy raised over $740 million by selling multiple classes of shares, a mix of common and preferred. Strategy’s momentum is also visible in its capital markets activity, which has generated more than $10.5 billion in gross proceeds in just the last four months. Between April and the end of June, the company secured $6.8 billion through multiple stock issuance programs. An additional $3.7 billion was raised between July 1 and July 29 across both public offerings and ATM facilities. A sizable portion of that capital is already being recycled into Bitcoin. The largest tranche came from Strategy’s Common Stock ATM Program, which brought in over $6.3 billion during that time frame through the issuance of nearly 16.7 million shares. Even after those sales, $17 billion remains authorized under its May 2025 common equity program. In addition to common equity, Strategy is leveraging preferred shares across several new products. Its STRK ATM program generated over $518 million during the same period, while the STRF ATM program raised approximately $219 million. The company’s May IPO of STRD stock added $979 million, and its follow-up STRD ATM launch in July has raised $17.9 million so far, with $4.2 billion still available. @MicroStrategy doubles down, acquiring 21,021 #Bitcoin after closing the largest U.S. IPO of 2025 worth $2.52B with its new STRC preferred stock. #Startegy #Bitcoin https://t.co/BNc5V6UfhF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 29, 2025 STRC itself also saw a strong cash infusion even before the ATM program was announced.

2025-07-31 21:45:30+00:00,Algorand Foundation releases its roadmap for 2025 and 2026,"Algorand Foundation has released its roadmap for 2025 onwards with plans to launch new infrastructural products in the coming years. The foundation stated that the roadmap is part of its efforts to boost real-world blockchain adoption. According to the press release from the foundation, its new roadmap will focus on four key areas, including simplifying user experience and accelerating innovation to deliver constant upgrades to the network. It noted that part of the innovation will focus on enabling use cases that support stablecoins, tokenizations, and AI agents while improving the network security and privacy standards to be quantum-resistant. Speaking on its plans, Algorand Foundation CEO Staci Warden noted the new roadmap is all about Algorand building the right infrastructure for the future on-chain economy. She said: “This roadmap lays the groundwork to onboard a new generation of people and enterprises that need the blockchain-based products of the future, but that don’t need to know what a blockchain is or how it works under the hood.” Meanwhile, the Foundation’s principal engineer, Bruno Martins, noted that the roadmap focuses on developers and builders. According to him, the core goal is to make it easy to deploy and use projects on the Algorand network, and he expects more builders to launch on the protocol. Algorand plans major product releases for 2025 and 2026 Interestingly, Algorand already has a slate of products set for release between Q3 of 2025 and Q4 of 2026. According to the foundation, these products will address its core goals for the next few years. One such product is xGov Governance, an on-chain community governance framework set to launch by Q3 of 2024. The framework is expected to be used for allocations of grants on the network, starting with an xGov council before full implementation in 2026. Beyond that, the foundation plans to improve developers’ experience by launching AlgoKit 4.0 in the first half of 2026. This software development kit (SDK) is expected to enable easy deployment on Algorand with new SDKs for programming languages such as Kotlin, Swift, and Rust, in addition to Python and Typescript, which Algorand already supports. Other planned products include a self-custody wallet, Rocca Wallet, set for full launch in the first half of 2026, and Agentic Security and Identity Framework that will allow AI agents to execute on-chain transactions on Algorand. The foundation added that it will further beef up institutional compatibility by launching Intermezzo, a custodial solution for businesses integrating blockchain technology. With the tool, released in Q3 of 2025, enterprises can use Algorand for treasuries, loyalty programs, and other business models. WorldChess has already adopted it for its on-chain loyalty program. ALGO sinks further Meanwhile, the roadmap release has not had much impact on the Algorand native token ALGO’s performance. While many people were excited about the roadmap ahead of its release, ALGO is down almost 1% in the last 24 hours and has lost 6% of its value in the past week. Its price decline today coincides with the general market struggles, with Bitcoin falling to $116,500 range after trading as high as above $118,900 earlier in the day. With BTC’s decline, almost all other major cap assets have also fallen in value, with ETH and SOL down by around 1% each. However, ALGO struggles extend beyond today’s performance, given that the token, which is trading at $0.25, is down by 33.36% year-to-date. Its poor performance is more pronounced when compared with its peak price of $3.56 back in 2019, showing it is 93% down from its all-time high. The poor performance of ALGO is likely connected to the decline in activity on Algorand. The blockchain network has slowly lost relevance compared to competitors such as Ethereum, Solana, BNB Smart Chain, Sui, Aptos, or Layer-2 networks. Per Defillama data, it has a total value locked (TVL) of $79.91 million, putting it at 49th on the list of networks with the biggest TVL, showing just how little DeFi activity happens on it. With the new roadmap, investors in ALGO will be hoping to see the Layer-1 network record a resurgence. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-31 21:55:11+00:00,Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Weakness Ahead of August Downturn,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Bitcoin Price Faces Critical Weakness Ahead of August Downturn The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting and evolving. Just when you think you’ve got a handle on its movements, a new report emerges, urging caution. Recently, 10x Research, a prominent name in crypto analytics, issued a significant warning that has caught the attention of investors worldwide: the Bitcoin price might be heading for a period of notable weakness, particularly as we approach the historically challenging month of August. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s backed by seasonal trends and a closer look at on-chain capital flows, painting a nuanced picture of what could be ahead for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Is the Bitcoin Price Headed for a Summer Slump? Markus Thielen, the astute lead analyst at 10x Research, has highlighted a compelling historical pattern concerning the Bitcoin price in August. His research indicates that this particular month has, more often than not, been Bitcoin’s weakest performer. We’re talking about significant pullbacks, with most years experiencing losses ranging from 5% to a substantial 20%. This isn’t just a recent phenomenon; it’s a recurring theme in Bitcoin’s volatile history. While the crypto market is known for its unpredictable swings, understanding these seasonal tendencies can provide investors with a valuable edge. What makes August so challenging for the Bitcoin price ? While no single factor is definitive, several theories exist. Historically, August falls within the summer holiday period in many parts of the world, leading to decreased trading activity and potentially lower liquidity. This ‘summer lull’ can make the market more susceptible to larger price movements on lower volume. Additionally, institutional investors and whales might reduce their activity, contributing to less buying pressure. Thielen’s analysis reinforces the idea that ignoring these historical patterns could be a costly mistake for those invested in Bitcoin. Unpacking the On-Chain Inflow Puzzle: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Price? Beyond seasonal trends, 10x Research’s report delves into another critical metric: on-chain capital flows. These flows represent the movement of funds into and out of the Bitcoin network, offering insights into investor sentiment and demand. Alarmingly, the report points to a decline in these inflows. The 30-day rolling average of capital flows has dipped from $62.4 billion to $59.3 billion. This reduction isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals a potential shift in market dynamics, suggesting that the influx of new capital, which typically fuels upward price momentum, is slowing down. CoinDesk reported on these findings, emphasizing that a decline in on-chain inflows often precedes or accompanies a consolidation phase for the Bitcoin price . While Bitcoin has seen impressive total inflows, exceeding $1 trillion, with a significant $206 billion flowing in during 2024 alone, Thielen notes that the price impact has been ""surprisingly muted."" This observation raises a crucial question: if such massive capital is entering the ecosystem, why isn’t the Bitcoin price reacting with the explosive gains many expect? This disconnect could indicate that existing holders are selling into strength, or that the new capital is being absorbed without creating significant upward pressure, casting shadows of doubt on immediate further upside potential. Navigating Potential Support Levels: Where Could the Bitcoin Price Find Stability? Understanding potential downside risks is crucial for risk management. The 10x Research report doesn’t just warn of weakness; it also provides specific price targets for potential support levels, offering a roadmap for investors to consider. According to Thielen’s projections, a breakdown below the $117,000 mark for the Bitcoin price could trigger further declines. Should this level fail to hold, the next significant support is identified around $112,000. For a deeper correction, the report suggests a range between $106,000 and $110,000 as a potential consolidation zone. These levels are not arbitrary; they often correspond to previous areas of significant trading activity, psychological barriers, or technical indicators. Investors and traders typically watch these support zones closely, as they can represent opportunities for accumulation or areas where selling pressure might temporarily abate. Preparing for these scenarios allows market participants to make informed decisions rather than reacting impulsively to market volatility. Historical Resilience: Can Bitcoin Price Defy August’s Curse? Despite the ominous warnings, there’s a silver lining that bulls might cling to. Markus Thielen himself acknowledged that August hasn’t always been a losing month for the Bitcoin price , especially during post-halving bull markets.

BDO, a global accounting firm, reviewed the report. BDO confirmed that Tether’s financial records are accurate and that tangible assets fully back its USDT stablecoin. It also shows that the company is growing steadily and gaining more trust around the world as a reliable digital dollar provider. USDT Demand Soars, Backed by $127B in U.S. Treasuries As revealed by the financial report, Tether issued over $13.4 billion in new USDT during Q2 2025. This brings the total stablecoin in circulation to over $157 billion, a $20 billion increase since the start of the year. The steady rise in demand shows that USDT is seeing constant widespread adoption . In many regions, the stablecoin is seen as a key tool for payments, savings, and financial inclusion. This is especially in areas with limited or no access to traditional banking services. Furthermore, Tether’s investment in the U.S. Treasuries has grown to over $127 billion, with more than $105 billion held directly. This makes Tether one of the largest holders of U.S. government debt in the world. These strong reserves give users safe and reliable access to U.S. dollar liquidity on digital platforms. Tether Doubles Down on Growth with Bold U.S. Investments Tether maintained solid financial health in Q2 2025, with shareholder capital steady at $5.47 billion. This capital base serves as a safety cushion, helping the company stay strong during market uncertainty. The stablecoin issuer also reported a $4.9 billion profit for the quarter, bringing total H1 earnings to $5.7 billion. This includes $3.1 billion in revenues from daily operations and $2.6 billion investments from gold and Bitcoin (BTC). Instead of holding back profits, Tether increased investments in long-term projects like XXI Capital and Rumble Wallet. Additionally, nearly $4 billion was directed toward U.S.-based infrastructure and innovative projects. Tether Powers Payments in Over 150 Countries As more people around the world look for stable digital assets, Tether remains a top choice. USDT is now used in over 150 countries. In many regions, the digital currency is used for everyday spending and sending money across borders. Tether’s Q2 2025 report shows that its assets are still greater than its liabilities and that all its reserves are fully backed. The company also holds investments in sectors like entertainment industry , artificial intelligence, agriculture, and clean energy. Notably, these are separate from the reserves that support USDT. In a recent statement, CEO Paolo Ardoino said the second quarter results show growing trust in Tether as a stable and scalable digital dollar solution.

The steady rise in demand shows that USDT is seeing constant widespread adoption . In many regions, the stablecoin is seen as a key tool for payments, savings, and financial inclusion. This is especially in areas with limited or no access to traditional banking services. Furthermore, Tether’s investment in the U.S. Treasuries has grown to over $127 billion, with more than $105 billion held directly. This makes Tether one of the largest holders of U.S. government debt in the world. These strong reserves give users safe and reliable access to U.S. dollar liquidity on digital platforms. Tether Doubles Down on Growth with Bold U.S. Investments Tether maintained solid financial health in Q2 2025, with shareholder capital steady at $5.47 billion. This capital base serves as a safety cushion, helping the company stay strong during market uncertainty. The stablecoin issuer also reported a $4.9 billion profit for the quarter, bringing total H1 earnings to $5.7 billion. This includes $3.1 billion in revenues from daily operations and $2.6 billion investments from gold and Bitcoin (BTC). Instead of holding back profits, Tether increased investments in long-term projects like XXI Capital and Rumble Wallet. Additionally, nearly $4 billion was directed toward U.S.-based infrastructure and innovative projects. Tether Powers Payments in Over 150 Countries As more people around the world look for stable digital assets, Tether remains a top choice. USDT is now used in over 150 countries. In many regions, the digital currency is used for everyday spending and sending money across borders. Tether’s Q2 2025 report shows that its assets are still greater than its liabilities and that all its reserves are fully backed. The company also holds investments in sectors like entertainment industry , artificial intelligence, agriculture, and clean energy. Notably, these are separate from the reserves that support USDT. In a recent statement, CEO Paolo Ardoino said the second quarter results show growing trust in Tether as a stable and scalable digital dollar solution.

2025-07-31 22:00:26+00:00,Crypto In The Courtroom—2025 Class Actions Could Hit All-Time High,"According to a report by Cornerstone on Wednesday, investors in the US have filed six class-action lawsuits tied to crypto so far in 2025. That number nearly matches the seven brought all of last year. Meanwhile, AI-related suits are closing in on last year’s total too. Surge In Crypto Lawsuits In the first half of 2025, six crypto-related filings went to court. That is a big jump from seven for all of 2024. Half of those new suits target token issuers. One is against a mining company. Two more name outfits that sell rigs or have crypto partnerships. The law firm Burwick Law filed three of the six cases. Its founder, Max Burwick, says private suits give investors a clear way to hold firms to account. Pomerantz LLP and Glancy Prongay & Murray led the rest of the filings. AI Cases On The Rise Based on a report , 12 AI-related lawsuits hit US courts in the same period. Last year saw 15 in total. Stanford law professor Joseph Grundfest points to “AI-washing” as the main culprit. That’s when companies overstate their AI skills to grab investor cash. Investors strike back with civil claims once the truth comes out and share prices slide. Total filings in H1 2025 for all securities cases stood at 114. That figure is almost flat compared to 115 in H2 2024. It shows that lawsuits driven by hot themes are rising fast, while overall litigation stays steady. Regulatory Pullback Drives Private Action Investors did not wait for regulators to move. Even after US agencies like the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission eased up on crypto under US President Donald Trump, suits kept coming. That pattern suggests civil actions are now part of the playbook for those who feel burned by sudden losses. Looking at the data, last year’s seven crypto suits are on course to be beaten by 2025’s total. And AI filings look set to match or exceed the 15 logged in 2024. Both areas have a small group of law firms leading the charge. Burwick Law stands out for crypto. On the AI side, a variety of firms are jumping in. What Companies Should Watch Companies working with crypto or AI must be precise in how they talk about their tech. Overblown claims or careless wording on blockchain ties or machine-learning breakthroughs could invite civil suits. Clear, honest disclosures are the best defense. Legal experts warn that private lawsuits can pick up where regulators leave off.

2025-07-31 22:15:10+00:00,Bitcoin Mining Giant Riot Platforms Achieves Stunning Q2 Profit Amidst Rising Costs,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mining Giant Riot Platforms Achieves Stunning Q2 Profit Amidst Rising Costs The world of cryptocurrency is a fascinating blend of innovation, volatility, and significant financial plays. Few companies embody this dynamic landscape quite like Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), a prominent player in the Bitcoin mining sector. Recently, the company turned heads with its Q2 financial report, revealing a stunning $219.5 million net income. This impressive rebound from a previous loss has sparked considerable discussion across the digital asset community. But what exactly drove this dramatic shift, especially when the underlying costs of Bitcoin mining are on a significant upward trend? Let’s delve into the intricate details of Riot’s performance and explore the broader implications for the future of digital gold. Understanding Riot Platforms’ Remarkable Q2 Performance in Bitcoin Mining Riot Platforms’ Q2 2023 financial results present a compelling narrative of strategic positioning and market dynamics. The reported net income of $219.5 million marks a significant turnaround from the $296.4 million net loss experienced in Q1. This dramatic swing wasn’t primarily due to a massive increase in operational mining profits but rather a powerful accounting mechanism: an unrealized gain on its substantial Bitcoin holdings. Imagine holding a valuable asset that suddenly appreciates significantly in market value – that’s precisely what happened for Riot with its Bitcoin reserves. Specifically, a staggering $470.8 million unrealized gain on its Bitcoin holdings was the primary catalyst for this financial rebound. It’s crucial to understand the distinction here: an “unrealized gain” means the company hasn’t sold the Bitcoin yet. The profit exists on paper, reflecting the increased market value of their assets. While this is a positive indicator of asset appreciation, it doesn’t represent cash flow from operations directly. This nuance is vital for investors to grasp, as it highlights the company’s dual role as both a Bitcoin mining operator and a significant holder of the asset itself. Despite this impressive quarterly profit, the year-to-date net loss for Riot Platforms still stands at $76.9 million. This figure provides a more holistic view of their financial journey throughout the year, indicating that while Q2 was strong, the earlier part of the year presented significant challenges. This underlines the inherent volatility and capital-intensive nature of the Bitcoin mining industry, where profitability can fluctuate wildly based on market prices, energy costs, and mining difficulty. The Double-Edged Sword: Rising Bitcoin Mining Costs While the Q2 profit is certainly headline-grabbing, a critical detail often overshadowed is the substantial increase in Bitcoin mining costs. Riot Platforms reported a staggering 93% year-over-year rise in these operational expenses. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a significant indicator of the increasing pressures faced by miners across the globe. What factors contribute to such a dramatic surge in costs? Several key elements are at play: Energy Prices: Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process. As global energy markets have seen volatility, particularly with rising electricity prices, the operational costs for miners like Riot have directly escalated. Network Difficulty: The Bitcoin network adjusts its mining difficulty approximately every two weeks. As more miners join and more powerful hardware comes online, the difficulty increases. This means miners need to expend more computational power to find a block and earn Bitcoin, effectively increasing the cost per Bitcoin mined. Hardware Upgrades and Maintenance: To remain competitive, miners must constantly invest in the latest, most efficient mining hardware (ASICs). These machines are expensive, and their maintenance and eventual replacement contribute significantly to overall costs. Infrastructure and Personnel: Beyond the direct mining operation, companies like Riot also incur costs for maintaining their large-scale data centers, cooling systems, security, and a growing team of engineers and operational staff. To illustrate the impact, consider a simplified breakdown of typical Bitcoin mining costs: Cost Category Description Impact on Profitability Electricity Primary operational expense for mining rigs and cooling. Directly correlated with energy market prices; higher prices squeeze margins. Hardware Depreciation/Upgrades Cost of acquiring and maintaining ASICs. Significant capital expenditure; efficiency gains are crucial. Hosting/Infrastructure Data center space, cooling, internet, security. Fixed and variable costs; scales with mining capacity. Personnel Salaries for engineers, technicians, management. Essential for large-scale operations.

2025-07-31 22:30:00+00:00,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 31 July – XRP, Cardano, Pi Coin","With original crypto Bitcoin trading just 3.5% down from its recent all-time high (ATH) price of $122,838 just over two weeks ago, hopes are running high for a new bull run to eclipse the famous 2021 gold rush. This prolonged period of optimism has helped drive growth among several prominent altcoins and some of the best meme coins . Over the past year, coins like XRP, TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have each experienced historic price surges, indicating the possibility of a market-wide rally on the horizon. As momentum builds for a prolonged bull cycle, investors are increasingly eyeing tokens with the potential to exceed their historical price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Global Remittance Crypto Outperforms Bitcoin in Price Performance This Year On July 18, Ripple’s XRP token set a new record by reaching $3.65, breaking past its former 2018 high of $3.40. Though it has since dipped to around $3.17—a decrease of 13.2% from its peak—XRP remains up 43% over the past month. It appears to be stabilizing in a consolidation phase, but continued investor interest suggests another rally may be in the works. XRP’s appeal among institutional investors is fueled by its fast transaction settlement, minimal fees, and cross-border utility without requiring intermediaries. Even organizations such as the United Nations have shown interest in the technology. Following a lengthy legal battle, Ripple achieved a key win in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that its retail transactions didn’t qualify as securities sales. By 2025, with the SEC concluding its case, this legal clarity will have further strengthened investor trust in the asset. This favorable regulatory backdrop has resulted in strong capital inflows, contributing to a staggering 388% annual gain, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 79% increase over the same timeframe. XRP’s RSI has decreased from an overheated 86 at the start of last week to a more moderate 54, indicating that some traders are taking profits. This shift may lead to additional short-term selling pressure into the weekend, creating an opportunity for strategic accumulation. In the last 24 hours, XRP has added 1.8% going against the trend of the collective crypto market, which dipped 3.6% overnight to $3.97 trillion. While further downside is possible until the RSI nears a neutral 50, strong support appears to be forming around the previous resistance level of $3. A bullish flag pattern that formed from late 2024 to early April points to the potential for another breakout—possibly sending XRP to $4 by fall. Cardano (ADA): Will the Eco-Friendly Ethereum Alternative Crypto Reach New Price Highs in 2025? Cardano ($ADA) has gained renewed traction, jumping 39% over the past month. This rise is supported by bullish technical signs and growing institutional interest.

Created in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is known for its academically driven development model and sustainable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus—a concept that influenced Ethereum’s transition away from energy-intensive mining.

Recent price action has revealed a bullish flag pattern, indicating further gains. However, ADA’s RSI has cooled from a recent peak of 85 to 54, showing signs of steady profit-taking while again mirroring XRP’s trajectory. Taken altogether, this hints at the potential for a lot more ADA bullishness before the New Year. The next big resistance level is near $1.15, while solid support is holding between $0.85 and $0.90.

With original crypto Bitcoin trading just 3.5% down from its recent all-time high (ATH) price of $122,838 just over two weeks ago, hopes are running high for a new bull run to eclipse the famous 2021 gold rush. This prolonged period of optimism has helped drive growth among several prominent altcoins and some of the best meme coins . Over the past year, coins like XRP, TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have each experienced historic price surges, indicating the possibility of a market-wide rally on the horizon. As momentum builds for a prolonged bull cycle, investors are increasingly eyeing tokens with the potential to exceed their historical price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Global Remittance Crypto Outperforms Bitcoin in Price Performance This Year On July 18, Ripple’s XRP token set a new record by reaching $3.65, breaking past its former 2018 high of $3.40. Though it has since dipped to around $3.17—a decrease of 13.2% from its peak—XRP remains up 43% over the past month. It appears to be stabilizing in a consolidation phase, but continued investor interest suggests another rally may be in the works. XRP’s appeal among institutional investors is fueled by its fast transaction settlement, minimal fees, and cross-border utility without requiring intermediaries. Even organizations such as the United Nations have shown interest in the technology. Following a lengthy legal battle, Ripple achieved a key win in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that its retail transactions didn’t qualify as securities sales. By 2025, with the SEC concluding its case, this legal clarity will have further strengthened investor trust in the asset. This favorable regulatory backdrop has resulted in strong capital inflows, contributing to a staggering 388% annual gain, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 79% increase over the same timeframe. XRP’s RSI has decreased from an overheated 86 at the start of last week to a more moderate 54, indicating that some traders are taking profits. This shift may lead to additional short-term selling pressure into the weekend, creating an opportunity for strategic accumulation. In the last 24 hours, XRP has added 1.8% going against the trend of the collective crypto market, which dipped 3.6% overnight to $3.97 trillion. While further downside is possible until the RSI nears a neutral 50, strong support appears to be forming around the previous resistance level of $3. A bullish flag pattern that formed from late 2024 to early April points to the potential for another breakout—possibly sending XRP to $4 by fall. Cardano (ADA): Will the Eco-Friendly Ethereum Alternative Crypto Reach New Price Highs in 2025? Cardano ($ADA) has gained renewed traction, jumping 39% over the past month. This rise is supported by bullish technical signs and growing institutional interest. Alongside XRP and Solana, ADA was mentioned by President Donald Trump as a candidate for inclusion in a proposed national crypto reserve. Created in 2014 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano is known for its academically driven development model and sustainable Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus—a concept that influenced Ethereum’s transition away from energy-intensive mining.

2025-07-31 23:00:50+00:00,"4 Top Cryptos to Watch Now With Real Utility:  BlockDAG, Hyperliquid, Cardano, & Dogecoin!","As the crypto space enters another critical phase, enthusiasts are asking the same question: which are the top cryptos to watch now? While many assets are circulating, only a few display a strong mix of growth, real-world use, and positive traction. The spotlight is now on select coins that are making significant moves through tech updates, adoption, or presale strength. Among them, BlockDAG has turned heads with one of the biggest presale stories to date. Below are four coins that stand out from the rest this month. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG) Rising attention surrounds BlockDAG (BDAG) as the spotlight remains fixed on August 11, the date of its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. This day will see the closing of its 10 BTC Auction, the announcement of winners, and the rollout of the GLOBAL LAUNCH update, a combination that adds momentum to the presale’s conclusion. Many see it as a rare alignment of timing, community interest, and platform development. BlockDAG has so far pulled in $357 million in presale funding, placing it among the highest earners this cycle. A total of 24.5 billion BDAG coins have already been sold, and current sales are running in Batch 29 at a price of $0.0016, which is available until August 11. Since Batch 1, early participants have already seen their funds grow by 2,660%. These gains are fueling even more attention ahead of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. BlockDAG isn’t only relying on sales buzz. The project has confirmed over 20 exchange listings and is supported by U.S.-based sports teams like the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. Its wide outreach across crypto, sports, and retail has driven user growth. For those searching for the top cryptos to watch now, BlockDAG currently offers a rare mix of growth, updates, and solid network backing. 2. Hyperliquid (HYPR) DeFi participants are taking note of Hyperliquid thanks to its approach to fully on-chain derivatives trading. Its structure removes centralized elements, offering users high-speed, low-fee access to permissionless markets, an appealing combination for advanced crypto users and developers. The recent rollout of its native HYPR token has added further appeal. With early positive performance, the platform is now seeing steady adoption. Liquidity-based rewards and governance models are pulling more users in, especially as institutions look to enter more technical DeFi setups. Though not as headline-driven as BlockDAG, Hyperliquid shows promise through clear fundamentals. From a DeFi infrastructure view, it ranks high among the top cryptos to watch now, especially for those who prefer substance over hype. 3. Cardano (ADA) Among the coins known for academic and security-first development, Cardano remains a strong contender. Recent updates, including the Chang Hard Fork, have strengthened the network’s decentralization, offering developers more tools to build on ADA’s ecosystem. The growing number of DeFi projects and rising transaction activity add relevance to ADA’s current position. With renewed interest from large holders, the coin may enter a slow but steady upward phase in the near term. Even though BlockDAG is currently seeing faster momentum, Cardano continues to appeal to long-term crypto watchers. For those viewing the market from a value-building standpoint, ADA remains one of the top cryptos to watch now. 4. Dogecoin (DOGE) Meme coins may seem like yesterday’s news, but Dogecoin continues to attract attention with its unique combination of social media backing and real-world presence. It maintains availability across nearly all major exchanges and benefits from ongoing mainstream visibility. DOGE’s movements are often tied to sentiment, influencer activity, and short-term hype cycles. This makes it volatile but still valuable for those who understand its timing-based potential. It’s not about tech innovation, it’s about brand power and staying relevant. Despite its unpredictable nature, Dogecoin remains a major player. With rumors of new integrations occasionally driving surges, it still qualifies as one of the top cryptos to watch now for those interested in short-term moves. Final Thoughts on the Top Cryptos to Watch Now Each project stands out for a specific reason: Dogecoin thrives on viral appeal, Cardano emphasizes solid fundamentals, and Hyperliquid develops advanced tools for on-chain trading. Meanwhile, BlockDAG brings together strategic marketing, perfect timing, real utility, and strong community backing in one focused launch plan. With the 10 BTC Auction, $357 million in presale funds, and its GLOBAL LAUNCH release all set for August 11, BDAG is firmly in the spotlight. While your choice may vary based on personal goals, BlockDAG currently presents one of the strongest cases among the top cryptos to watch now .

2025-07-31 23:01:23+00:00,JPMorgan Spots Ripple’s Potential to Disrupt Traditional Payment Systems,"Crypto researcher SMQKE published a post on X highlighting internal JPMorgan material that explicitly references Ripple as a viable blockchain solution for solving global interoperability and data challenges in the financial system. According to the visuals shared, JPMorgan appears to acknowledge Ripple’s technological infrastructure as a means of enabling secure, low-cost, and fast cross-border transfers, underlining the company’s capability to interconnect disparate financial systems. One slide in the shared document, carrying the JPMorgan watermark, features Ripple as an example of blockchain-based processing. It states that Ripple utilizes a cloud-based ledger to facilitate international fund transfers while leveraging existing financial infrastructure. The diagram in the slide explains the step-by-step process of how Ripple’s network operates, including the role of a market maker that handles the currencies of both sender and receiver to complete the transaction efficiently. The flow demonstrates Ripple’s functionality in obtaining foreign exchange rates, processing payments, and enabling fast cross-border settlement between financial institutions. J.P. Morgan has identified Ripple as a blockchain-based payment network with the potential to disrupt traditional payment systems. The old guard was always paying attention. Documented. https://t.co/vMFtl2kl5e pic.twitter.com/VuhE7gd2zV — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 30, 2025 Ripple Among Customizable Global Payment Network Leaders The second slide from the presentation, also bearing the JPMorgan label, focuses on the emergence of cloud-based global payment networks. The segment titled “Disruptors” presents Ripple alongside other prominent cryptocurrency-based systems such as Bitcoin , Litecoin, and Dash. The inclusion of Ripple in this section supports the broader assessment that blockchain platforms are not just theoretical concepts but have matured into technologies with practical, scalable applications. This part of the presentation describes these networks as customized solutions addressing specific payment needs, particularly those centered on compliance and innovation. Ripple is shown as one of the blockchain networks that has already contributed to solving geographic interoperability issues. The slide emphasizes how such solutions are compliant and leverage today’s technological capabilities to deliver real-world utility, suggesting JPMorgan’s awareness of Ripple’s practical use in financial ecosystems. Francis Hadlocon Highlights Strategic Backing Behind Ripple In response to SMQKE’s post, X user Francis Hadlocon offered a perspective that reinforces the significance of Ripple’s placement in the JPMorgan material. According to Hadlocon, the institutions that handle multi-trillion-dollar movements are not investing in speculative digital assets but are instead aligning with blockchain platforms capable of moving vast sums of money efficiently. He added that Ripple is not a future entrant into the space; it is already part of the underlying architecture supporting institutional-grade finance. His remarks imply that JPMorgan’s recognition of Ripple, even if subtle, is a confirmation of its established presence in the infrastructure of modern payment systems. Documentation Reflects Legacy Institutions Monitoring Blockchain Advancements SMQKE concludes the tweet by stating that the “old guard was always paying attention,” implying that legacy financial institutions like JPMorgan have long been monitoring the evolution of blockchain technologies such as Ripple. The word “Documented” underlines that this is not a speculative assertion but a direct reference backed by corporate materials from one of the world’s largest banks. The use of Ripple in JPMorgan’s internal presentations serves as a tangible acknowledgment of the firm’s relevance in blockchain-driven financial innovation. Taken together, the information shared in SMQKE’s tweet and the slides attributed to JPMorgan provide further evidence of Ripple’s position in institutional financial strategy. The imagery and structure in the presentation identify Ripple as a blockchain-enabled payment rail recognized for its capability to address global interoperability, regulatory compliance, and transaction efficiency.

2025-07-31 23:14:12+00:00,Riot Platforms tops rival Marathon with Q2 earnings making all-time high,"Riot Platforms beat out its rival Marathon Digital in the second-quarter earnings race, reporting the strongest financials of any Bitcoin mining firm so far in 2025. The Colorado-based company published its results after the Closing Bell, showing $219.5 million in net income and $495.3 million in adjusted EBITDA. The numbers cover the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, and were disclosed alongside its full earnings presentation on the company’s website, according to a press release published via Globe Newswire. Jason Les, Riot’s Chief Executive Officer, credited the rising price of Bitcoin as a key reason behind the company’s best-ever quarter. Riot saw total revenue surge to $153 million, more than double the $70 million it posted in the same quarter last year. That leap was mostly fueled by its Bitcoin mining revenue, which hit $140.9 million, up from $55.8 million a year earlier. Bitcoin production jumps despite halving and rising mining costs Riot mined a total of 1,426 Bitcoin during the quarter, a significant jump from 844 Bitcoin mined in Q2 of 2024. But the company didn’t mine them cheaply. The average cost to mine each coin, excluding depreciation, jumped to $48,992, up from $25,329 in the same period last year. The sharp increase came after the April 2024 halving, which cut miner rewards in half, and a 45% increase in the global hash rate, which made mining more competitive and expensive. Les said Riot’s current strength is the result of years of investment in infrastructure, mining scale, and power procurement. He explained the company’s strategy revolves around what he called their “ready-for-service power portfolio,” which includes two of Riot’s major operational hubs; Rockdale and Corsicana. The company is now moving more of its available energy resources into data centers as demand for high-performance computing keeps growing. Riot recently hired Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer to lead that transition. Les described Gibbs as one of several key leadership additions meant to help the company expand into new territory beyond Bitcoin mining “We are immensely proud of our evolution over the past several years,” Les said. He said Riot is in a strong position to “maximize utilization of our significant power capacity” while still riding the Bitcoin cycle. Vertical integration and strong reserves boost Riot’s position Engineering revenue for the second quarter also rose slightly, hitting $10.6 million, compared to $9.6 million in Q2 of 2024. Riot said much of that benefit comes from its December 2021 acquisition of ESS Metron, a move that has saved the company $18.5 million in capital expenditures since then. The acquisition allowed Riot to integrate power infrastructure engineering directly into its operations, giving it tighter control over supply chains and spending. As of the end of June, Riot held 19,273 Bitcoin on its books, with 3,300 BTC held as collateral. Based on the June 30 market price of $107,174 per Bitcoin, the total value of those holdings comes out to roughly $2.1 billion. The company also reported a strong cash position, with $255.4 million in unrestricted cash, $74.9 million in restricted cash, and $62.5 million in marketable securities. That brought Riot’s working capital to $141.1 million. Despite the huge quarter, Riot’s stock dropped 0.81% in after-hours trading. The company gave no explanation for the dip, and no executives commented on it during the release. Investors may have already priced in the earnings or reacted to broader crypto market movements, but the drop came immediately after the announcement.

The Colorado-based company published its results after the Closing Bell, showing $219.5 million in net income and $495.3 million in adjusted EBITDA. The numbers cover the three-month period ending June 30, 2025, and were disclosed alongside its full earnings presentation on the company’s website, according to a press release published via Globe Newswire. Jason Les, Riot’s Chief Executive Officer, credited the rising price of Bitcoin as a key reason behind the company’s best-ever quarter. Riot saw total revenue surge to $153 million, more than double the $70 million it posted in the same quarter last year. That leap was mostly fueled by its Bitcoin mining revenue, which hit $140.9 million, up from $55.8 million a year earlier. Bitcoin production jumps despite halving and rising mining costs Riot mined a total of 1,426 Bitcoin during the quarter, a significant jump from 844 Bitcoin mined in Q2 of 2024. But the company didn’t mine them cheaply. The average cost to mine each coin, excluding depreciation, jumped to $48,992, up from $25,329 in the same period last year. The sharp increase came after the April 2024 halving, which cut miner rewards in half, and a 45% increase in the global hash rate, which made mining more competitive and expensive. Les said Riot’s current strength is the result of years of investment in infrastructure, mining scale, and power procurement. He explained the company’s strategy revolves around what he called their “ready-for-service power portfolio,” which includes two of Riot’s major operational hubs; Rockdale and Corsicana. The company is now moving more of its available energy resources into data centers as demand for high-performance computing keeps growing. Riot recently hired Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer to lead that transition. Les described Gibbs as one of several key leadership additions meant to help the company expand into new territory beyond Bitcoin mining “We are immensely proud of our evolution over the past several years,” Les said. He said Riot is in a strong position to “maximize utilization of our significant power capacity” while still riding the Bitcoin cycle. Vertical integration and strong reserves boost Riot’s position Engineering revenue for the second quarter also rose slightly, hitting $10.6 million, compared to $9.6 million in Q2 of 2024. Riot said much of that benefit comes from its December 2021 acquisition of ESS Metron, a move that has saved the company $18.5 million in capital expenditures since then. The acquisition allowed Riot to integrate power infrastructure engineering directly into its operations, giving it tighter control over supply chains and spending. As of the end of June, Riot held 19,273 Bitcoin on its books, with 3,300 BTC held as collateral. Based on the June 30 market price of $107,174 per Bitcoin, the total value of those holdings comes out to roughly $2.1 billion. The company also reported a strong cash position, with $255.4 million in unrestricted cash, $74.9 million in restricted cash, and $62.5 million in marketable securities. That brought Riot’s working capital to $141.1 million. Despite the huge quarter, Riot’s stock dropped 0.81% in after-hours trading. The company gave no explanation for the dip, and no executives commented on it during the release. Investors may have already priced in the earnings or reacted to broader crypto market movements, but the drop came immediately after the announcement.

Today, that volatility has once again taken center stage as Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, experienced a significant Bitcoin price drop , falling below the crucial $116,000 mark. According to market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $115,992.4 on the Binance USDT market. This latest dip has certainly sent ripples of concern and speculation throughout the investor community, prompting many to ask: what’s happening, and what does this mean for the future of crypto? What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the forces behind a Bitcoin price drop is crucial. While a single cause is rarely identifiable, several factors often converge. This recent dip could stem from macroeconomic indicators, large-scale whale movements, or technical analysis patterns. Global economic uncertainties, like inflation or interest rate hikes, often lead investors to de-risk. Regulatory news, even speculative, can also create FUD that triggers sell-offs. Furthermore, the actions of large holders, “whales,” significantly impact market dynamics. A substantial sell-off can flood the market, pushing prices down. Technically, Bitcoin might have encountered strong resistance or broken key support levels, leading to cascading liquidations. Broader negative market sentiment can also amplify a Bitcoin price drop . How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Bitcoin’s dominance means its movements often dictate the entire market. When Bitcoin experiences a significant Bitcoin price drop , altcoins typically follow, often with more exaggerated movements. This is Bitcoin’s “gravitational pull.” Investors view Bitcoin as the benchmark, and its performance influences confidence across the board. A BTC dip can lead to widespread selling pressure on other digital assets. While some altcoins might show resilience, these are exceptions during major BTC corrections. The current Bitcoin price drop highlights the interconnectedness of the crypto ecosystem. Here’s a quick look at recent Bitcoin price points: Date/Time (Approx.) Bitcoin Price (USD) Change Prior Peak (Recent) ~$120,000 – Current Trading Price $115,992.4 Significant Drop Support Level (Previous) ~$116,500 Broken This table illustrates the recent shift and the breach of a temporary support level, reinforcing current bearish sentiment. Navigating the Volatility: Strategies After a Bitcoin Price Drop For investors, a sudden Bitcoin price drop can be unsettling. However, it also presents an opportunity to reassess strategies. Panic selling is rarely optimal. Instead, consider these actionable insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Thoroughly research market conditions, assets, and influencing news. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of price. This mitigates buying at peaks and is effective during a Bitcoin price drop . HODL (Hold On for Dear Life): For long-term investors believing in Bitcoin’s value, holding through dips is common. Historically, Bitcoin has recovered from pullbacks. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversify your portfolio. Set stop-loss orders to limit losses. Market cycles are natural. Understanding them and having a predefined strategy helps you remain calm and rational during intense volatility, such as a significant Bitcoin price drop . Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Buying Opportunity? The question on many minds during a significant Bitcoin price drop is whether it’s a “buy the dip” opportunity. Historically, major corrections have often led to recovery and growth. However, past performance isn’t indicative of future results. Distinguishing a true buying opportunity from a “falling knife” depends on perspective, risk tolerance, and long-term outlook. For those with strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory – its role as digital gold, increasing institutional adoption, and finite supply – a dip might be a chance to accumulate at a discount. Bitcoin’s underlying technology and network fundamentals remain strong, irrespective of short-term fluctuations. For short-term traders, such dips carry higher risks. Conduct thorough due diligence and align decisions with your financial goals and risk appetite. Evaluate market sentiment, technicals, and fundamental news to decide if this Bitcoin price drop aligns with your strategy. The current Bitcoin price drop below $116,000 serves as a powerful reminder of crypto market volatility. While alarming, such movements are characteristic of this asset class.
