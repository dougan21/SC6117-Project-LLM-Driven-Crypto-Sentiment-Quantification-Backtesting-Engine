2025-07-21 07:14:35+00:00,"XRP begins the week bullish, targets a new ATH: check forecast","July is shaping up to be one of the most bullish months for the crypto market this year. The market has opened bullish for the third consecutive week, with altcoins performing excellently. Bitcoin, the leading crypto by market cap, has been consolidating around the $118k level over the past few days. Ether hit the $3,800 mark a few hours ago while Dogecoin leads the charge. XRP has also opened the week bullish and could target a new all-time high over the next few hours or days. XRP finds key support level at $3.40 XRP, the native coin of the Ripple ecosystem, is one of the best performers among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours. The coin is up 3.5% during that period and now trades at $3.535. The positive performance comes as the broader crypto market remains extremely bullish. XRP added over 20% to its value last week, hitting a high of $3.66 for the first time in roughly eight years. XRP slightly dropped over the weekend, establishing a strong support level around $3.40. The hopes of a spot XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) and the resolution of Ripple’s case with the SEC are crucial to the inflow of institutional funds into the XRP market. Furthermore, the passing of the GENIUS Act last week was a net positive for US-based crypto projects. The regulatory clarity in the country could increase cryptocurrency adoption, resulting in higher prices for XRP and other leading coins. XRP targets a new all-time high The XRP/USD 4-hour chart is bullish but inefficient, suggesting that the coin could dip lower before rallying higher. The technical indicators are bullish following XRP’s rally over the last few days. The RSI of 66 shows that XRP is currently bullish, but not in the overbought region, indicating further room for growth. The MACD lines are also in the bullish region, suggesting a bullish bias. With XRP establishing strong support at $3,40, it could extend the rally toward last week’s high of $3.66. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP’s all-time high is $3.84, which it reached in January 2018. A successful close above last week’s high will extend the rally toward its 141.40% Fibonacci extension level at $4.10, drawn from the January high of $3.40 to the April low of $1.61. However, the market has been extremely bullish over the past few weeks and could experience some selling pressure. If that happens, XRP faces a correction and a retest of the $3.40 support level. An extended bearish run would see XRP drop to the Inducement Liquidity (ILQ) level at $3.168 over the coming hours or days.

The total crypto market cap is nearing $4 trillion, driven by rising participation. Bitcoin is trading at $118,366, up slightly in the past 24 hours, while altcoins like Ethereum, XRP, and Dogecoin are showing strong double-digit monthly gains . Despite positive developments like historic crypto bills , a tariff pause, and the Fed holding interest rates steady , some analysts warn of deeper issues forming beneath the surface. While many are preparing for a bull run, Robert Kiyosaki is preparing for a bubble burst, planning to buy more Bitcoin if prices crash. Here’s his famous Bubble Warning resurfacing again. Kiyosaki Sees All Bubble Burst Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, has once again voiced his fears of an incoming financial meltdown. In a recent X post, he warned that multiple market bubbles are about to burst. He believes that this event will not only affect stocks but will also impact assets that are often seen as safe havens, including gold, silver, and Bitcoin. BUBBLES are about to start BUSTING. When bubbles bust odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too. Good news. If prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin crash…. I will be buying. Take care. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 21, 2025 Earlier this year, Kiyosaki cheered Bitcoin’s new high above $120,000 but warned investors not to get greedy, using the phrase “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.” While he still believes in Bitcoin, gold, and silver long-term, he’s now sounding more cautious, hinting that even strong supporters are growing concerned about short-term risks as prices keep climbing. US Debt Adds to the Pressure His warning comes at a time when the US national debt has surged past $34.9 trillion. Interest payments alone are becoming one of the largest government expenses, raising serious concerns about the sustainability of the current financial system. Many believe this ballooning debt could trigger wider instability and deepen the impact of any market crash. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Charles Hoskinson Responds to ADA Misappropriation Claims with IOG Transparency Audit , Buy the Dip: Crypto May Fall Before It Rises Kiyosaki says that when the bubble pops, most asset classes, including crypto, could face a sharp correction.

2025-07-21 07:30:24+00:00,Bitcoin: H100’s Bold $1.5M Move to Boost Holdings,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: H100’s Bold $1.5M Move to Boost Holdings In the dynamic world of digital assets, a significant development is capturing the attention of investors and market observers alike: a Swedish health tech company, H100, has successfully raised 14.1 million Swedish kronor, equivalent to approximately $1.5 million, with the explicit purpose of acquiring more Bitcoin . This strategic move highlights a growing trend among corporations to integrate digital currencies into their treasury strategies, underscoring a deepening belief in the long-term value proposition of Bitcoin . Currently holding 370 BTC, H100’s decision to further expand its digital asset portfolio signals a bold step in the evolving landscape of corporate finance. Bitcoin’s Growing Appeal: Why H100 is Investing Big? The recent capital raise by H100 for additional Bitcoin acquisition isn’t just a headline; it’s a testament to the cryptocurrency’s increasing acceptance as a legitimate asset class, even within non-traditional sectors like health tech. What drives a company like H100, primarily focused on health innovation, to make such a substantial investment in Bitcoin ? The motivations are multifaceted and align with several key narratives surrounding digital assets: Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currency values, companies are increasingly looking for assets that can preserve or even grow purchasing power. Bitcoin , often dubbed “digital gold,” is seen by many as a robust hedge against inflation due to its finite supply. Digital Gold Narrative: Similar to gold, Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it an attractive store of value. Companies are diversifying their treasury reserves beyond traditional cash and bonds, viewing Bitcoin as a modern alternative. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Beyond short-term volatility, many institutional investors and corporations believe in Bitcoin’s potential for significant long-term appreciation. They view current prices as an opportune entry point for future growth. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Holding a portion of corporate reserves in Bitcoin provides diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk by introducing an asset with a low correlation to traditional financial markets. H100’s move suggests a sophisticated understanding of these underlying drivers, positioning them not just as a health tech innovator but also as a forward-thinking entity in corporate finance. The Strategic Play: How H100’s Bitcoin Acquisition Fits In? For H100, this $1.5 million capital raise isn’t merely about buying more Bitcoin ; it’s about making a strategic statement and strengthening their financial foundation. The decision to publicly announce this intent, as reported by market observers, adds a layer of transparency and confidence to their digital asset strategy. Their existing holding of 370 BTC already places them among a select group of companies with significant cryptocurrency exposure. Expanding this position indicates: Commitment to Digital Assets: It signals a long-term commitment to Bitcoin as a core component of their treasury strategy, rather than a speculative short-term venture. Confidence in Future Growth: By increasing their holdings, H100 is effectively voting with its capital on the future growth and stability of the Bitcoin network and ecosystem. Pioneering Spirit: While not the first, a health tech company making such a move sets a precedent within its industry, potentially encouraging others to explore similar avenues. Enhanced Financial Resilience: A diversified treasury, including a strong allocation to a perceived inflation-resistant asset like Bitcoin , can enhance a company’s financial resilience against macroeconomic shifts. This strategic allocation reflects a nuanced understanding of global economic trends and the potential for digital assets to play a crucial role in future corporate balance sheets. Examining the Trend: Is Corporate Bitcoin Adoption the New Normal? H100’s latest fundraising round for Bitcoin acquisition is not an isolated incident but rather a prominent example of a broader trend. Over the past few years, a growing number of publicly traded and private companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. This shift represents a significant evolution in corporate finance, moving beyond traditional asset classes. However, this trend comes with its own set of considerations: Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings: Benefit Description Inflation Hedge Protection against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Store of Value A durable asset for long-term wealth preservation. Diversification Reduces portfolio risk by adding a non-correlated asset.

Key Takeaways: Charles Hoskinson says the audit of IOG’s ADA holdings is on track for a mid-August release. The audit follows serious allegations of $600M ADA misappropriation, which Hoskinson denies. Hoskinson plans legal action against accusers. In a recent post on X , Hoskinson said the report is “shaping up quickly” after he requested more context and transparency in several key sections. “I believe we are on schedule for a mid-August release, assuming the work continues at this pace and there are no delays,” Hoskinson said Saturday. Hoskinson Faces Scrutiny Amid $600M ADA Misappropriation Allegations The audit follows a wave of accusations leveled earlier this year, including claims that Hoskinson misappropriated $600 million in ADA through manipulation of the Cardano ledger. One allegation, made by NFT artist Masato Alexander, accused Hoskinson of using a “genesis key” to seize control of $619 million during Cardano’s 2021 Allegra hard fork. Hoskinson has denied the allegations and said he was “deeply hurt” by the erosion of trust within the community. “IOG never gave itself 350 million unclaimed ADA. This is a lie,” he wrote in May. “The vast majority was claimed, and the remaining that was forfeited after seven years of waiting was donated to Intersect.” Hoskinson pledged to make the audit public via a dedicated website and said the livestreamed reading would provide full transparency. The site will also include “historical artifacts from the sale,” he added. Beyond the audit, Hoskinson is considering legal options against those who made the allegations. “Meeting with the defamation law firm next week to discuss options and strategy,” he said.

The token is up more than 51% over the past month but still down by 73% compared to its all-time high of $3.10 registered in early 2021. Cardano Aims for DeFi Expansion with Stablecoin Talks Earlier this month, Hoskinson confirmed talks with Circle and Tether to bring stablecoins USDC and USDT to the Cardano network. While the Cardano community sees this as a bullish development, Hoskinson cautioned that adding stablecoins alone won’t revolutionize the ecosystem. Hoskinson argued that the presence of major stablecoins won’t “magically supercharge” Cardano’s DeFi space. Instead, he emphasized the need for foundational infrastructure and user adoption to grow the ecosystem beyond hype. IOG talks to Circle every 1-2 months and to Tether numerous times. The $100M stablecoin SWF + Bitcoin DeFi + thriving DeFi can bring in USDC and USDT. Or the Cardano Foundation can pay $23M and mint a bunch of liquidity, which they won''t.

The protocol allows Bitcoin holders to access Cardano’s smart contracts and low fees, while maintaining BTC’s liquidity and trustless nature. Cardinal uses a non-custodial wrapping model built on MuSig2, HTLCs, and BitVMX to create wrapped BTC and Ordinals for lending, borrowing, and trading. These assets are pegged 1:1, transferable, and redeemable with fraud-proof mechanisms—avoiding rehypothecation and centralized custody risks. The protocol aims to bridge Bitcoin’s capital with Cardano’s programmability, and is compatible with other Layer 1 chains.

2025-07-21 07:40:30+00:00,Japan’s yen rose after Ishiba’s party lost the election,"The Japanese yen jumped early Monday, catching traders off guard just hours after Shigeru Ishiba’s ruling party suffered a historic blow in the July 20 upper-house election. At 11 a.m. Tokyo time (10 p.m. ET Sunday), the yen strengthened 0.22% against the U.S. dollar, rising to 148.49, after sinking for two straight weeks on fears that Ishiba’s government would lose its parliamentary majority. Despite the defeat, the yen (still seen as a fallback when global tensions climb) found buyers fast. The currency’s two-week slide had tracked voter polls showing Ishiba’s administration in trouble. That forecast turned out right. But rather than spiral, the yen rebounded as investors processed the fallout. The safe-haven logic kicked in: with global markets unstable and Washington turning up trade pressure, Japan’s currency became the lesser evil. The sharp swing also came as markets across the Asia-Pacific opened the week on a volatile note. China leaves lending rates unchanged as yuan stays flat Over in China, the People’s Bank of China decided Monday to hold both its 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates steady, adding to the cautious tone across regional markets. The offshore yuan barely moved. By 9:50 a.m. local time (9:50 p.m. ET Sunday), it nudged up just 0.02%, landing at 7.1788 per dollar. The message from Beijing was clear: no rate cuts, no stimulus surprises, at least for now. Stocks in Hong Kong and mainland China started Monday on the front foot. The Hang Seng Index was up 0.55% and the CSI 300 rose 0.28% as of 9:42 a.m. local time (9:42 p.m. ET Tuesday). That bounce came right after the central bank’s move to keep its main borrowing rates unchanged. But the optimism was cautious, as most investors remained focused on external threats, especially trade. In Washington, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned Sunday that August 1 would be the “hard deadline” for countries to start paying tariffs. He added, “Nothing stops countries from talking to us after August 1,” suggesting negotiations can continue, just not without cost.

2025-07-21 08:06:25+00:00,NFT Market Cap Skyrockets to $6.4 Billion—Is the Bull Run Back?,"The post NFT Market Cap Skyrockets to $6.4 Billion—Is the Bull Run Back? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The NFT market has made a dramatic comeback, with its total market capitalization surging past $6.4 billion—a staggering 23% increase in just 24 hours. This marks one of the strongest daily performances in over a year and reflects renewed investor interest amid a broader crypto market rally. As daily NFT trading volume also soared past $39 million, the signals of a potential bullish cycle are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. From rising floor prices in blue-chip collections to renewed Bitcoin NFT activity, several factors have contributed to this explosive rise. Let’s examine the catalysts and what they mean for the future of NFTs. What Sparked the NFT Market Rally? The rally was triggered by a mix of macroeconomic momentum and market-specific developments. Most notably, Bitcoin price’s recent surge above $120,000 has brought positive sentiment back to digital assets. As a result, capital is once again flowing into NFTs, an asset class that had remained relatively subdued for much of the past year. The floor prices of key Ethereum-based collections witnessed notable growth. Moonbirds led the gains with a 31% jump, pushing its floor price to 1.84 ETH. CryptoPunks followed with a 14% rise to 46.7 ETH, while Azuki and BAYC also saw healthy single-digit gains. These collections, often considered blue chips of the NFT world, played a central role in pulling the market upward. Additionally, the NFT scene on Bitcoin has shown explosive growth. Ordinals and other Bitcoin-native NFT projects experienced over a 400% surge in weekly volumes. This cross-chain momentum has added a new layer of investor interest, proving that the NFT ecosystem is maturing beyond Ethereum. Market Data and Activity Highlights According to CoinGecko, the total NFT market cap climbed to $6.41 billion, with 24-hour trading volume jumping over 317%, reaching nearly $40 million. This isn’t just price appreciation—there’s a substantial rise in trading activity, suggesting stronger liquidity and growing market participation. Ethereum still dominates the NFT space, but Bitcoin-based NFTs and emerging ecosystems like Solana and Polygon are showing promising growth. This diversity in NFT infrastructure highlights a shift toward a more robust and scalable market environment, one less dependent on a single blockchain. Can the Momentum Continue? This surge may be the beginning of a sustained uptrend, but it comes with caveats. For momentum to hold, the NFT market must maintain high trading volume and buyer engagement. With BTC and ETH both in strong positions and traditional investors showing renewed interest in crypto assets, the broader market sentiment appears favorable. What’s different this time is the combination of increased cross-chain activity and expanding utility.

The post NFT Market Cap Skyrockets to $6.4 Billion—Is the Bull Run Back? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The NFT market has made a dramatic comeback, with its total market capitalization surging past $6.4 billion—a staggering 23% increase in just 24 hours. This marks one of the strongest daily performances in over a year and reflects renewed investor interest amid a broader crypto market rally. As daily NFT trading volume also soared past $39 million, the signals of a potential bullish cycle are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. From rising floor prices in blue-chip collections to renewed Bitcoin NFT activity, several factors have contributed to this explosive rise. Let’s examine the catalysts and what they mean for the future of NFTs. What Sparked the NFT Market Rally? The rally was triggered by a mix of macroeconomic momentum and market-specific developments. Most notably, Bitcoin price’s recent surge above $120,000 has brought positive sentiment back to digital assets. As a result, capital is once again flowing into NFTs, an asset class that had remained relatively subdued for much of the past year. The floor prices of key Ethereum-based collections witnessed notable growth. Moonbirds led the gains with a 31% jump, pushing its floor price to 1.84 ETH. CryptoPunks followed with a 14% rise to 46.7 ETH, while Azuki and BAYC also saw healthy single-digit gains. These collections, often considered blue chips of the NFT world, played a central role in pulling the market upward. Additionally, the NFT scene on Bitcoin has shown explosive growth. Ordinals and other Bitcoin-native NFT projects experienced over a 400% surge in weekly volumes. This cross-chain momentum has added a new layer of investor interest, proving that the NFT ecosystem is maturing beyond Ethereum. Market Data and Activity Highlights According to CoinGecko, the total NFT market cap climbed to $6.41 billion, with 24-hour trading volume jumping over 317%, reaching nearly $40 million. This isn’t just price appreciation—there’s a substantial rise in trading activity, suggesting stronger liquidity and growing market participation. Ethereum still dominates the NFT space, but Bitcoin-based NFTs and emerging ecosystems like Solana and Polygon are showing promising growth. This diversity in NFT infrastructure highlights a shift toward a more robust and scalable market environment, one less dependent on a single blockchain. Can the Momentum Continue? This surge may be the beginning of a sustained uptrend, but it comes with caveats. For momentum to hold, the NFT market must maintain high trading volume and buyer engagement. With BTC and ETH both in strong positions and traditional investors showing renewed interest in crypto assets, the broader market sentiment appears favorable. What’s different this time is the combination of increased cross-chain activity and expanding utility. Brands like Nike, Starbucks, and Pudgy Penguins are building real-world integrations and digital experiences that give NFTs practical value, not just speculative appeal. If the trend continues, market analysts expect the NFT market cap could push toward the $7 billion mark in the coming quarter. A sustained rally could also rejuvenate mid-tier collections and bring fresh liquidity to lesser-known projects. Wrapping it Up! The NFT market has re-entered the spotlight with force. A 23% daily gain and a $6.4 billion valuation suggest renewed strength, backed by strong fundamentals and rising floor prices.

Many third‑party trackers like Arkham Intelligence had previously assumed a much larger total based on on‑chain observations. This discrepancy stems from a key difference: the Marshals manage forfeited BTC—assets legally awarded to the government—while other agencies like the FBI and IRS may hold seized BTC that haven’t been forfeited yet, meaning they’re not officially government property The revelation stirred controversy. Senator Cynthia Lummis warned that liquidating more than 80% of government crypto reserves could be a ""strategic blunder"" in the global Bitcoin race.

DOGE has once again captured market attention, with its market cap zooming to $41.01 billion and daily volume rocketing past $6 billion. The rally comes amid a technical breakout, whale accumulation, and a significant capital injection by Bit Origin Ltd. However, not everything is bright, as the risk of $442 million worth of token unlocks and overleveraged positions may test the rally’s future. If DOGE is under your watchlist, this short-term Dogecoin price prediction is a must-read for you. Why is DOGE Price Going Up? The moonish DOGE price rally is being driven by the following bullish catalysts: Technical Breakout: The completion of a textbook cup and handle pattern has triggered a breakout above the crucial $0.25 resistance level. This has resulted in the liquidation of nearly $19.94 million in short positions, further fueling the rally. Altcoin Rotation: DOGE’s surge coincides with the breakout of the TOTAL2 chart, which tracks the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin, above an 8-year resistance.. Whale Accumulation: Wallets holding 100 million to 1 billion DOGE have added 1.08 billion DOGE in July alone. This includes a notable 48-hour spree that saw massive inflows. Institutional Backing: Bit Origin Ltd.’s $500 million fundraising round, aimed specifically at investing in Dogecoin, has added credibility to the meme token. Dogecoin Price Analysis As evident from the chart that I have shared, the breakout from the cup and handle formation suggests a measured target near $0.3299. Successively, Dogecoin could also have a further upside potential toward $0.4274 if momentum sustains. Talking about indicators, the Bollinger Bands are expanding rapidly, confirming rising volatility and buying pressure. RSI stands at 85.06, signaling extreme overbought conditions. However, caution is advised, as a $442 million token unlock scheduled this week may lead to short-term selling pressure. This could drag the price down to $0.20 if the support at $0.20 is broken. FAQs Why is Doge’s price up today? A cup-and-handle breakout, whale accumulation, and Bit Origin’s $500M fund have triggered the surge Should I buy Dogecoin now?

With Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech, housing data, and major S&P 500 earnings on deck, investors are on edge. The outcomes may dictate short-term trends in both traditional finance and digital assets. Fed Chair Powell’s Speech on July 22, 2025 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to speak on Tuesday, July 22, 2025, at a banking conference. His remarks are expected to shed light on the Fed’s stance on interest rate policy, especially following recent inflation increases. The Fed has held rates steady at 4.25%–4.50% since March. June inflation rose from 2.4% to 2.7%, marking the highest level since February. President Donald Trump has continued pushing for steep rate cuts , while Powell maintains a data-driven approach focused on inflation and labor trends. His comments could significantly influence crypto market sentiment. US Housing Market: Existing and New Home Sales On July 23, existing home sales data for June will be released. The figure had increased to 4.3 million in May but is now expected to decline back to 4 million, suggesting a cooling resale market. Meanwhile, on July 24, new home sales data will be published. The previous reading had dropped to 0.623 million in May, but expectations for June point to a recovery at 0.65 million. A rebound could reflect builder confidence and continued construction momentum, both of which signal the overall health of the economy. Also on July 24, the S&P Global US Manufacturing PMI will be released. The index rose to 52.9 in June from 52, signaling expansion in the sector. However, concerns are growing over inventory build-ups and tariff-related pressures that could lead to slower growth in July. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : White House Set to Launch First Major Crypto Policy Report On July 22 , S&P 500 Earnings to Drive Market Volatility This week, around 112 S&P 500 companies—roughly 22% of the index—will release their Q2 2025 results. These include major names like Google, Tesla, IBM, Coca-Cola, General Motors, Verizon, and Intel. Investors will examine these earnings for signs of corporate strength, consumer behavior, and inflationary pressures. Strong results may drive rallies in both traditional and crypto markets, while weaker-than-expected outcomes could lead to pullbacks. With Powell’s speech, housing data, PMI figures, and key earnings all scheduled this week, markets are bracing for potential volatility. Positive surprises could lift Bitcoin and altcoins higher, while disappointing data may cause short-term declines.

Yet the ongoing institutional support and Kiyosaki’s buy‑the‑dip stance hint that any slide could set the stage for a fresh rally. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"
2025-07-21 08:35:18+00:00,Bitcoin Strategy: Jetking Infotrain’s Bold Move for Future Growth,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Strategy: Jetking Infotrain’s Bold Move for Future Growth In a significant development that underscores the growing embrace of digital assets within traditional corporate finance, Indian IT firm Jetking Infotrain has made headlines with its decisive move to bolster its Bitcoin strategy . The company recently approved a substantial preferential equity issue, amounting to 115 million rupees (approximately $1.33 million), specifically earmarked to strengthen its financial approach centered around Bitcoin (BTC). This strategic allocation highlights a forward-thinking perspective from a long-standing IT player, signaling a potential shift in corporate treasury management across various sectors. Understanding Jetking’s Visionary Bitcoin Strategy Jetking Infotrain, a well-established name in the Indian IT and vocational training landscape, announced its commitment to a Bitcoin strategy through an official statement from its CFO, Siddarth Bharwani, on X. This move isn’t a sudden whim but a calculated financial pivot, adopted by the company in December 2024. The primary motivations behind this innovative approach are clear: to diversify the company’s asset holdings and to establish a robust hedge against inflationary pressures. The decision to raise equity specifically for this purpose demonstrates a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate financial asset. Instead of relying solely on traditional fiat currencies or conventional investments, Jetking is channeling fresh capital directly into supporting its digital asset ambitions. This signals a deeper integration of Bitcoin into its core financial operations, moving beyond mere speculative interest to a foundational treasury strategy. Why Are Companies Embracing a Bitcoin Strategy? Jetking Infotrain is not alone in its exploration of a Bitcoin strategy . Over the past few years, a growing number of public and private companies globally have begun to incorporate Bitcoin into their balance sheets. But what drives this trend? Several compelling factors make Bitcoin an attractive, albeit unconventional, asset for corporate treasuries: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply (capped at 21 million coins) offers a stark contrast to fiat currencies, which can be printed indefinitely. This scarcity makes it a potential store of value, preserving purchasing power over time. Diversification: Traditional investment portfolios often consist of stocks, bonds, and real estate. Bitcoin, with its low correlation to traditional markets, offers a unique diversification tool. Adding BTC can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Digital Gold Narrative: Often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with the precious metal, serving as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty. Its decentralized nature and resistance to censorship further bolster this appeal. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential. Companies holding Bitcoin are positioning themselves to benefit from its continued adoption and potential price appreciation as the digital economy evolves. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s commitment to innovation and its readiness to adapt to the evolving digital financial landscape. This can enhance brand perception and attract forward-thinking investors and talent. The Benefits of a Corporate Bitcoin Strategy For a company like Jetking Infotrain, adopting a clear Bitcoin strategy can unlock several strategic advantages beyond just financial gains: Benefit Category Description Financial Resilience By holding a portion of assets in Bitcoin, companies aim to protect against fiat currency devaluation and provide a hedge against economic instability, bolstering their long-term financial health. Growth Opportunities Exposure to a high-growth asset class offers the potential for significant capital appreciation, which can contribute substantially to a company’s balance sheet and shareholder value over time. Market Leadership Being an early or prominent adopter of digital assets positions a company as an innovator, attracting new investors, customers, and talent who are aligned with the future of finance and technology. Strategic Diversification Reducing reliance on traditional assets helps spread risk and improve portfolio stability, especially during periods when conventional markets are under pressure. Navigating the Challenges of a Bitcoin Strategy While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, a corporate Bitcoin strategy is not without its complexities and risks.

2025-07-21 08:40:19+00:00,Digital Asset Inflows: Unprecedented $4.39 Billion Surge Ignites Market Optimism,"BitcoinWorld Digital Asset Inflows: Unprecedented $4.39 Billion Surge Ignites Market Optimism The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as the latest report from CoinShares reveals an astonishing surge in digital asset inflows . This isn’t just a slight uptick; we’re talking about a monumental, record-breaking influx of capital that signals a growing confidence among investors, both retail and institutional. For anyone tracking the pulse of digital finance, this news confirms a powerful shift, painting a vibrant picture of an ecosystem attracting significant investment and solidifying its place in the global financial landscape. What’s Driving This Monumental Surge in Digital Asset Inflows? According to CoinShares’ latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report, the past week alone witnessed a staggering $4.39 billion in weekly digital asset inflows . This pushes the year-to-date inflows to an impressive $27 billion and has propelled the total assets under management (AUM) to an all-time high of $220 billion. These figures aren’t just numbers; they represent a significant validation of the digital asset space as a legitimate and increasingly attractive investment avenue. Let’s break down where this capital is flowing: Ethereum (ETH) : Led the charge with a record $2.12 billion in inflows, nearly doubling its previous record. This remarkable performance suggests a renewed investor interest in Ethereum’s ecosystem, possibly fueled by anticipation around potential spot Ethereum Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and its ongoing advancements. Bitcoin (BTC) : Not far behind, Bitcoin secured $2.2 billion in inflows. While slightly less than Ethereum this particular week, Bitcoin’s consistent strong performance highlights its enduring status as the premier digital store of value and the continued impact of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Other Notable Contributors : XRP: $36 million Solana (SOL): $39 million Sui: $9.3 million The sheer volume of these digital asset inflows , especially into Ethereum, is a testament to the market’s evolving dynamics. Ethereum’s 2025 inflows have already surpassed its total for 2024, reaching $6.2 billion, indicating a long-term bullish outlook for the smart contract platform. The Bitcoin and Ethereum Phenomenon: Leading the Digital Asset Inflows Charge While the overall market celebrates, Bitcoin and Ethereum stand out as the primary beneficiaries of these massive digital asset inflows . Bitcoin, often seen as the gateway for institutional capital, continues to attract significant investment, largely thanks to the success and accessibility offered by spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions. These regulated investment vehicles have demystified crypto investing for many traditional financial players, leading to a steady stream of new capital. Ethereum’s recent surge in digital asset inflows , however, is particularly noteworthy. Its record-breaking weekly performance underscores growing confidence in its fundamental utility and future potential. The network’s robust ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast developer community, makes it an attractive proposition for investors looking beyond just a store of value. The ongoing discussions and potential approval of spot Ethereum ETFs are undoubtedly playing a crucial role in drawing this unprecedented level of interest and capital into ETH-based products. The combined strength of Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance in attracting these substantial digital asset inflows solidifies their position as the twin pillars of the cryptocurrency market. Their ability to draw such significant capital often acts as a barometer for broader market sentiment and institutional appetite for digital assets. Beyond the Giants: How Are Altcoins Contributing to Digital Asset Inflows? While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the headlines, the latest CoinShares report also highlights healthy contributions from other digital assets, indicating a diversification trend within the digital asset inflows landscape. The inclusion of XRP, Solana, and Sui in the top performers list suggests that investors are increasingly exploring opportunities beyond the top two cryptocurrencies. XRP’s $36 million in inflows could be attributed to ongoing legal clarity and its utility in cross-border payments. The asset continues to maintain a dedicated investor base that believes in its long-term potential for institutional adoption. Solana (SOL) , with $39 million in inflows, showcases the continued interest in high-performance blockchain networks. Solana’s rapid transaction speeds, low fees, and growing decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem make it an appealing choice for investors seeking exposure to next-generation blockchain technology.

In the ever-unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, a prominent voice has just issued a stark warning that could reshape your investment strategy. Get ready to dive deep into CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction , a forecast that suggests a significant downturn is on the horizon, yet paradoxically, it also points to an unparalleled opportunity for those with patience and foresight. Who is CryptoCapo and What Drives His Crypto Prediction? For those immersed in the digital asset space, the name CryptoCapo resonates with significant influence. With a substantial following of nearly a million (specifically, about 973,000 followers on X, formerly Twitter), CryptoCapo has established himself as a prominent cryptocurrency analyst whose market insights often capture the attention of investors worldwide. His commentary, frequently shared on platforms like Telegram, provides a real-time pulse on his evolving market outlook. His reputation is built on a track record of identifying key market movements, though like all predictions in volatile markets, they come with inherent risks. What makes CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction particularly noteworthy is his consistent bearish stance, even amidst recent market rallies. While many might be tempted by a strong bounce, CryptoCapo urges caution, emphasizing that such movements can often be deceptive in a broader downtrend. He views current market strength as temporary, a mere prelude to a more significant correction. The Core of CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction: A Looming Dip and a Grand Comeback CryptoCapo’s latest analysis is a two-part narrative: a near-term challenge followed by a long-term reward. He remains steadfastly bearish despite recent market enthusiasm, predicting a “sharp decline” in the cryptocurrency market in the immediate future. This isn’t just a minor correction; he anticipates a substantial drop that could test the resolve of many investors. However, it’s the second part of his CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction that offers a glimmer of hope, or rather, a blazing beacon for strategic investors. Following this anticipated sharp decline, he foresees a “major recovery” unfolding around October or November 2025. This specific timeframe is crucial, as CryptoCapo labels it a period for “life-changing gains.” To put this into perspective, consider the following: Immediate Outlook: Bearish, with a predicted sharp decline. This suggests that current price levels might not be sustainable and a significant pullback is imminent. Mid-Term Strategy: Patience is key. CryptoCapo advises against succumbing to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during current bounces, as he believes better entry points are on the horizon. Long-Term Opportunity: A major recovery anticipated in October or November 2025. This period is highlighted as a prime window for accumulating assets that could yield substantial returns. This kind of foresight, while speculative, highlights the importance of having a long-term investment horizon in crypto. It’s not just about reacting to daily price swings but understanding the broader market cycles. Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster: Why Patience is Paramount in CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its extreme volatility, which often triggers emotional responses from investors. FOMO, or the Fear Of Missing Out, is a powerful psychological trap that leads many to buy assets at their peak, only to see their value plummet. Conversely, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) can cause investors to panic sell at the bottom, missing out on subsequent recoveries. CryptoCapo’s warning against FOMO is a direct call to resist these emotional impulses. He explicitly states that investors “should not fear missing out, as better opportunities lie ahead.” This advice is crucial because it encourages a disciplined approach to investing. Instead of chasing pumps, CryptoCapo’s perspective suggests that waiting for a significant dip could provide a more favorable entry point, aligning with the “buy the dip” philosophy that has historically rewarded patient investors in cyclical markets. Table: Short-Term Risk vs. Long-Term Potential based on CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction Factor Short-Term Outlook (Now – Early 2025) Long-Term Outlook (Late 2025 Onwards) Market Sentiment Potential for FUD and panic selling Optimism, recovery, and growth Price Action Predicted sharp decline, increased volatility Major recovery, potential for “life-changing gains” Investor Strategy Caution, patience, avoid FOMO, prepare for accumulation Strategic accumulation, holding for long-term growth Risk Level Higher immediate downside risk Reduced entry risk post-dip, higher upside potential This table illustrates the dichotomy of CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction , highlighting the need for a shift in mindset from short-term gains to long-term strategic positi",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cryptocapo-crypto-prediction-2025/,MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|RESEARCH|BTC,Crypto News|CryptoCapo|CRYPTOCURRENCY|investment strategy.|Market Analysis|PRICE PREDICTION,BTC,"CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction: Urgent Warning and a Massive Opportunity Awaits.

Long-Term Opportunity: A major recovery anticipated in October or November 2025. This period is highlighted as a prime window for accumulating assets that could yield substantial returns. This kind of foresight, while speculative, highlights the importance of having a long-term investment horizon in crypto. It’s not just about reacting to daily price swings but understanding the broader market cycles. Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster: Why Patience is Paramount in CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its extreme volatility, which often triggers emotional responses from investors. FOMO, or the Fear Of Missing Out, is a powerful psychological trap that leads many to buy assets at their peak, only to see their value plummet. Conversely, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) can cause investors to panic sell at the bottom, missing out on subsequent recoveries. CryptoCapo’s warning against FOMO is a direct call to resist these emotional impulses. He explicitly states that investors “should not fear missing out, as better opportunities lie ahead.” This advice is crucial because it encourages a disciplined approach to investing. Instead of chasing pumps, CryptoCapo’s perspective suggests that waiting for a significant dip could provide a more favorable entry point, aligning with the “buy the dip” philosophy that has historically rewarded patient investors in cyclical markets. Table: Short-Term Risk vs. Long-Term Potential based on CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction Factor Short-Term Outlook (Now – Early 2025) Long-Term Outlook (Late 2025 Onwards) Market Sentiment Potential for FUD and panic selling Optimism, recovery, and growth Price Action Predicted sharp decline, increased volatility Major recovery, potential for “life-changing gains” Investor Strategy Caution, patience, avoid FOMO, prepare for accumulation Strategic accumulation, holding for long-term growth Risk Level Higher immediate downside risk Reduced entry risk post-dip, higher upside potential This table illustrates the dichotomy of CryptoCapo’s Crypto Prediction , highlighting the need for a shift in mindset from short-term gains to long-term strategic positi"

Nowhere is this more evident than in the vibrant South Korean crypto community, often dubbed the “K-Community.” Known for its enthusiastic adoption and rapid trend shifts, understanding the pulse of this market can offer invaluable insights into broader crypto movements. This past week, from July 11 to 17, the K-Community on Bitcoin World provided a fascinating snapshot of the most compelling Korean crypto trends , revealing which tokens captured the most attention and discussion. Are you ready to dive deep into the digital assets that dominated the minds and conversations of Korean investors? What Were the Top Korean Crypto Trends in Search? When investors are curious, they search. The volume of searches often reflects potential interest, research, or a growing awareness of a particular asset. Bitcoin World’s data from the K-Community highlights the tokens that were most actively looked up during the specified week. The results present an intriguing mix of established giants and promising newcomers, painting a clear picture of the current Korean crypto trends in terms of user curiosity. Here’s a breakdown of the top 10 tokens that commanded the most searches: Token Search Count XRP 90,426 ETH 25,312 SOL 19,299 BTC 18,717 ONDO 14,511 SEI 13,589 PENGU 9,605 XLM 9,285 ADA 9,042 HBAR 6,631 XRP’s Phenomenal Lead: Leading the pack by a significant margin was XRP, with over 90,000 searches. This massive interest likely stems from its ongoing legal developments and its established role in cross-border payments. The K-Community has historically shown strong affinity for XRP, and any news, positive or negative, tends to amplify search volume. This clearly demonstrates a major element of Korean crypto trends . The Usual Suspects: Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Bitcoin (BTC) maintained strong positions, reflecting their foundational status in the crypto ecosystem. ETH and SOL continue to be central to decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, while Bitcoin remains the benchmark digital asset. Their consistent presence indicates a healthy, underlying interest in core blockchain technologies. Emerging Altcoins Catching Eyes: ONDO, SEI, and PENGU made notable appearances in the top searched list. ONDO Finance, focusing on tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), is gaining traction as investors look for new narratives. SEI, a Layer 1 blockchain optimized for trading, appeals to the fast-paced nature of the Korean market. PENGU, likely a meme coin or a newer project, suggests the K-Community’s appetite for novel, high-risk/high-reward assets. These newer tokens often represent the cutting edge of Korean crypto trends , indicating where speculative interest might be heading. Which Tokens Sparked the Most Discussion in Korean Crypto Trends? Beyond mere curiosity, “mentions” signify active discussion, community engagement, and often, a higher level of conviction or debate. This metric reveals which tokens were truly at the forefront of conversations within the K-Community on Bitcoin World during the same period. Understanding these discussion points is crucial for grasping the full scope of Korean crypto trends . Here are the top 10 tokens that were most frequently mentioned: Token Mention Count BTC 2,280 ETH 1,541 XRP 734 SOL 609 TRUMP 253 XLM 229 PENGU 212 ADA 186 SEI 150 DOGE 143 Bitcoin and Ethereum Dominate Discussions: Unlike the search list, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) took the top two spots for mentions. This is expected, as these are the pillars of the crypto market, constantly generating news, price movements, and fundamental discussions. They are the bedrock of any serious conversation about Korean crypto trends and the broader market. XRP’s Continued Presence: XRP remained strong in mentions, albeit at a lower rank than in searches. This suggests that while there’s immense curiosity, the active discussion might be more centered around its established status rather than new developments, or perhaps the intensity of debate has shifted. The Rise of Meme Coins and Political Tokens: The appearance of TRUMP and DOGE is particularly noteworthy. TRUMP, likely a political meme coin, indicates the K-Community’s engagement with global narratives, even those outside traditional crypto use cases. DOGE, a long-standing meme coin, continues to hold a place in discussions, often driven by celebrity endorsements or viral social media moments. These demonstrate the more speculative and culturally influenced aspects of Korean crypto trends .

For many, the whispers of an impending altcoin season are growing louder, especially among a significant portion of Korean crypto investors. This isn’t just wishful thinking; recent survey data sheds light on a powerful wave of optimism sweeping through one of the world’s most dynamic crypto markets, suggesting that the stage might be set for significant moves beyond Bitcoin. What’s Driving the Bitcoin Buzz Among Korean Investors? The latest survey, conducted by Bitcoin World and Cratos between June 15 and 18, provides a fascinating snapshot of weekly trends among South Korean cryptocurrency investors. With Bitcoin (BTC) recently hitting new all-time highs, it’s no surprise that confidence is building. The survey reveals a steady increase in bullish sentiment towards BTC’s immediate future, signaling a strong foundation for the broader market, which often precedes an altcoin season . BTC Price Expectation This Week (June 15-18) Last Week Increase or Significantly Jump 46.0% 45.0% Stable Market 29.7% 28.9% Decline or Sharp Drop 24.3% 26.1% Unpacking the Overall Market Sentiment: Is Optimism Pervasive for Altcoin Season? Beyond just Bitcoin’s trajectory, the survey delved into the broader market sentiment among South Korean investors. The findings paint a picture of cautious optimism, a common characteristic before a potential altcoin season truly takes hold. This general upbeat mood suggests that investors are not just focused on Bitcoin but are also looking at the potential for gains across the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem. Optimistic or Extremely Optimistic: 56.4% Neutral: 24.9% Fear or Extreme Fear: 18.7% The majority expressing optimism, coupled with a relatively low percentage feeling fear, indicates a healthy market psychology that could support a robust altcoin season . The Anticipation: Will We See an Altcoin Season This Year? The most compelling revelation from the survey points directly to the fervent expectation of an altcoin season . A remarkable 64.3% of respondents believe that an altcoin season will indeed arrive this year. This strong conviction contrasts with the 35.7% who do not foresee it happening in 2025 (or this year, aligning with the general sentiment). The survey’s focus on ‘this year’ for altcoin season expectation is crucial, suggesting a belief in near-term gains for alternative cryptocurrencies. What exactly is an altcoin season ? It’s a period when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin, often leading to substantial gains across the broader crypto market. This typically occurs after Bitcoin has made strong moves, stabilizing at a new price level, allowing capital to flow into smaller, more volatile assets. The current market conditions, with BTC’s strong performance, align well with historical precedents for an impending altcoin season . What Drives the Korean Confidence in an Altcoin Season? Korean investors are known for their active participation and keen eye on market trends. Their strong expectation for an altcoin season isn’t without reason. Several factors might be contributing to this bullish outlook: Bitcoin’s Stability and Dominance: After BTC’s strong rally and establishment of new all-time highs, many believe that capital will naturally rotate into altcoins. This ‘trickle-down’ effect is a classic pattern observed in previous bull cycles, where Bitcoin leads the charge, and then altcoins follow. Innovation and Development: Many altcoins represent groundbreaking technologies in areas like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Layer 2 solutions, and GameFi. As these ecosystems mature and gain adoption, their underlying tokens become more attractive. The continuous innovation in the altcoin space fuels optimism for their future performance. Increased Retail Participation: A general uptick in market optimism, fueled by Bitcoin’s performance, often brings new retail investors into the market, many of whom are drawn to the higher potential (and risk) of altcoins. This influx of new capital can significantly boost altcoin prices during an altcoin season . Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, inflation concerns, and interest rate policies can also indirectly influence investor appetite for riskier assets like altcoins, as investors seek alternative stores of value or growth opportunities. Navigating the Potential Altcoin Season: Actionable Insights for Investors If an altcoin season is indeed on the horizon, how can investors best prepare and participate responsibly?

BUBBLES are about to start BUSTING. When bubbles bust odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too. Good news. If prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin crash…. I will be buying. Take care. — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) July 21, 2025 The renowned investor and author of Rich Dad Poor Dad believes that Bitcoin’s crash would be a major signal to buy for the long-term. Kiyosaki disclosed that he has plans to buy Bitcoin and other precious metals, gold and silver, during their dip. BTC price has witnessed a slight pullback from its last week’s all-time high of $123,000 and is currently trading at $119,370 at the time of writing. He celebrated Bitcoin’s all-time high on July 14, calling it a great news for those who already hold Bitcoin. Kiyosaki’s Consistent Bearish Predictions Robert Kiyosaki has had a history of predicting stock and crypto market crashes. Last month, he warned of a historic market crash , predicting that billions of investors would flee traditional markets and rush to Bitcoin. In March, he cautioned investors that “the everything bubble is bursting,” forecasting a downward trend that would be the biggest in history. He said that the bust would be bigger than the 1929 market crash, which led to the Great Depression. Despite his warning, Bitcoin only experienced a small price dip, hovering around the $80,000 mark at the time. Ever since, the largest crypto has soared above $100,000, breaking $123,000 on July 14. As reported earlier , the author believes that Bitcoin would climb to $1 million by 2035. He called Bitcoin the “easiest way to get rich,” urging that even small-scale ownership, like 0.01 BTC, could change lives. Bitcoin Miners, Whales Increase Exchange Deposits – What’s Going On? On July 15, Bitcoin exchange inflows surged to 81,000 BTC, after the crypto reached an all-time high. This marks the largest daily figure since February. The increase was driven by whales and miners, where miner outflows hit 16,000 BTC. According to CryptoQuant, there was a drop in miner wallet balances, from 68,000 BTC to 65,000 BTC, since June 26.

2025-07-21 09:05:04+00:00,XRP Rockets 277% vs BTC in a Year as Ripple CEO Applauds GENIUS Act Win,"XRP Emerges as the Victor In the 12 months through, XRP has surged approximately 277 % against Bitcoin, a striking leap compared to BTC’s solid yet sober 88 % gain. Calling out this development, market analyst Kyle Chasse pointed out , “ Ripple is about to change everything. XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by triple digits … without a US ETF, treasury adoption, or native DeFi yield.” Interestingly, while BTC rode a wave of institutional adoption backed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasury allocations, XRP delivered triple‑digit gains without a U.S. spot ETF, DeFi protocols, or major treasury accumulation. Furthermore, the XRP/BTC ratio climbed from roughly 0.00000902 to about 0.0000303, signaling XRP’s dominance in relative performance. In other words, every XRP held meant significantly more Bitcoin-year growth, a dramatic shift in value perception. So, why has XRP elbowed Bitcoin in the past year despite the latter holding significant advantages? Well, intensified whale activity and macro-regulatory tailwinds have favored the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. For instance, whales holding over 1 million XRP bought roughly 100 million coins in days while those with over 100 million amassed about 1.45 billion XRP. Combined with institutional inflows, such as Teucrium’s XXRP ETF gathering over $248 million and $235 million daily futures volumes, this indicates a deep, committed investment base. Furthermore, the U.S. political climate has bolstered XRP’s narrative. A new Trump-era strategy includes a proposed federal “digital asset stockpile” with XRP explicitly named alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Therefore, XRP’s 277 % outperformance of BTC reflects a convergence of forces, such as technical breakouts, rising institutional demand, regulatory momentum, and ecosystem growth. With spot‑ETF approvals imminent, on‑chain strength peaking, and macroeconomic backdrop improving, XRP may be entering a sustained altcoin bull phase, distinguishing it from Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. Ripple CEO Hails GENIUS Act Win Ripple CEO Garlinghouse took to X, formerly Twitter, to share photos from a historic moment where President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, calling it a landmark win for crypto and the XRP community. Garlinghouse shared White House photos as the Ripple team witnessed President Trump sign the newly approved GENIUS Act. Calling it a historic moment for crypto, the Ripple CEO praised the law for delivering clear, pro-innovation regulation for the $250B stablecoin market, signaling a major shift from the nation’s traditionally cautious crypto approach. What the Passage of the GENIUS Act Means for XRP While the primary focus of the GENIUS Act is on stablecoins, industry experts see ripple effectsfor various cryptocurrencies, such as XRP. For instance, the immediate market response for XRP was strong following its passage. XRP soared to the $3.50 level with this rally reflecting renewed confidence in crypto regulation since the GENIUS Act provides the much‐needed clarity and signals a pro‐crypto U.S. stance. XRP’s parabolic structure continues to play out with the psychological price of $4.50 being in the picture. Additionally, the law paves the regulatory path for stablecoins like Ripple’s RLUSD. This new law mandates full reserve backing, audited reserves, and issuer licensing fully aligning with RLUSD’s design. Ripple has already applied for a national trust charter, pursued a Federal Reserve master account, and partnered with BNY Mellon for reserve custody. Analysts note that RLUSD can gain a first-mover advantage in a regulated stablecoin market. XRP, in this framework, benefits as the frictionless liquidity and settlement tool for RLUSD transactions. Conclusion The GENIUS Act doesn’t directly regulate XRP, but it clears the way for Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. By aligning regulatory infrastructure, reinforcing XRP''s bridge utility, and reducing SEC influence, the bill strengthens XRP’s role in regulated finance, explaining why Garlinghouse applauds the GENIUS Act passage. Meanwhile, XRP’s 277% gain vs BTC over the past year signals a radical shift because what began as speculative momentum is evolving into recognition of institutional adoption, on-chain utility, and regulatory legitimacy. With ETF entry points, whale accumulation, and bullish technical patterns converging, XRP is increasingly being perceived not just as an altcoin, but as a credible contender in the digital-asset space.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10061/xrp-rockets-277-vs-btc-in-a-year-as-ripple-ceo-applauds-genius-act-win,XRP|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|MARKET,News|Ripple,BTC,"XRP Rockets 277% vs BTC in a Year as Ripple CEO Applauds GENIUS Act Win. XRP Emerges as the Victor In the 12 months through, XRP has surged approximately 277 % against Bitcoin, a striking leap compared to BTC’s solid yet sober 88 % gain. Calling out this development, market analyst Kyle Chasse pointed out , “ Ripple is about to change everything. XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by triple digits … without a US ETF, treasury adoption, or native DeFi yield.” Interestingly, while BTC rode a wave of institutional adoption backed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and corporate treasury allocations, XRP delivered triple‑digit gains without a U.S. spot ETF, DeFi protocols, or major treasury accumulation. Furthermore, the XRP/BTC ratio climbed from roughly 0.00000902 to about 0.0000303, signaling XRP’s dominance in relative performance. In other words, every XRP held meant significantly more Bitcoin-year growth, a dramatic shift in value perception. So, why has XRP elbowed Bitcoin in the past year despite the latter holding significant advantages? Well, intensified whale activity and macro-regulatory tailwinds have favored the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. For instance, whales holding over 1 million XRP bought roughly 100 million coins in days while those with over 100 million amassed about 1.45 billion XRP. Combined with institutional inflows, such as Teucrium’s XXRP ETF gathering over $248 million and $235 million daily futures volumes, this indicates a deep, committed investment base. Furthermore, the U.S. political climate has bolstered XRP’s narrative. A new Trump-era strategy includes a proposed federal “digital asset stockpile” with XRP explicitly named alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano. Therefore, XRP’s 277 % outperformance of BTC reflects a convergence of forces, such as technical breakouts, rising institutional demand, regulatory momentum, and ecosystem growth. With spot‑ETF approvals imminent, on‑chain strength peaking, and macroeconomic backdrop improving, XRP may be entering a sustained altcoin bull phase, distinguishing it from Bitcoin’s evolving narrative. Ripple CEO Hails GENIUS Act Win Ripple CEO Garlinghouse took to X, formerly Twitter, to share photos from a historic moment where President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, calling it a landmark win for crypto and the XRP community. Garlinghouse shared White House photos as the Ripple team witnessed President Trump sign the newly approved GENIUS Act. Calling it a historic moment for crypto, the Ripple CEO praised the law for delivering clear, pro-innovation regulation for the $250B stablecoin market, signaling a major shift from the nation’s traditionally cautious crypto approach.

2025-07-21 09:05:24+00:00,Grok Forecasts Dogecoin Surge as Meme Coins Like Token6900 Prepare for Rally,"Dogecoin just flipped the script. After months of chop, $DOGE has broken out of a 5-wave descending broadening wedge – a classic reversal setup straight out of Elliott Wave theory. The Stochastic RSI is flashing green for the first time in ages, and $DOGE has already ripped 33% in a week , with $6B+ in daily volume putting it back on radar for retail and degens alike. According to Grok, and plenty of human analysts, this breakout mirrors the Q3 2024 structure that led to a major leg up. If history rhymes, we could be at the start of another full-blown meme coin supercycle. Traders are already rotating into wilder, weirder meme plays like TOKEN6900 ($T6900) , a post-ironic Ethereum token that makes $DOGE look like a corporate bond. What Just Happened to Dogecoin? Dogecoin just completed a textbook 5-wave descending broadening wedge on the 2-week chart; a pattern that often signals the end of a downtrend and the start of a new bullish impulse. It’s déjà vu. The setup almost perfectly mirrors $DOGE’s Q3 2024 breakout that front-ran a massive price spike. Momentum is now catching up. The Stochastic RSI just flipped bullish, crossing out of oversold territory. That’s typically one of the earliest signs of a potential trend reversal. And this one’s flashing bright green. If momentum holds, Grok says analysts are eyeing a short-term target of $0.36–$0.42. A breakout beyond that could unlock the next leg, with mid-term targets stretching as far as $0.48, or even $1.00 in the most euphoric scenarios. The trading data backs it up. $DOGE clocked over $6 billion in 24-hour volume, with price jumping 34.41% on the week. That kind of liquidity only shows up when meme traders start crawling out of hibernation. And then there’s the Elon effect. Rumors around Dogecoin payment integration on X continue to swirl. Add that to the breakout setup, and it’s a recipe for retail FOMO. Meme Coin Sentiment Is Shifting Dogecoin moves the entire meme ecosystem. Last cycle, $PEPE, $BONK, and many more exploded in $DOGE’s wake, riding the same wave of liquidity and chaos. It’s not about fundamentals. It’s about vibe velocity, as traders chase the next chart that screams louder than the last. This time, the best meme coins are outpacing hollow hype. The crowd isn’t buying utility. They’re buying honesty wrapped in absurdity. And nobody’s pretending anymore. They want the next $DOGE, but with fewer illusions. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) Is the Dogecoin You Were Warned About $DOGE follows the charts. $T6900 follows nothing. It’s the only honest asset left: zero utility, zero roadmap, and 100% commitment to meme-fueled delusion. Built on Ethereum, TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is a no-utility meme coin that doesn’t even try to pretend. Think SPX6900, but with more irony, more absurdity, and one extra token in supply, making it objectively superior. It’s already raised over $902,000 in presale at a price of $0.00665, with 67% staking rewards dangling like bait for the spiritually bankrupt meme trader. TOKEN6900 lives at the intersection of memes, markets, and mental collapse. It doesn’t care about AI promises, roadmap delays, or your DeFi bag that hasn’t moved in months. This isn’t about use case. It’s about collective delusion as liquidity. Because at this point, not trying to make sense of markets is the only rational decision left. Not sure how to get in? Here’s a full guide on how to buy TOKEN6900 . A Meme Wave Is Building – But Which One Will You Ride?

2025-07-21 09:15:34+00:00,"Trader Unveils Two Bullish Scenarios for Ethereum Explosion to $6,000 – But There’s a Catch","A closely followed crypto analyst is revealing two bullish scenarios that would lead the top smart contract platform Ethereum ( ETH ) to a price tag of $6,000. In a new strategy session on the TechnicalRoundup podcast, pseudonymous crypto trader DonAlt says the best-case scenarios for ETH right now are trading sideways or ripping up to new highs before pulling back. “I would much rather have this basically go sideways here, or just like either rip like completely just go up and then pull back from much higher. Basically, you go towards $6,000 and then you pull back from $6,000 to $4,000. That’d be much more fun and much more constructive than pulling back now or just going sideways here in this range… If it’s bullish, I think it should do one or the other, basically either sideways here without retesting $2,900 or $2,800.” But DonAlt warns that from a technical standpoint, Ethereum has gone up so fast without a significant retracement, opening the door for a deep corrective move. If that happens, the trader says that ETH’s uptrend will likely be reversed. “Whenever I’m looking for these kinds of pullback levels, sometimes I go on the lower time frames. So, for example, the daily time frame. You open that up, and you look ‘Hey, okay, we kind of haven’t had a pullback at all. We had some sideways [movement]. We had a little bit of a false range breakdown. But since then, basically since $2,000, we haven’t had a pullback. We almost went straight to $4,000, right? So we basically almost doubled. So I think there is a world in which if something macro-wise goes wrong, we pull back to like $2,900, maybe $2,800. But I would prefer not to. But I would prefer not to. Generally, I think that would oftentimes be a sign of weakness and that this isn’t going to be sustained.” Ethereum is trading for $3,778 at time of writing, a 5.4% gain during the last day.

2025-07-21 09:17:25+00:00,Bitcoin Analyst: XRP Is Coiling Up,"In a recent post on X, prominent Bitcoin analyst MMCrypto delivered a concise but impactful message: “XRP COILING UP.” While brief, the statement has resonated with traders and analysts who see it as a signal that XRP may be approaching a pivotal move in the market . XRP Price Overview As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.55, slightly up on the day after hitting a local high of $3.66 earlier in the week. XRP has maintained a tight trading range between $3.41 and $3.56, suggesting a period of consolidation. This compression in price movement lends credibility to the “coiling” narrative. In market terms, it describes a situation where price volatility decreases as tension builds, much like a spring being compressed before it is released. XRP COILING UP. — MMCrypto (@MMCrypto) July 20, 2025 The Coiling Pattern: What It Means A coiling pattern typically forms when price action narrows into a symmetrical triangle or wedge. It signals indecision, but also sets the stage for a high-probability breakout once one side is breached. Technical analysts have observed that XRP is forming higher lows while repeatedly testing resistance around the $3.60 level. This kind of tightening pattern, especially after a strong rally, often precedes a major price breakout. Indicators Point to Accumulation On-chain data and trading indicators suggest that market participants are preparing for a larger move. XRP’s open interest in futures contracts remains elevated, while spot trading volume continues to exceed $8 billion daily, both signs of strong participation. Although daily active wallet numbers have declined slightly since XRP’s recent peak, whale accumulation remains steady, indicating long-term confidence. Meanwhile, the MACD remains bullish on the daily chart, and RSI levels, though approaching overbought territory, still reflect strong momentum. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Risks to Consider Despite the bullish setup, caution is advised . If XRP fails to hold its key support at $3.38, it could retrace toward the $3.00 level. Profit-taking by early holders and a cooling of retail interest, as reported by platforms like BeInCrypto, could weigh on the price if bullish momentum stalls. Nonetheless, as long as XRP stays above its key support and maintains its coiling structure, the odds favor an upward breakout, particularly if market conditions remain favorable. MMCrypto’s statement, “XRP COILING UP”, captures the current state of XRP with precision. Price is consolidating in a tight range, technical indicators are aligning, and market interest remains high. Whether XRP breaks out or down will depend on how it responds to the pressure building beneath the surface.

2025-07-21 09:18:20+00:00,These Meme Coins Explode as Bitcoin Price Eyes $120K Again: Market Watch,"Bitcoin’s price saw subdued volatility throughout the weekend, trading within a relatively narrow range around $118K. The past 24 hours, however, have brought up a hint of revival with BTC inching closer to $120,000. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization hovers above $4 trillion and some sectors are seeing notable gains. There’s also some interesting economic data coming up in the following days, which may stir the pot and cause greater volatility. Bitcoin Bulls Want to Reclaim $120K Bitcoin’s price has gone through a somewhat quiet weekend but the market started moving as soon as Sunday came closer to an end. During the late Sunday evening trading hours (in Europe), the price crashed to an intraday low of slightly above $116K, which appears to have been a liquidity grab as the buyers stepped in and reversed course immediately, as seen in the chart below. The price immediately recovered and pushed towards the previously broken $120K level, peaking at around $119,600. This enhanced volatility resulted in around $400 million worth of liquidations across the derivatives markets, $221M of which were short positions. The bulls are seemingly in control and it remains very interesting to see if the previous all-time high level is within reach. Meanwhile, as CryptoPotato reported , interesting economic data is coming up this week, which may cause an uptick in volatility across exchanges. Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve Chairman will speak on Tuesday Reports for existing home sales data (June) come on Wednesday About 15% of S&P 500 companies report earnings this week (TSLA included) Source: TradingView These Meme Coins Explode It’s critical to note that Bitcoin’s dominance – the metric that tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market – has shrinked from 63% to 58% in the past seven days, indicating that altcoins are outperforming. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is today’s best performer, noting an increase of 25% in the past 24 hours, followed by Donald Trump’s TRUMP meme coin that is up by about 11.4%. Most of the large-cap crytpocurrencies are trading in the gree, charting increases anywhere between 1.5% and 10%. It’s interesting to see if this form of capital rotation will accelerate and cause a more considerable “altcoin season,” or if BTC is preparing to retake its captain seat once again.

This enhanced volatility resulted in around $400 million worth of liquidations across the derivatives markets, $221M of which were short positions. The bulls are seemingly in control and it remains very interesting to see if the previous all-time high level is within reach. Meanwhile, as CryptoPotato reported , interesting economic data is coming up this week, which may cause an uptick in volatility across exchanges. Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve Chairman will speak on Tuesday Reports for existing home sales data (June) come on Wednesday About 15% of S&P 500 companies report earnings this week (TSLA included) Source: TradingView These Meme Coins Explode It’s critical to note that Bitcoin’s dominance – the metric that tracks its share relative to that of the rest of the market – has shrinked from 63% to 58% in the past seven days, indicating that altcoins are outperforming. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is today’s best performer, noting an increase of 25% in the past 24 hours, followed by Donald Trump’s TRUMP meme coin that is up by about 11.4%. Most of the large-cap crytpocurrencies are trading in the gree, charting increases anywhere between 1.5% and 10%. It’s interesting to see if this form of capital rotation will accelerate and cause a more considerable “altcoin season,” or if BTC is preparing to retake its captain seat once again.

2025-07-21 09:30:19+00:00,Altcoins: Unlocking the Next Explosive Altseason or Facing Stalled Growth?,"BitcoinWorld Altcoins: Unlocking the Next Explosive Altseason or Facing Stalled Growth? Are you an avid crypto enthusiast closely watching the market for the next big move? The world of altcoins is currently buzzing with anticipation, standing at a pivotal crossroads that could define the trajectory of your portfolio. Recent insights from crypto data analytics firm Swissblock have highlighted a crucial development: three-quarters of altcoins are now testing significant resistance levels, signaling a decisive moment that could either ignite a vibrant altseason or lead to a period of consolidation. This isn’t just another market fluctuation; it’s a critical juncture where smart decisions could yield substantial rewards. What’s Happening with Altcoins Right Now? The crypto market is a dynamic beast, constantly shifting between periods of Bitcoin dominance and moments where altcoins take center stage. According to Swissblock’s latest analysis, we’re currently witnessing a fascinating setup. A vast majority of altcoins are pushing against key resistance barriers. Think of these resistance levels as ceilings that prices struggle to break through. Successfully breaking these ceilings often leads to significant upward momentum, while failure can send prices back down. This isn’t just about individual price movements; it’s about the collective strength of the altcoin market. Swissblock’s observation suggests a synchronized effort by many smaller cryptocurrencies to overcome these hurdles. The question on everyone’s mind is: Will they succeed? This collective test is a strong indicator that the market is nearing a “key turning point,” a phrase that often sends shivers of excitement (or apprehension) through the crypto community. Why is this moment so crucial for altcoins ? Because it will determine whether the market sees a genuine “altseason” – a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin significantly – or if the momentum fizzles out, leaving investors longing for more substantial gains. The outcome of these resistance tests will largely dictate the immediate future of your altcoin investments. Understanding the Altcoin Cycle: When Do Altcoins Truly Shine? To truly appreciate the current situation, it’s essential to understand the typical cycles of the crypto market, especially concerning altcoins . Swissblock distinguishes between two types of altseasons: Weak Altseasons: These occur when Bitcoin (BTC) maintains strong dominance over the market. In such scenarios, any capital rotation into altcoins tends to be brief and limited. While some individual altcoins might see pumps, there isn’t a broad-based rally. Investors might feel like they missed out, as only a select few assets perform well, and the overall market sentiment remains focused on BTC. Strong Altseasons: These are the periods every altcoin investor dreams of. They typically begin when Bitcoin shows signs of slowing down, and its market dominance starts to decline. As BTC consolidates or corrects, capital begins to flow out of Bitcoin and into altcoins . This leads to broad-based breakouts across a wide range of altcoins , resulting in significant gains for a diverse portfolio. These are the times when “everything goes up,” and excitement in the market is palpable. The current scenario, with BTC showing signs of slowing and capital rotation beginning, strongly hints that we might be on the cusp of a strong altseason . However, the success of these resistance tests by altcoins will be the ultimate determinant. Bitcoin’s Role: How BTC Dominance Impacts Altcoins Bitcoin’s dominance is a critical metric for understanding the potential for an altseason . BTC dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization. When BTC dominance is high and rising, it means more capital is concentrated in Bitcoin, often at the expense of altcoins . Here’s a simplified breakdown of how BTC dominance typically influences altcoins : BTC Dominance Trend Impact on Altcoins Market Sentiment Rising Dominance Capital flows into BTC; altcoins often struggle or bleed value. Limited altcoin pumps. “Bitcoin season,” cautious on altcoins. Falling Dominance Capital flows from BTC into altcoins ; broad-based altcoin rallies. “Altseason,” high excitement and risk appetite. Consolidating/Sideways Dominance Mixed bag; some rotation, but no clear trend. Potential for individual altcoin pumps. Uncertainty, selective trading. Swissblock’s observation that “BTC showing signs of slowing and capital starting to rotate” is precisely the kind of environment that precedes a strong altseason . It suggests that Bitcoin might be taking a breather, allowing other cryptocurrencies to catch up and potentially surge ahead. This shift in capital flow is the engine that drives significant altcoin gains.

Because it will determine whether the market sees a genuine “altseason” – a period where altcoins outperform Bitcoin significantly – or if the momentum fizzles out, leaving investors longing for more substantial gains. The outcome of these resistance tests will largely dictate the immediate future of your altcoin investments. Understanding the Altcoin Cycle: When Do Altcoins Truly Shine? To truly appreciate the current situation, it’s essential to understand the typical cycles of the crypto market, especially concerning altcoins . Swissblock distinguishes between two types of altseasons: Weak Altseasons: These occur when Bitcoin (BTC) maintains strong dominance over the market. In such scenarios, any capital rotation into altcoins tends to be brief and limited. While some individual altcoins might see pumps, there isn’t a broad-based rally. Investors might feel like they missed out, as only a select few assets perform well, and the overall market sentiment remains focused on BTC. Strong Altseasons: These are the periods every altcoin investor dreams of. They typically begin when Bitcoin shows signs of slowing down, and its market dominance starts to decline. As BTC consolidates or corrects, capital begins to flow out of Bitcoin and into altcoins . This leads to broad-based breakouts across a wide range of altcoins , resulting in significant gains for a diverse portfolio. These are the times when “everything goes up,” and excitement in the market is palpable. The current scenario, with BTC showing signs of slowing and capital rotation beginning, strongly hints that we might be on the cusp of a strong altseason . However, the success of these resistance tests by altcoins will be the ultimate determinant. Bitcoin’s Role: How BTC Dominance Impacts Altcoins Bitcoin’s dominance is a critical metric for understanding the potential for an altseason . BTC dominance measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization. When BTC dominance is high and rising, it means more capital is concentrated in Bitcoin, often at the expense of altcoins . Here’s a simplified breakdown of how BTC dominance typically influences altcoins : BTC Dominance Trend Impact on Altcoins Market Sentiment Rising Dominance Capital flows into BTC; altcoins often struggle or bleed value. Limited altcoin pumps. “Bitcoin season,” cautious on altcoins. Falling Dominance Capital flows from BTC into altcoins ; broad-based altcoin rallies. “Altseason,” high excitement and risk appetite. Consolidating/Sideways Dominance Mixed bag; some rotation, but no clear trend. Potential for individual altcoin pumps. Uncertainty, selective trading. Swissblock’s observation that “BTC showing signs of slowing and capital starting to rotate” is precisely the kind of environment that precedes a strong altseason . It suggests that Bitcoin might be taking a breather, allowing other cryptocurrencies to catch up and potentially surge ahead. This shift in capital flow is the engine that drives significant altcoin gains. Navigating the Altcoin Market: Strategies for the Turning Point Given that altcoins are at a decisive moment, what should investors consider? Here are some action"

2025-07-21 09:33:54+00:00,GBTC: Quantum Computing Risk (Rating Downgrade),"Summary I am downgrading Grayscale Bitcoin Trust to a ''Sell'' due to accelerating quantum computing risks threatening Bitcoin''s core cryptography within 5–7 years. GBTC''s high 1.5% annual fee and significant tracking error further erode returns, making it unattractive compared to lower-fee alternatives like BlackRock''s IBIT. While some argue quantum threats are overblown, I believe the decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes a swift, coordinated upgrade to quantum-resistant security unlikely. Until Grayscale cuts fees and Bitcoin implements quantum-resistant upgrades, I see little justification for holding GBTC given the existential and performance risks. Co-Authored by Noah Cox and Brock Heilig Investment Thesis Although shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) are up about 25% year-to-date and nearly 64% over the past year, I am downgrading shares of the ETF to a sell. When I last wrote on the Bitcoin ETF in mid-November, I rated shares as a hold, but I''ve now seen enough evidence to justify downgrading shares to a sell. One of the biggest factors in this decision is the fact that there is a newly material tail risk: Quantum computing breakthroughs that could compromise Bitcoin''s core cryptography within a 5-7 year horizon. In essence, we have to bake this in today. What I am saying here is that this is something we have to bake into Bitcoin''s price and fundamentals today, based on really the hard-to-price threat of quantum attacks on ECDSA-protected keys. My biggest concern with this ETF right now is that if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer emerges, it could derive private keys from public keys (via Shor''s algorithm) and siphon coins, triggering a sudden loss of confidence in Bitcoin - and by extension, the ETF GBTC. The reason this ETF is especially at risk is that its fee structure is so high. The ETF has a 1.5% per annum drag on it (compared to Bitcoin spot price). This compounding (and now with the addition of quantum risks) makes the ETF a sell. Why I''m Doing Follow-Up Coverage In my last piece of coverage I wrote on the ETF back in November called, '' Don''t Play With This Bitcoin ETF ,'' I put the ETF at a hold rating because its growing NAV discount (due to fees) meant this ETF would not see the same price action as compared to Bitcoin. Recent quantum advances, like Google''s ''Willow'' chip delivering a big performance boost, have accelerated expert timelines for "" Q-Day "" (I will explain more on this in the next section) from 2040 and perhaps beyond to 2027-2030. This now becomes a much more immediate threat. It''s why I believe shares are now a sell and why I am doing follow-up coverage. Quantum Computing Risks Really the heart of my concerns are the now accelerating risks with quantum computing. This will directly impact the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. Google''s ''Willow'' chip is performing much better than initial expectations. Experts are now projecting that Q-Day, which is, according to Aliro Quantum : ""the day that a quantum computer will be able to crack our public encryption systems,"" is approaching significantly quicker than many had initially believed. Experts who once forecasted Q-Day to occur in 2040 or beyond now warn that it could come within the next 5-10 years. This window is squarely within many investors'' timeframes, which puts Grayscale Bitcoin Trust at much higher risk, in my opinion. With this, the cascading risk that I see is that ECDSA vulnerability leaves the majority of BTC exposed. Whenever Bitcoin funds are spent (transferred), addresses divulge a public key. The big concern here is that a future quantum computer - one that could come as soon as in the next 5-10 years - could exploit that public key to derive private keys (via Shor''s algorithm) and steal coins. What''s interesting about this is that more than 60% of Bitcoin''s supply (by value) sits in addresses that have already exposed their public keys through reuse or legacy scripts. Included in this 60% are dormant or ""cold"" wallets. Most notably, Satoshi Nakamoto''s ~1 million BTC are a part of this, and this means that they immediately become high-value targets for quantum-enabled adversaries. The standard response to this risk from the Bitcoin community has been in 2 parts. First, they argue this is far away (this is not true based on my research). Second, they deflect, and argue that post quantum attacks will impact the entire crypto (and traditional) financial system. The problem with their second viewpoint is that traditional financial systems are centralized. Crypto is decentralized. Decentralized works great for systems that want to avoid control by a government. They are terrible for mass adoption/upgrades. I remain worried about the messy transition to post-quantum crypto. In order for Bitcoin to neutralize this threat and keep itself safe and secure, the community must eventually hard-fork or upgrade to a quantum-resistant signature scheme.

2025-07-21 09:35:15+00:00,Unlocking Bitcoin’s Future: Top 4 Crucial Market Trends This Week,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking Bitcoin’s Future: Top 4 Crucial Market Trends This Week Are you ready to dive deep into the fascinating world of cryptocurrency? This week, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin (BTC), the digital asset that continues to captivate investors and enthusiasts alike. As the crypto market buzzes with anticipation, understanding the key factors shaping Bitcoin ‘s trajectory is more crucial than ever. From ambitious price targets to macroeconomic shifts and the potential for an ‘altseason,’ let’s explore the four pivotal trends that could define Bitcoin ‘s performance in the coming days. Will Bitcoin Soar Past $130,000? Analyzing Price Potential The question on every investor’s mind: can Bitcoin truly breach the formidable $130,000 mark this week? This isn’t just a speculative fantasy; it’s a target being discussed by analysts who observe market sentiment, on-chain metrics, and historical patterns. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the current bullish momentum, fueled by institutional adoption and growing mainstream interest, provides a compelling backdrop for such ambitious forecasts. Benefits of a Price Surge: A move towards $130,000 would signify immense investor confidence, potentially triggering a broader rally across the crypto ecosystem. It would validate Bitcoin ‘s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, attracting even more capital into the space. For early adopters and long-term holders, this represents significant wealth creation. Challenges to Overcome: Reaching such a high price point isn’t without its hurdles. Strong resistance levels, potential profit-taking by short-term traders, and unexpected negative news could all impede upward movement. Market volatility remains a constant companion in the crypto world, and sharp corrections can occur swiftly. Maintaining momentum requires sustained buying pressure and a positive macroeconomic outlook. Actionable Insight: Keep a close eye on key resistance levels. Technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and moving averages can provide clues about market strength. Consider setting stop-loss orders to manage risk if you are trading based on short-term price movements. How Will the Fed’s Speech Impact Bitcoin and Crypto Markets? Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s scheduled speech this week is not just a domestic affair; its implications ripple across global financial markets, including the highly sensitive cryptocurrency space. Central bank policies, particularly concerning interest rates and quantitative easing, have a profound effect on risk assets like Bitcoin . The Rate Cut Conundrum: The market is keenly watching for any signals regarding a potential interest rate cut in July. A rate cut typically makes borrowing cheaper, encouraging investment and potentially driving capital towards riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, as traditional investments yield less. Conversely, hawkish remarks or hints of delayed rate cuts could lead to a ‘risk-off’ sentiment, potentially causing a pullback in Bitcoin ‘s price. Correlation with Traditional Markets: Historically, Bitcoin has shown increasing correlation with traditional equity markets, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Therefore, the Fed’s stance on monetary policy can directly influence investor appetite for growth assets. A dovish tone from Powell could be a significant tailwind for Bitcoin , while a hawkish stance might act as a headwind. Actionable Insight: Monitor financial news outlets for live coverage and immediate analysis of Powell’s speech. Understand that initial market reactions can be volatile. Consider how the broader economic outlook, influenced by Fed policy, aligns with your long-term Bitcoin investment strategy. Is an Altcoin Season on the Horizon Amidst Declining Bitcoin Dominance? The concept of an ‘altcoin season’ is a thrilling prospect for many crypto investors. It refers to a period when altcoins (cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin ) significantly outperform BTC, often leading to substantial gains. A key indicator of an impending altseason is a decline in Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin ‘s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization. Understanding BTC Dominance: When Bitcoin dominance falls, it suggests that capital is flowing out of BTC and into altcoins, indicating a shift in investor focus. This often happens after Bitcoin has had a strong rally, and investors begin to seek higher returns in smaller, more volatile assets. Factors Fueling Altcoin Interest: Beyond declining Bitcoin dominance, the rise of specific narratives like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Layer-2 solutions can ignite altcoin rallies. Innovations within these sectors often attract new capital and speculation. Furthermore, a stable or gently rising Bitcoin price can provide a secure foundation for altcoins to flourish.

According to cryptocurrency analyst Gert van Lagen, a parabolic move similar to the final-stage rallies of 2011, 2013, and 2017 is likely to unfold in the coming months, he said in an X on July 21. He suggested this could be the last major upswing before a broader economic downturn sets in. “The window for crypto to blow off is shrinking — expect a vertical frenzy like the final phase of 2011, 2013, or 2017 — not 2021. Then comes the recession… and the first true correction in Bitcoin’s history,” Lagen said. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

He believes the current setup suggests a potential climax in 2025, consistent with the final leg of a major Elliott Wave cycle. This expected blow-off phase is forming under high-risk conditions, sparking concern about what may follow. Beyond crypto, Lagen highlighted ominous signals from traditional financial markets. He noted that stock indices have reached long-term resistance levels, dating back to the market peaks of 1929 and 2000, while technical patterns indicate signs of a Wyckoff Distribution, which often precedes major market reversals.

Despite these warning signs, Lagen suggested the Federal Reserve is unlikely to implement aggressive rate cuts until economic weakness becomes more evident. Historically, significant monetary easing has only occurred after weaker companies are flushed from the system and labor markets soften significantly. It’s worth noting that markets have been anticipating Bitcoin to maintain its momentum and potentially target the $140,000 mark, following multiple new highs in recent sessions.

Analysts predict a gradual price increase, with potential highs reaching $175 by 2030. Bitcoin SV price (BSV) has been on muted growth trajectory compared to other altcoins. Since the beginning of the year, signaling prolonged bearish sentiment, Bitcoin SV (BSV) has consistently traded below its 200-day EMA band. Despite attempts to gain traction, the asset has failed to show any long-term bullish reversal, raising doubts among investors and traders about its recovery potential. Even it’s a non-profit organization, BSV association, optimistic activities like successful collaboration and hackathon events are not manifesting on the BSV price chart Many ask: “Can BSV Price break bearish trend above 200-day EMA?, “Is BSV a hidden gem waiting for its breakout, or just another risky bet?”. In this Bitcoin SV price prediction 2025 article, we’ll explore the future for BSV Price from 2025 through 2030. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV Token BSV Price $ 31.31930364 0.67% Market cap $ 623,104,103.3794 Circulating Supply 19,895,209.3750 Trading Volume $ 62,566,086.9638 All-time high $491.64 on 16th April 2021 All-time low $23.30 on 10th June 2024 Coinpedia’s Bitcoin SV Price Forecast 2025 Based on the historical data, price analysis, and broader market sentiments, the BSV price is expected to surge by the end of 2025. With an average of $86, the BSV token price can hit a high of $117 and a low of $55. Year Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 55 86 117 Bitcoin SV Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Bitcoin SV (BSV) faced challenges as it marked April’s low on day one of entering the second half of the year. But, the broader rally in the first week onwards pushed BSV to break out from its falling wedge pattern, as a result, it has surged more than 35% and still shows its urge to rise more. A look at RSI supports the optimism, as the value of 65 shows that there is ample space available to push higher until the strength exhausts. Therefore, at the current level, odds are significantly higher that if BSV crypto bulls regain strength, there is potential for a rally; in the short term, it might retest the $35 mark or even $50. Conversely, if the downward trend continues, BSV’s price may drop to new lows like $20 round level. Month Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) BSV Coin Price Prediction July 2025 20 27.5 35 Bitcoin SV Price Prediction 2025 In the second half of 2024, Bitcoin SV (BSV) formed an ascending broadening wedge pattern. This led to a strong buying movement in Q4 2024, pushing prices from the wedge’s lower to upper border. Many experts believed this bullish momentum could continue, but the upper border coincided with a strong resistance zone. Consequently, BSV’s price trajectory fell in Q1 2025, and even Q2 saw a decline despite a bullish attempt. As witnessed in the first half of 2025, it totally erased over 70% of its gains. Also, the attempts to rise in Q2 2025 made BSV struggle, which ended up forming another declining wedge. Several optimistic factors emerged in Q2 2025, yet price action remained muted. The worsening conflict between Iran and Israel, along with U.S. intervention in June, created further pessimism. Even a ceasefire announced in late June failed to boost BSV’s price. However, as July began, the BSV price surged from the pattern’s lower border, which was aligned with April’s swing low support. This happened with renewed broader crypto market optimism and top cryptos like BTC, XRP, and others pushing to newer boundaries. Therefore, this continued optimism in the short term has resulted in a strong breakout from Q2’s correction-based falling wedge pattern and seeks a retest of the 200-day EMA band. Therefore, if BSV bulls regain strength and flip the 200-day EMA band, another extension to the rally could occur. Supporting this optimism, In July, a DA lead within the BSV blockchain engaged the community on X, seeking their thought s on an open-source BSV wallet. When asked about the preferred login method for mobile devices, the majority favored the option of “Phone OTP & Password.” While this post primarily served as a community feedback initiative, it subtly suggests that BSV may be preparing for something significant. The development of the BSV wallet could be an early indication of larger plans on the horizon for the BSV ecosystem. That said, technically if on chart, a decisive move pumps then it could provide the momentum needed to retest the $50 mark by the end of July. If this breakout is supported by increased adoption, BSV could even target $65 by the end of 2025. Conversely, if BSV continues to decline, then its price may drop toward $24.

2025-07-21 10:00:00+00:00,Is this the next BTC? Buyers expect 100x gains from $0.03 before 2026 begins,"While BTC revolutionised peer-to-peer currency and store-of-value narratives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking aim at an equally critical frontier: real-yield DeFi. But unlike speculative tokens lacking intrinsic use cases, MUTM is building on fundamentals, combining a decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin system with a dual-yield staking ecosystem. Together, these innovations are shaping what many investors believe will be crypto’s next exponential story. With projections placing MUTM at $3.00 by early 2026, the current $0.03 price tag reflects a 100x opportunity hiding in plain sight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a stablecoin design focused on responsible issuance and on-chain stability. The stablecoin can only be minted when users borrow against overcollateralized crypto assets like ETH, ensuring that every token in circulation is backed by collateral exceeding its value. This structure prevents arbitrary creation and limits systemic risk. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the corresponding stablecoins are automatically burned, keeping the supply tightly regulated. To help maintain a consistent $1 peg, borrowing interest rates are managed through governance—not market demand—and can be adjusted strategically. Arbitrage mechanisms further support the peg by incentivizing users to buy or sell when price deviations occur. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further apart is its mtToken staking model. Whenever users lend crypto through the protocol, they receive mtTokens that track and accrue interest. These mtTokens can then be locked into smart contracts that participate in a buyback-powered reward system. Revenue from interest payments and loan activities is used to repurchase MUTM from the open market. These purchased tokens are redistributed to those who stake mtTokens, turning passive lending into compounding gains. Final weeks to secure $0.03 before 20% jump in phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale is now drawing global attention, with numbers that validate strong early traction. Phase 5 has already raised $12.70 million, with over 13,750 holders securing their positions ahead of the next pricing milestone. Currently, MUTM tokens are selling at $0.03, but this is about to change as Phase 6 kicks in with a 20% hike to $0.035. With 85% of the current tranche already sold, only a short window remains to lock in tokens at this ultra-low level. Lenders will soon be able to earn handsomely in the platform’s peer-to-contract (P2C) model. For example, lending $18,000 worth of LINK at a 55% loan-to-value ratio would generate a 10% APY, equal to $1,800 annually, all while the asset remains safe in a lending vault. Meanwhile, the peer-to-peer (P2P) side is designed for borrowers seeking flexible terms. A user could pledge $3,500 in TRUMP memecoins to borrow $1,400 in BUSD, with custom repayment structures that let users retain price exposure to volatile tokens while accessing stable liquidity instantly. Security remains a central pillar of the project’s growth. A full audit by CertiK returned a 95.00 Token Scan score and a 77.50 Skynet score—two of the highest trust signals in today’s DeFi space. On top of that, a $50,000 bug bounty has been launched to encourage responsible disclosures and platform integrity. Meanwhile, a $100,000 giveaway is already drawing in a global community of early adopters who are building long-term positions. One Phase 2 investor who swapped a portion of their BTC and ETH for MUTM is now watching a 2x gain in real time. With a listing price of $0.06 and a projected target of $3.00 by early 2026, that same investor is on track for a 200x return. These are the kinds of stories that defined early Bitcoin (BTC) believers—back when BTC was $10 and most of the world hadn’t caught on. A Roadmap Designed for Global Dominance Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap spans four detailed phases. Phase 1, which is currently underway with most milestones already achieved, focuses on launching the presale, executing marketing campaigns, initiating community growth, completing a smart contract audit, implementing an AI-powered helpdesk, and listing on tracking platforms. Pending tasks include developing educational content and forming a legal and compliance team.

Buyers expect 100x gains from $0.03 before 2026 begins. While BTC revolutionised peer-to-peer currency and store-of-value narratives, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is taking aim at an equally critical frontier: real-yield DeFi. But unlike speculative tokens lacking intrinsic use cases, MUTM is building on fundamentals, combining a decentralized overcollateralized stablecoin system with a dual-yield staking ecosystem. Together, these innovations are shaping what many investors believe will be crypto’s next exponential story. With projections placing MUTM at $3.00 by early 2026, the current $0.03 price tag reflects a 100x opportunity hiding in plain sight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies a stablecoin design focused on responsible issuance and on-chain stability. The stablecoin can only be minted when users borrow against overcollateralized crypto assets like ETH, ensuring that every token in circulation is backed by collateral exceeding its value. This structure prevents arbitrary creation and limits systemic risk. When loans are repaid or liquidated, the corresponding stablecoins are automatically burned, keeping the supply tightly regulated. To help maintain a consistent $1 peg, borrowing interest rates are managed through governance—not market demand—and can be adjusted strategically. Arbitrage mechanisms further support the peg by incentivizing users to buy or sell when price deviations occur. What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further apart is its mtToken staking model. Whenever users lend crypto through the protocol, they receive mtTokens that track and accrue interest. These mtTokens can then be locked into smart contracts that participate in a buyback-powered reward system. Revenue from interest payments and loan activities is used to repurchase MUTM from the open market. These purchased tokens are redistributed to those who stake mtTokens, turning passive lending into compounding gains. Final weeks to secure $0.03 before 20% jump in phase 6 Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale is now drawing global attention, with numbers that validate strong early traction. Phase 5 has already raised $12.70 million, with over 13,750 holders securing their positions ahead of the next pricing milestone. Currently, MUTM tokens are selling at $0.03, but this is about to change as Phase 6 kicks in with a 20% hike to $0.035. With 85% of the current tranche already sold, only a short window remains to lock in tokens at this ultra-low level. Lenders will soon be able to earn handsomely in the platform’s peer-to-contract (P2C) model. For example, lending $18,000 worth of LINK at a 55% loan-to-value ratio would generate a 10% APY, equal to $1,800 annually, all while the asset remains safe in a lending vault. Meanwhile, the peer-to-peer (P2P) side is designed for borrowers seeking flexible terms. A user could pledge $3,500 in TRUMP memecoins to borrow $1,400 in BUSD, with custom repayment structures that let users retain price exposure to volatile tokens while accessing stable liquidity instantly. Security remains a central pillar of the project’s growth. A full audit by CertiK returned a 95.00 Token Scan score and a 77.50 Skynet score—two of the highest trust signals in today’s DeFi space. On top of that, a $50,000 bug bounty has been launched to encourage responsible disclosures and platform integrity. Meanwhile, a $100,000 giveaway is already drawing in a global community of early adopters who are building long-term positions. One Phase 2 investor who swapped a portion of their BTC and ETH for MUTM is now watching a 2x gain in real time. With a listing price of $0.06 and a projected target of $3.00 by early 2026, that same investor is on track for a 200x return. These are the kinds of stories that defined early Bitcoin (BTC) believers—back when BTC was $10 and most of the world hadn’t caught on. A Roadmap Designed for Global Dominance Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap spans four detailed phases. Phase 1, which is currently underway with most milestones already achieved, focuses on launching the presale, executing marketing campaigns, initiating community growth, completing a smart contract audit, implementing an AI-powered helpdesk, and listing on tracking platforms. Pending tasks include developing educational content and forming a legal and compliance team. Phase 2 will begin the development of core smart contracts, DApp front-end and back-end infrastructure, risk parameters, and advanced analytics tools, with ongoing internal and external audits. Phase 3 will introduce beta testing on testnet, establish a bug reporting system, finalise documentation, and prepare for exchange listings. Finally, Phase 4 will launch the live Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform, activate token claims, list MUTM on exchanges, expand into regional compliance, initiate institutional partnerships, and pursue cross-chain integration and platform enhancements.

On Monday, Kiyosaki said , “Bubbles are about to start busting,” and added that he expects these assets to drop significantly before he plans to buy more. His comments come just days after celebrating Bitcoin’s new all-time high above $120,000 , where he remarked that the rally was “bad news” for those who never invested, claiming, “They own nothing.” Despite his previous enthusiasm , Kiyosaki also cautioned investors to avoid overextending themselves in the crypto market, famously saying, “Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.” He had earlier stated he would buy one more Bitcoin before pausing further purchases to watch where the economy is heading. Mixed Signals from Kiyosaki Spark Debate Kiyosaki’s recent bearish stance contrasts with his earlier criticism of “clickbait losers” who warn of Bitcoin crashes, arguing that such predictions aim to scare speculators away from the market. This inconsistency has led to criticism from some corners of the crypto community. The market newsletter Brew Markets highlighted that Kiyosaki has issued multiple crash warnings for both crypto and stock markets, many of which did not materialize. Despite discussions about Bitcoin and crypto treasuries displaying bubble-like characteristics , experts remain divided. Joe Burnett, director of Bitcoin Strategy, dismissed the bubble argument, explaining that companies accumulating Bitcoin are not betting on untested ideas but are investing directly in what they consider sound money. According to Burnett, the perception of a bubble persists because many still do not understand Bitcoin’s underlying value. Investors Urged to Conduct Independent Research Henrik Andersson, chief investment officer at Apollo Capital, encouraged investors to rely on their own research rather than following “influencers” for investment decisions. Similarly, “Cape,” an NFT collector and founder of the Furyou collection, pointed out that Bitcoin has been labelled a scam and a bubble nearly every year since its inception, yet it continues to recover and grow. Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle pattern remains intact, with analysts expecting 2025 to mark the bull market peak if the pattern holds. Current projections place Bitcoin’s potential top between $130,000 and $200,000 by year-end, while CoinGlass’s bull market dashboard shows no signs of an imminent peak. Kiyosaki’s warning, while noteworthy, may serve as a reminder for investors to assess their risk appetite and long-term strategies before making decisions amid Bitcoin’s volatile but historically cyclical market movements.

2025-07-21 10:20:45+00:00,"Altcoins Rally- Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano Price Surge as Bitcoin Slows","The post Altcoins Rally- Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano Price Surge as Bitcoin Slows appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is showing fresh signs of life beyond Bitcoin. As BTC hovers just below $120,000, altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana are gaining strong momentum. This shift is happening as traders look for new opportunities and investors bet on projects with strong real-world connections. Altcoins Join the Party Ethereum jumped to $3,793 , its highest price since early 2022. The rise is being driven by strong interest from institutions, especially in new Ethereum-based treasury products and ETF flows. With this recent push, Ethereum has gained 25 percent in just one week. Traders are also seeing the ETH to BTC ratio rise, which means Ethereum is starting to perform better compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin is another standout this week . It shot up by more than 9 percent in the last 24 hours and is now up over 33 percent for the week. It’s trading at around 27 cents, the highest it’s been in over a year. Traders are showing more interest in riskier assets again, which is helping coins like Dogecoin. Meanwhile, apart from ETH and Doge, XRP is also making a move, priced around $3.55 with a 4% gain, while Solana jumped to $189. Cardano and BNB also posted gains of over 3 percent. Analysts say Bitcoin’s dominance is falling, down from 66% in June to just under 62 percent now, which suggests traders are rotating their money into altcoins. Is This Alt Season? Most alt seasons only last 1–2 months. Until #Bitcoin dominance breaks down and trends lower, don’t expect a true alt run. Alts pump when #BTC is breaking out but once it chops or corrects, dominance returns and gains vanish fast. Be careful and play it smart. pic.twitter.com/6YZturOEc1 — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) July 20, 2025 Meanwhile, Crypto analyst VirtualBacon cautions that true altcoin seasons are usually short-lived, lasting only 1–2 months. He explains that altcoins typically rally when Bitcoin is breaking out, but once Bitcoin slows down or corrects, its dominance rises again, causing altcoin gains to quickly disappear. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoins Heat Up as Bitcoin Cools, But Is the Rally Ending Soon? , Real-World Use Cases Catch Investor Attention However the trend of capital flow from BTC to Alts is not new. A big reason for this rotation is the growing interest in real-world asset tokenization. This includes turning things like treasury bonds, credit, and real estate into blockchain-based tokens. The total value of tokenized real-world assets has now crossed $24 billion. Big financial players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are already exploring this space. New Laws Could Help Altcoins Grow More There’s also hope that new U.S. laws could make it easier for altcoins to grow.

The post Altcoins Rally- Ethereum, XRP, and Cardano Price Surge as Bitcoin Slows appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is showing fresh signs of life beyond Bitcoin. As BTC hovers just below $120,000, altcoins like Ethereum, Dogecoin, XRP, and Solana are gaining strong momentum. This shift is happening as traders look for new opportunities and investors bet on projects with strong real-world connections. Altcoins Join the Party Ethereum jumped to $3,793 , its highest price since early 2022. The rise is being driven by strong interest from institutions, especially in new Ethereum-based treasury products and ETF flows. With this recent push, Ethereum has gained 25 percent in just one week. Traders are also seeing the ETH to BTC ratio rise, which means Ethereum is starting to perform better compared to Bitcoin. Dogecoin is another standout this week . It shot up by more than 9 percent in the last 24 hours and is now up over 33 percent for the week. It’s trading at around 27 cents, the highest it’s been in over a year. Traders are showing more interest in riskier assets again, which is helping coins like Dogecoin. Meanwhile, apart from ETH and Doge, XRP is also making a move, priced around $3.55 with a 4% gain, while Solana jumped to $189. Cardano and BNB also posted gains of over 3 percent. Analysts say Bitcoin’s dominance is falling, down from 66% in June to just under 62 percent now, which suggests traders are rotating their money into altcoins. Is This Alt Season? Most alt seasons only last 1–2 months. Until #Bitcoin dominance breaks down and trends lower, don’t expect a true alt run. Alts pump when #BTC is breaking out but once it chops or corrects, dominance returns and gains vanish fast. Be careful and play it smart. pic.twitter.com/6YZturOEc1 — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) July 20, 2025 Meanwhile, Crypto analyst VirtualBacon cautions that true altcoin seasons are usually short-lived, lasting only 1–2 months. He explains that altcoins typically rally when Bitcoin is breaking out, but once Bitcoin slows down or corrects, its dominance rises again, causing altcoin gains to quickly disappear. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Altcoins Heat Up as Bitcoin Cools, But Is the Rally Ending Soon? , Real-World Use Cases Catch Investor Attention However the trend of capital flow from BTC to Alts is not new. A big reason for this rotation is the growing interest in real-world asset tokenization. This includes turning things like treasury bonds, credit, and real estate into blockchain-based tokens. The total value of tokenized real-world assets has now crossed $24 billion. Big financial players like BlackRock and JPMorgan are already exploring this space. New Laws Could Help Altcoins Grow More There’s also hope that new U.S. laws could make it easier for altcoins to grow. The GENIUS Act , which focuses on stablecoins and digital asset taxes, is still being discussed in Congress. Even though it didn’t pass this week, its progress shows that clearer rules are coming.

As the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee and a well-known critic of digital assets, she’s pushing for stronger rules to protect the financial system from what she sees as growing risks in the crypto space. Her announcement comes as a direct response to Republican lawmakers, setting the stage for a serious political showdown over crypto regulation in Washington. Warren Pushes Back: No More Handouts for Crypto Warren’s plan challenges the approach laid out by Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), and Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.). Their framework, introduced in late June, promotes innovation and lighter regulation. Warren strongly disagrees . “I’m concerned that what my Republican colleagues are aiming for is another industry handout that gives the crypto lobby everything on its wish list,” she is expected to say during a Senate hearing on Wednesday. She warns that weakening financial regulations to favor crypto could undermine securities laws and create risks for the traditional financial system. According to Warren, crypto should not get special treatment, instead it should play by the same rules as the rest of the financial world. Warren’s Key Priorities: Stability, Oversight, and Accountability Warren’s framework centers on four key goals: Protecting the financial system from instability Enforcing anti-money laundering (AML) laws Ensuring investor safety Preventing public officials from using crypto for personal gain She will also address concerns over “ President’s crypto corruption “, highlighting President Donald Trump’s and his family’s ventures in stablecoins, meme coins, and bitcoin mining. “If we’re going to provide rules of the road for crypto, we need to shut down this superhighway for presidential corruption at the same time,” Warren will argue. Her approach is about tightening rules, not creating new ways for crypto insiders or politicians to benefit. Republicans Say Innovation Must Come First Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are focused on encouraging innovation. Their framework calls for updated regulations that are “targeted” and “pro-innovation,” and suggests that financial agencies should be open to the growth of crypto. Warren, however, believes this approach puts the industry ahead of investor protections and opens the door to future financial problems. September Is the New Deadline The Senate is preparing to introduce a broader crypto market structure bill. This comes after passing the GENIUS Act , which focuses on stablecoin regulation. That bill now heads to the House for review. The upcoming market structure bill will deal with how oversight of the crypto industry is divided between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Senators Scott and Lummis say they now aim to pass the full bill by the end of September, slightly later than their original August timeline.

2025-07-21 10:25:18+00:00,Merlin Chain Unleashes Bitcoin’s Ultimate Potential with 2.0 Upgrade,"BitcoinWorld Merlin Chain Unleashes Bitcoin’s Ultimate Potential with 2.0 Upgrade For years, Bitcoin (BTC) has stood as the undisputed king of cryptocurrency, a digital store of value revered for its security and decentralization. Yet, its inherent design, prioritizing robustness over flexibility, has often limited its direct utility beyond being a “digital gold.” Imagine a world where your BTC isn’t just sitting idle, but actively working for you, earning yields, participating in decentralized finance, and powering innovative applications—all without ever truly leaving the secure embrace of the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is the ambitious vision driving the latest evolution in the Bitcoin landscape: Merlin Chain 2.0. The announcement of Merlin Chain ‘s 2.0 upgrade has sent ripples of excitement through the crypto community. This isn’t just another layer-2 solution; it’s a bold declaration of intent to transform Bitcoin from a passive asset into a dynamic, productive force. By integrating cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and chain abstraction, Merlin Chain aims to unlock unprecedented liquidity and utility for the world’s premier cryptocurrency, making it more accessible and functional than ever before. What is Merlin Chain 2.0 and Why Does it Matter? At its core, Merlin Chain 2.0 represents a significant leap forward in making Bitcoin truly productive. The team behind Merlin Chain has articulated a clear mission: to empower users to “hold, earn, and invest without leaving the BTC ecosystem.” This vision directly addresses one of Bitcoin’s long-standing challenges – its limited programmability and high transaction fees on the mainnet, which often push users towards other blockchain networks for more active engagement. So, how does Merlin Chain plan to achieve this? It leverages a layer-2 architecture, meaning it operates on top of the Bitcoin mainnet, processing transactions off-chain to reduce congestion and costs, then periodically settling them back onto the main chain for security. The 2.0 iteration introduces several key enhancements: Enhanced Productivity for BTC Holders: No longer content with just HODLing, users can now actively deploy their Bitcoin in various decentralized applications (dApps) built on Merlin Chain , opening avenues for yield generation and investment opportunities. Seamless User Experience through Chain Abstraction: One of the biggest hurdles for new users in crypto is the complexity of managing multiple chains, bridges, and wallets. Chain abstraction, a core tenet of Merlin Chain 2.0, aims to simplify this by abstracting away the underlying blockchain complexities. Imagine interacting with a dApp and not needing to worry about which specific chain your assets are on – it just works. This dramatically lowers the barrier to entry and makes the entire ecosystem more intuitive. AI Integration for Smarter Operations: While specific details are still emerging, the mention of AI integration suggests intelligent automation, optimized resource allocation, and potentially enhanced security features within the Merlin Chain ecosystem. AI could play a role in optimizing transaction routing, identifying potential risks, or even personalizing user experiences. The significance of Merlin Chain 2.0 lies in its potential to not only enhance Bitcoin’s utility but also to foster a vibrant, self-contained ecosystem around it. By keeping users within the BTC fold, it strengthens Bitcoin’s overall network effect and prevents value from flowing out to other chains for productive activities. How Does Merlin Chain Enhance Bitcoin’s Utility? The journey to make Bitcoin more productive involves a multi-faceted approach, and Merlin Chain is tackling it head-on. Let’s delve deeper into the mechanisms that allow this layer-2 solution to unlock new possibilities for BTC. Bridging the Gap: BTC on Layer-2 Traditionally, using Bitcoin for anything beyond simple transfers has been challenging due to its design. Merlin Chain acts as a bridge, allowing Bitcoin to be securely locked on the mainnet while its equivalent is represented and utilized on the faster, more flexible layer-2. This process, often involving cryptographic proofs and secure bridging mechanisms, ensures that the underlying BTC remains secure and verifiable. Unlocking Liquidity: A Sea of Opportunities One of the most exciting prospects of Merlin Chain 2.0 is its ability to unlock the immense, often dormant, liquidity of Bitcoin. Trillions of dollars in BTC sit in wallets globally. By enabling this capital to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and other Web3 applications, Merlin Chain can inject significant capital into these emerging sectors. This isn’t just about moving money; it’s about activating it, allowing it to generate returns and contribute to the growth of a broader digital economy.

2025-07-21 10:30:27+00:00,"Cardano Under Fire: $600 Million IOG Audit Set For August, Says Hoskinson","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has received the first draft of the long‑promised audit into Input Output Global’s (IOG) ADA holdings and says the document is “shaping up quickly.” In a X post on 20 July he wrote , “I just received the first copy of the audit report. I requested a lot more detail and context in several areas, but it’s shaping up quickly… I believe we are on schedule for a mid‑August release, assuming the work continues at this pace and there are no delays.” Why The Cardano Audit Is Needed The audit is the centerpiece of Hoskinson’s effort to rebut accusations that IOG quietly commandeered roughly $600 million worth of ADA during the 2021 Allegra hard fork. The charge—first amplified in May by NFT artist Masato Alexander—claims Hoskinson used a “genesis key” to rewrite the ledger and move 318‑350 million unclaimed tokens into company‑controlled wallets.

I requested a lot more detail and context in several areas, but it’s shaping up quickly… I believe we are on schedule for a mid‑August release, assuming the work continues at this pace and there are no delays.” Why The Cardano Audit Is Needed The audit is the centerpiece of Hoskinson’s effort to rebut accusations that IOG quietly commandeered roughly $600 million worth of ADA during the 2021 Allegra hard fork.

2025-07-21 10:36:33+00:00,Crypto Funds Hit Record $4.39B Weekly Inflows – Biggest Rally Coming Soon?,"Digital asset investment products recorded an all-time high in weekly inflows of $4.39 billion, surpassing the previous record of $4.27 billion set after the U.S. election in December 2024 and pushing total assets under management to a historic $220 billion, according to CoinShares . The surge marks the 14th consecutive week of inflows, bringing year-to-date totals to $27 billion as institutional appetite intensifies across Bitcoin and Ethereum products. Institutions are Flocking Crypto Weekly trading turnover in exchange-traded products reached record levels globally at $39.2 billion, driven by elevated volumes in both major cryptocurrencies. Ethereum stole the spotlight with a record $2.12 billion in inflows, nearly doubling its previous record of $1.2 billion and bringing 2025 inflows to $6.2 billion, exceeding the entire 2024 total. Source: CoinShares The past 13 weeks of inflows now represent 23% of Ethereum’s total assets under management. Bitcoin attracted $2.2 billion in inflows, down from last week’s $2.7 billion, while ETP trading volumes comprised 55% of total Bitcoin exchange volume. Notably, the United States dominated regional flows with $4.36 billion in inflows, while Switzerland, Hong Kong, and Australia recorded modest positive flows. Source: CoinShares The massive capital influx coincides with Trump’s signing of the GENIUS Act and his sharing of the “greatest Bitcoin explanation of all time” video , creating perfect storm conditions for continued institutional adoption. In fact, over 273 companies now hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, doubling from 124 companies since June 5. Ethereum Breaks Multiple Records as Institutional Interest Surges Ethereum’s $2.12 billion weekly inflow smashed all previous records, with the 13-week cumulative total representing an unprecedented 23% of the cryptocurrency’s assets under management. This compares favorably to Bitcoin’s 9.8% inflow-to-AUM ratio over the same period. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded $2.18 billion in weekly net inflows from July 14 to 18, setting a new all-time high and marking eight consecutive days of positive flows. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge with substantial institutional adoption, while Fidelity and Grayscale products contributed to the broad-based demand. The surge positions Ethereum ETFs as serious competitors to Bitcoin products in terms of institutional appeal, especially as Bitcoin dominance is decreasing. Weekly trading volumes doubled year-to-date averages, with global ETP turnover hitting record levels as institutional and retail investors pile into regulated Ethereum exposure. Solana, XRP, and Sui also benefited from the altcoin momentum, recording inflows of $39 million, $36 million, and $9.3 million, respectively. Notably, BlackRock reported $14.1 billion in digital asset net inflows for Q2 2025 , pushing the firm’s crypto assets under management to $79.6 billion. Digital assets contributed $14 billion of BlackRock’s $85 billion total ETF inflows during the quarter, establishing crypto as one of the fastest-growing product categories. Corporate Treasury Adoption Accelerates Amid Regulatory Clarity According to Reuters , public companies worldwide have increased their Bitcoin holdings by 120% since July 2024, now controlling just over 859,000 Bitcoin, representing 4% of the total 21 million supply. The corporate treasury trend has gained momentum following regulatory clarity from the GENIUS Act and favorable legislative developments. Reuters reports also show that less than 5% of spot Bitcoin ETF assets are held by long-term institutional investors such as pension funds and endowments, with 10-15% owned by hedge funds or wealth management firms. The bulk of ETF ownership remains retail-driven, indicating substantial room for institutional growth as the adoption of ETFs matures. MicroStrategy continues to lead corporate Bitcoin adoption with over 600,000 BTC, while companies like Japan’s Metaplanet have recently purchased $93 million worth to become the fifth-largest corporate holder. Similarly, France’s Blockchain Group and the UK’s Smarter Web Company also made new treasury allocations worth $12.5 million and $24.3 million, respectively. The correlation between retail crypto ETF purchases and price rallies has intensified, with Vanda Research data showing heavy retail buying during Trump’s election victory and the recent legislative breakthrough. Corporate treasury companies have emerged as bigger demand drivers than traditional institutional investors. Bloomberg ETF analysts assign a 95% probability to the SEC approval of spot Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs this year, up from 90% previously amid growing institutional product optimism.

2025-07-21 10:55:14+00:00,Bitcoin Acquisition: Sequans’ Bold Move Fuels Massive Crypto Expansion,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: Sequans’ Bold Move Fuels Massive Crypto Expansion The world of corporate finance is undergoing a fascinating transformation, with an increasing number of publicly traded companies looking beyond traditional assets to bolster their balance sheets. In a move that has captured significant attention within the cryptocurrency community, Nasdaq-listed Sequans Communications, an innovator in the IoT semiconductor and module development space, has once again made headlines with its strategic Bitcoin acquisition . Sequans’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: A Deep Dive into Corporate Crypto Holdings In a bold demonstration of its conviction in digital assets, Sequans Communications recently announced the purchase of an additional 1,264 Bitcoin (BTC) for approximately $150 million. This significant investment, as reported by Bitcoin Magazine on X, substantially increases the company’s crypto treasury. With this latest acquisition, Sequans’ total Bitcoin holdings now stand at an impressive 2,317 BTC. What makes this Bitcoin acquisition even more intriguing is Sequans’ forward-looking strategy. The company has publicly stated its intentions to issue $380 million in convertible bonds, with the explicit purpose of funding further BTC acquisitions. This innovative approach highlights a growing trend among corporations to leverage diverse financial instruments to deepen their exposure to the digital asset market. Sequans’ Bitcoin Holdings at a Glance: Metric Details Latest BTC Purchase 1,264 BTC Cost of Latest Purchase $150 million Total BTC Holdings (Current) 2,317 BTC Planned Funding for Future Acquisitions $380 million via convertible bonds This systematic approach to accumulating Bitcoin suggests a long-term view from Sequans, positioning itself to benefit from the potential appreciation of the cryptocurrency while also diversifying its corporate treasury assets. Why are Companies Pursuing Bitcoin Acquisition as a Core Strategy? Sequans is not an isolated case. The past few years have seen a noticeable shift, with more and more corporations, from tech giants to traditional businesses, exploring or actively engaging in Bitcoin acquisition . But what exactly is driving this trend? Several compelling reasons underpin this evolving corporate treasury strategy: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its capped supply of 21 million coins offers a stark contrast to traditional currencies, which can be printed indefinitely. Store of Value: Often dubbed “digital gold,” Bitcoin’s characteristics as a decentralized, immutable, and globally accessible asset make it an attractive store of value, particularly for companies seeking to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Traditional corporate treasuries typically hold cash, short-term bonds, and other low-yield assets. Adding Bitcoin provides a new asset class that behaves differently from conventional investments, potentially enhancing portfolio resilience and returns. Technological Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and its willingness to engage with cutting-edge technologies. It positions the company at the forefront of the digital economy, potentially attracting tech-savvy investors and talent. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth. Companies acquiring Bitcoin anticipate benefiting from its potential price appreciation, adding a new revenue stream or value component to their balance sheet. Prominent examples like MicroStrategy, which has amassed tens of thousands of Bitcoin, and Tesla, which has held significant amounts, have paved the way, demonstrating that corporate Bitcoin acquisition is a viable and increasingly adopted strategy. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, companies undertaking Bitcoin acquisition also face a unique set of challenges. It’s crucial for any corporation considering this path to be fully aware of the potential pitfalls and to implement robust strategies to mitigate them. Key challenges include: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings. A sudden downturn can significantly impact a company’s balance sheet, leading to potential impairment charges and investor scrutiny. Managing this volatility requires a strong conviction and a long-term outlook. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different jurisdictions. Changes in regulations regarding taxation, accounting treatment, or asset classification could pose risks and necessitate adjustments to a company’s strategy.

ADA Price prediction suggests potential to reach $2.05 by year-end 2025. Long-term forecasts indicate ADA could hit $10.25 by 2030. After a slow start to the year, Cardano (ADA) Price is gaining momentum in Q2 2025. The recent Plomin Hard Fork unlocked full decentralized governance, strengthening investor confidence. Now, with rising institutional interest, ETF speculation, and a recovering crypto market, Cardano price prediction 2025 is once again a hot topic. Can ADA Price surge past $2 this year? Let’s explore key technicals, expert forecasts, and long-term projections up to 2050. Coinpedia’s Cardano Price Prediction 2025 Cardano (ADA) is predicted to reach a potential high of $2.05 in 2025 , driven by hopes of ETF approval, full decentralization after the Plomin Hard Fork, and increasing institutional interest. However, if ADA fails to hold above key support, it may range between $0.85 and $1.25 .

Over the past 22 days, ADA has surged nearly 47% from its $0.55 support level. By mid-July, ADA broke out of its falling wedge pattern, supported by renewed bullish momentum across the crypto market. Optimism around a potential ADA ETF, growing institutional interest, and Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high of $123,231 have further fueled the rally. ADA has now pierced the 200-day EMA and flipped it into support, signaling sustained bullish momentum and the potential for further gains. The key level to watch next is $0.83. If ADA holds and reclaims this level, a breakout above that range may lead to a rally toward $1.10, and if this resistance is cleared, ADA could aim for $1.32 by July end. Moreover, in the past 15-day span, Spot volume has peaked, active addresses (7d) have increased to 158.65K, and whale transactions are also pacing up. This is showing sustainable bullish momentum.

Unlike many other blockchains, Cardano gives more control to its users than to any central organization. This is reflected in CoinCarp’s rich list, where the top 100 addresses hold just 22% of the mainnet’s circulating supply, significantly lower than most other altcoins. Technically, if ADA price intends for a long-term rally, then a break above the $1.10–$1.20 range, strong retail participation will be key. A major catalyst could be the approval of an ADA ETF, expected by year-end, which could attract billions in inflows. Another would be a global attraction in the sector with BTC continuing northward moves. Therefore, if ADA holds above its Q1 2025 high, it has a strong chance of retesting the $2.05 mark before the year ends.

2025-07-21 11:15:00+00:00,"Altcoin Season Returns as Ether Treasuries Surge, BTC Dominance Slips: Crypto Daybook Americas","By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Altcoin season, a period marked by notable outperformance of ether (ETH) and other alternative cryptocurrencies relative to bitcoin (BTC), may finally be upon us. That''s the message from CoinMarketCap''s Altcoin Season Index, which has crossed above 50 for the first time since December. Ether and other layer-1 coins could be standout performers as a result of the passage of the GENIUS Act in the U.S. The Act provides regulatory framework for stablecoin issuance that could draw institutional demand to Ethereum and other layer-1 blockchains that host billions of dollars worth of the tokens. ""Treasuries are looking to ETH and other L1''s such as SOL, XRP and ADA to become what BTC is to the likes of Strategy and Metaplanet,"" Singapore-based QCP Capital said. Already, companies including SharpLink Gaming and Bitmine Immersion Technologies have said they plan to build ether treasuries in the way Strategy has with bitcoin. Together they hold more than 500,000 ETH. And just today, newly established The Ether Machine said it plans to go public with a 400,000 ETH treasury. The trend will likely accelerate if U.S. regulators approve BlackRock''s plan to add staking to its spot ether ETF. Staking could enhance ether''s appeal as an internet bond, prompting some funds to shift from bitcoin ETFs to ether ETFs. Technical charts tied to cross-pairs, such as ETH/BTC and XRP/BTC, are already hinting at big rallies ahead. Speaking of bitcoin, its momentum has weakened since early last week, leaving prices directionless near $120,000. That''s led to a sharp decline in its share of the crypto market. ""The fall in Bitcoin dominance is a major technical and psychological shift, suggesting a structural rotation into altcoins is underway,"" Valentine Fournier, lead analyst at BRN, said in an email. ""This transition is happening in the context of still-strong ETF flows, growing institutional participation, and the absence of any macro headwinds."" Still, on-chain activity continues to paint a bullish picture. According to Glassnode, wallets of all sizes are back in a BTC accumulation mode. ""Even >10K BTC whales are participating at levels last seen in Dec 2024. The alignment across wallet sizes suggests broad-based conviction behind the current BTC uptrend,"" Glassnode said on X. In key news, a report by Barron''s said the U.S. public pension giant OPERS disclosed in its Q2 2025 13F filing that it increased its holdings by 171,441 shares in Palantir and 21,499 shares in bitcoin holder Strategy.

How high can this $SOL pump go? Is $SOL about to take over the reins from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)? $SOL price nears top of rising wedge - pullback? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $SOL reveals a nice rise inside an ascending wedge, which has taken out the $184 resistance. However, caution should certainly be employed from here. Given that the price has reached the top of the wedge, and the indicators on the Stochastic RSI are at the top, this could be an ideal place for a pullback. Whether the pullback will just take the price back to the bottom of the wedge, and the $184 resistance level, in order to confirm this as support, remains to be seen. Retest of $184 level is favourite to take place Source: TradingView The daily chart illustrates that an all-important higher high has just been made by $SOL bulls. However, it does look more obvious in this time frame that a retest of $184 will need to take place before the price can go higher. The indicator lines for the Stochastic RSI may come back down to the 80.00 level at least, and could then bounce back up again, signalling continued buying. $SOL W pattern on 2-week chart Source: TradingView Zooming much further out into the 2-week view, this chart looks excellent for the longer term prognosis for $SOL . All looks as though it hinges on $SOL bulls being able to claim the $184 resistance level as support. If they can do so, a W chart pattern would be likely to play out, potentially taking the $SOL price above the last $252 resistance. SOL/ETH turnaround about to take place?

Is this turnaround currently taking place, or is $SOL just confirming the breakdown of the broadening wedge? The fact that the indicator lines in the Stochastic RSI may be about to flip bullish for $SOL is a potential big factor in the $SOL bulls’ favour.

2025-07-21 11:29:57+00:00,Altcoins Fuel Wall Street’s Infinite Money Glitch — Best Crypto to Buy Now,"Wall Street’s no rookie when it comes to spinning complex money moves into fat stacks—and now it’s running the same high-level play in crypto. And no, it’s not just riding the $BTC wave. This slick new hustle is being dubbed the “Infinite Money Glitch.” Here’s the cheat code: a company raises capital, either by selling shares or locking in loans.Then, it plows that cash into crypto, pumping its balance sheet and juicing the stock price in the process. With the market hyped and the stock flying, it raises even more money. Rinse. Repeat. Such a shift sets the stage for the best altcoins to buy , like Bitcoin ($HYPER) , Best Wallet Token ($BEST) , and Conflux ($CFX), because they offer real utility beyond speculation. Altcoin Stocks Explode Over 226% in 30 Days Wall Street’s old tricks still work—they’ve just been upgraded for the crypto era. Debt, stock offerings, clever contracts… those same tools that fueled traditional gains are now being pointed straight at digital assets. One of the OGs of this play is Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). Back in 2020, they made headlines by going all in on $BTC—not just as a hedge, but as a profit engine. And they didn’t stop. Even today, Strategy keeps the flywheel spinning: sell shares, issue debt, scoop up more $BTC. It’s a rinse-and-repeat model that’s transformed the company into one of the biggest Bitcoin whales on the planet. As of now, Strategy holds ~601,550 $BTC, valued at ~$70.94B, with an average purchase price of ~$71,290 per $BTC. Its holdings are up by 65.41% all-time, representing a whopping ~$28B gain. Other companies have also noticed the benefits of holding crypto and copied similar strategies, not just using $BTC, but altcoins like $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP. For instance, SharpLink Gaming is the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, currently holding over 280K $ETH, worth around $1B. It recently increased its authorized stock sale limit by $5B , from $1B to $6B, and plans to use most of that capital to buy more $ETH. According to Animoca Brands’ research, when a company announces it is adding altcoins to its balance sheet, its stock prices jump by ~161% on average on the same day. The next day, they were still up ~150%, over 185% after a week, and 226% thirty days later. Those are massive returns in a short period, so it’s no wonder investors are taking notice of altcoins. And for altcoins that set themselves apart with real-world use cases and active communities, such as $HYPER , $BEST , and $CFX, this could be a major boost. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Targets Faster, Cheaper Transactions & DeFi Utility on Bitcoin by Q3 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is making waves in the altcoin space with the upcoming launch of its Bitcoin Layer 2 network, set to support smart contracts in Q3 2025. The project’s ultimate mission is to unlock real utility for Bitcoin by enabling secure Web3 integration, super-fast transactions, and greater scalability. By leveraging the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , the Layer 2 aims to make wrapped $BTC usable across dApps, DeFi tools, DAOs, NFTs, and other blockchain-based experiences that Ethereum has traditionally dominated. It will also include a Canonical Bridge for fast and secure transfers between Bitcoin’s L1 and its L2, without compromising security or performance. Signaling growing confidence in the Layer 2’s vision, $HYPER has raised over $3.9M on presale, with major contributions from crypto whales ( $74.9K , $54.1, and $53.9K !). $HYPER also attracts attention to granting holders lower gas fees, governance rights, and sizable staking rewards – currently at a 241% APY. You can buy $HYPER on presale for just $0.01235. The L2 mainnet launch could push it to $0.32 , making now a great time to get involved for possible returns exceeding 2,400%. 2. Best Wallet ($BEST) – Raises $14M+ on Presale Ahead of Major Crypto Wallet Upgrades Best Wallet Token ($BEST) has already raised over $14M on presale over being the foundation of the Best Wallet app – a non-custodial crypto wallet designed for speed, privacy, and powerful Web3 access. Built for both crypto degens and professionals, Best Wallet allows users to manage their crypto without requiring KYC verification , making it the #1 anonymous crypto wallet . The app currently supports top chains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Solana, with plans to expand to over 60 networks. By doing so, you can manage your assets across multiple chains without juggling different platforms and wallets. With built-in tools for buying, storing, swapping, staking, and tracking over 1K digital assets, it delivers a seamless, all-in-one experience with real-time insights and customization. Fiat onramps are integrated through Onramper, offering top-tier exchange rates and low fees. And soon, it’ll also launch Best Card, a crypto debit card facilitating easy daily crypto spending.

But among altcoins, Solana caught the brightest spark,and it lit up fast. Short Squeeze Frenzy: $11M Liquidated The rally wasn’t without casualties.

Funding rates flipped aggressive. Margin calls rang out across major exchanges. The message was clear: don’t fade Solana when it’s on a tear.

Solana’s breakout isn’t just a spike, it’s a statement. From a once-dismissed altcoin to a market leader, SOL has climbed its way into the conversation alongside the big names. Yes, the volatility remains. Yes, corrections can sting. But for now, Solana is roaring. It’s at $191 today. The only question left is,where’s it going next?

The total crypto market capitalization has climbed to $3.94 trillion, up 1.17%. Meanwhile, the 24-hour trading volume stands at $196.07 billion, marking a significant 43% surge. The Fear & Greed Index reads a greed-driven score of 67. And the altcoin season index scores 57, confirming rising altcoin strength. A major catalyst is the regulatory breakthrough that has energized the altcoin market, evidenced by Bitcoin’s dominance falling from 63.76% to 60%. Moreover, the altcoin cap reclaiming an 8-year trendline. Curious about where the blue-chip coins are heading next? Read this Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP price prediction for short-term targets Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction: Bitcoin is showing signs of strength despite a 2.53% dip over the past week, currently trading at $118,681.99. This setup, combined with strong ETF demand and BlockInc’s recent inclusion in the S&P 500 index, signals rising institutional confidence. Talking about trade, the volume has jumped nearly 40% in the last 24 hours, supporting the possibility of a breakout. If Bitcoin can close above the short-term resistance at $119,700, it could target $121,200. However, if the bullish pattern fails to hold, a downside move toward $115,000 could come into play. Ethereum (ETH) Price Prediction: Ethereum continues to outperform BTC, climbing over 23% in the past seven days and now changing hands at $3,776.02. On the chart, ETH is hovering just below short-term resistance at $3,820. This move is underpinned by a record-breaking $2.12 billion in weekly ETF inflows, which is an ATH. The RSI remains comfortably bullish but not overheated, while rising trading volume confirms the strength behind the move. If Ethereum price breaks above $3,820 , it is likely to surge toward $4,096 in the coming days. Contrarily, if the rally stalls, support levels at $3,680 and $3,550 could catch any pullbacks and offer fresh long opportunities. Ripple XRP Price Prediction: XRP has maintained a solid uptrend over the past week, gaining 18.59% and currently priced at $3.53. The token is trading just under the key resistance level at $3.60, which has capped upward momentum several times this year. However, the recent signing of the GENIUS Act by President Trump has invigorated market sentiment around Ripple’s ecosystem and stablecoin integration, driving institutional inflows. On the technical front, XRP is flashing a bullish RSI at 84. A clean breakout above $3.60 could push the XRP price toward $3.75, and then to $4.004 . If it fails to break this barrier, XRP may retest $3.42, with firmer support resting at $3.30. That being said, a cascade of sell-offs could bring the price to $2.882. FAQs Why is Bitcoin consolidating near ATH instead of surging? Bitcoin is digesting previous gains and consolidating within a bullish pattern. Why is Ethereum price going up?

Although the Ethereum price maintained a sluggish trend before, it gained huge bullish momentum and broke above the local threshold of $3800.

Now that the BTC price rally seems to have cooled a bit, altcoins have gained traction, igniting a strong Altseason. Retailers Returning to the Market Bitcoin has manifested significant strength after undergoing a breakout during Q4, 2024. The dominance surged, which hinted towards a massive influx of liquidity to the star token. Meanwhile, the trend changed as the BTC price marked new highs as the liquidity flow seemed to have started from Bitcoin to Ethereum. As a result, the ETH price has started to rise, which has attracted significant attention from the retailers. The above chart shows the search trend of the term ‘Altcoins’ which has risen significantly since the start of the month. The queries related to Altseason, memecoins, and tokens like Solana, XRP, Binance Coin, Avalanche and Uniswap have been on a constant rise.

This suggests the altcoins are yet to rise; however, the altcoin market cap reclaimed key trendlines, and Glassnode data is flashing early rotation.

2025-07-21 11:53:40+00:00,“1 BTC Per Day” Is Over: IMF Reveals El Salvador Halted Bitcoin Buys Since February,"El Salvador has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February 2025, according to a new report released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on July 15. The disclosure directly contradicts President Nayib Bukele’s long-standing public claim that his government has been buying one Bitcoin per day. The IMF’s findings were included in the first formal review of the country’s Bitcoin program since El Salvador secured a $1.4 billion loan agreement in December 2024. IMF Lauds El Salvador’s Bitcoin Reforms, Confirms Policy Shift A letter signed by Central Bank President Douglas Pablo Rodríguez Fuentes and Finance Minister Jerson Rogelio Posada Molina confirmed that “the stock of Bitcoins held by the public sector remains unchanged.” The IMF report also revealed that El Salvador is moving to scale back its public involvement in Bitcoin-related services. One of the key changes includes reducing the role of the Chivo wallet, the state-backed digital asset platform, and ultimately ending its operation by July 2025. The Chivo wallet, once promoted as a centerpiece of the country’s Bitcoin adoption, will be shut down from public control, and the IMF clarified that while the wallet will remain operational, it must be fully privatized and no longer run on government funds. The report noted that although on-chain activity shows BTC moving between wallets, these are not new acquisitions. Instead, the transactions reflect internal transfers between cold and hot wallets. The IMF emphasized that these movements had led to a “misinterpretation” of El Salvador’s Bitcoin activity. Officials further argue that reallocated reserves or assets obtained through legal seizures do not qualify as state-backed Bitcoin buys. According to the El Salvador Bitcoin Office , El Salvador currently holds about 6,244 BTC, worth roughly $742 million. While some reports suggested an 8 BTC increase last week, the IMF attributes this to technical accounting, not fresh buys. El Salvador has approved amendments to its Bitcoin laws, aligning with a deal struck with the IMF to scale back its crypto exposure. #ElSalvador #Bitcoin https://t.co/2BDlo3RCGg — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 30, 2025 The IMF praised the updated Bitcoin policy for reducing fiscal risk and strengthening transparency. It said these steps were helping to stabilize inflation and restore macroeconomic stability in the country. Official vs. On-Chain: The Bitcoin Mystery Behind El Salvador’s Treasury Despite growing public interest in sovereign Bitcoin reserves, the IMF is pushing El Salvador to treat BTC as a financial asset with risk exposure, not as a currency. As part of the agreement, Bitcoin is no longer considered mandatory legal tender. While the Salvadoran government insists it is still “stacking sats,” the IMF’s statement indicates otherwise. The divergence in interpretation has added fuel to a broader debate around sovereign BTC holdings.

For now, El Salvador’s public BTC balance appears to be holding steady, with no new government-funded purchases. The IMF says the country is sticking to its agreement.

2025-07-21 12:00:19+00:00,Crypto Tax Cuts Could Unleash Bitcoin Buying Spree In Japan,"Japan’s tough approach to crypto taxes is holding back both buyers and sellers. A survey of 1,500 adults in April found that just 13% currently own Bitcoin , Ethereum or other cryptoassets. Many say they’d be ready to dive in—if only Tokyo eased the tax burden. Majority Back Flat Tax According to the Japan Blockchain Association, 84% of the 191 people who already hold crypto would buy more if profits faced a flat 20% levy. And 12% of the 1,309 non‑holders said they’d start buying bitcoin or other cryptos under the same rule. That’s a big shift from today’s system, where crypto gains land under “other income” on tax returns. Right now, profits from bitcoin or crypto can be taxed at rates up to 55%, depending on your bracket. That’s far higher than the 10–20% flat rate that applies to stocks in many other countries. Based on reports, the JBA is pushing to move crypto into the same capital gains category, arguing it would boost trading volumes on local exchanges. Survey Shows Simple Rules Appeal Three quarters of survey participants said they’d rather have taxes withheld at the source when they sell bitcoins, instead of filing separate paperwork. The JBA has asked Tokyo to let traders choose whether to pay at the point of sale or when they file their annual return. That flexibility could ease headaches for both hobby investors and pros. The poll looked deeper into why some people still won’t touch crypto. Just 8% blamed high taxes, while 61% said they don’t feel they know enough about digital coins. The sample was 60% male and 40% female, with an average age of 38. Students made up 5.3% of the group, and 213 people said they were unemployed. FSA Considers Broader Reforms According to reports from the financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency is weighing a proposal to shift bitcoin under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If approved, that would officially treat digital assets as financial products—and could pave the way for a unified 20% tax by as early as next year. Exchanges like bitFlyer already see Ethereum trades account for almost half of their volume. Any change could reshape Japan’s crypto market—by making it simpler to trade, and by bringing more people into the fold.

2025-07-21 12:01:52+00:00,"Bitcoin Will Reach $140K in the Mid Term, but Will You Benefit? (Analyst)","Bitcoin (BTC) is flirting with $120,000 again, but there’s a growing tug-of-war between leveraged optimism and quiet spot distribution behind the scenes. This is according to pseudonymous analyst Mr. Wall Street, who warned on July 20 that while short-term momentum remains intact, BTC’s mid-term trajectory may be weakened as long-term holders start to cash out. Bull Case Amid Bearish Undercurrents In his assessment , Mr. Wall Street noted that the world’s number one cryptocurrency has secured its local bottom around $116,000, following a predicted pullback. He believes the asset will rise to between $120,000 and $123,500 in the short term, before a mid-term run pushes it towards the $133,000 to $140,000 range. However, the market watcher tempered his positive outlook with a critical on-chain observation: wallets that accumulated heavily at the $16,000 to $20,000 cycle lows in August 2022 have started offloading spot holdings, a pattern he says is eerily similar to what preceded the last cycle top. If that setup repeats, their selling this week could signal a potential market top forming by late October or early November. “It’s clear that these individuals know how to play this game,” noted the expert. “The fact they have already started to reduce the size of their own spot positions, after holding for three years, is a sign that they are anticipating a cycle top coming soon.” His assessment isn’t far from that shared by technical analyst CryptoVizArt, who cited CryptoQuant data showing that BTC reserves on centralized exchanges have risen to their highest since June 25. Historically, such increases often suggest growing sell-side pressure and typically come before local tops. “The market is getting weaker, regardless of what the charts are showing us,” warned Mr. Wall Street on X. Macro Crosswinds The immediate outlook still faces a few tests, including the July FOMC meeting, even though no rate cut is expected. According to Mr. Wall Street, markets are pricing in potential September cuts, which could fuel a pre-meeting pump followed by a “sell the news” event. Meanwhile, Bitcoin was trading at $119,269 at the time of this writing, up a slight 0.9% over 24 hours but down 2.9% over the past week. Additionally, it gained 9.4% over two weeks and 15.3% in the past 30 days, but remains 2.9% below its July 14 all-time high. The post Bitcoin Will Reach $140K in the Mid Term, but Will You Benefit?

It’s the result of a reverse merger between The Ether Reserve, a crypto startup, and Dynamix Corp, a blank-check company that saw its shares more than double in premarket trading after the deal was made public, according to data from Yahoo Finance. The new entity will use the ticker ETHM, and is expected to begin trading before the end of 2025. Once this merger closes in the fourth quarter, Ether Machine will become the largest public vehicle giving institutions direct access to ETH , the world’s second-biggest crypto. That balance sheet play is the same exact game Michael Saylor ran with Strategy and Bitcoin, except now it’s Ethereum that’s getting the big-boy treatment. Kraken, Pantera and Blockchain.com pump $800 million into deal The capital behind this venture is loud and deep. Investors including Kraken, Pantera Capital, and Blockchain.com contributed over $800 million through an upsized common stock offering that padded the total raise beyond $1.6 billion. Running the show is Andrew Keys, the new chairman. He used to be an executive at ConsenSys, the Ethereum software company built by Joseph Lubin, one of Ethereum’s co-founders. Andrew’s appointment brings a face to the project that knows the Ethereum ecosystem inside-out. Over the last few months, a wave of crypto companies have been experimenting with similar strategies, public listings that let traditional finance bet on tokens through stocks. Most of those efforts have focused on Bitcoin, but ETH has been catching up fast. It just hit a seven-month high on Friday, as Cryptopolitan reported . Ethereum leads global crypto inflows as U.S. dominates market Right now, Ether is having its moment. Investment products tied to it just pulled in a record $2.12 billion in inflows, nearly double the previous high of $1.2 billion. That makes it the top-performing crypto by institutional interest over the past week. To be clear, Ether has now logged 13 straight weeks of inflows, accounting for 23% of its total assets under management. For 2025 alone, it has already brought in $6.2 billion, beating its entire 2024 total. Weekly crypto asset flow. Source: Coinshares Overall, last week logged $4.39 billion in inflows across all crypto investment products, beating the previous record of $4.27 billion, which happened just after the 2024 U.S. election. Those numbers mark the 14th straight week of gains, and bring this year’s total to $27 billion. Total assets under management now sit at $220 billion, another all-time high. The appetite is real. Most of that capital came from the U.S. , which saw $4.36 billion in inflows just this past week. Other regions also posted gains. Switzerland took in $47.3 million, Hong Kong added $14.1 million, and Australia followed with $17.3 million. Meanwhile, Brazil and Germany saw outflows of $28.1 million and $15.5 million. Bitcoin still brought in more overall this week, with $2.2 billion in inflows, but that’s a drop from $2.7 billion the week before. And unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin’s weekly exchange-traded product volumes now account for 55% of its total exchange volume. A big reason for ETH’s upswing is the improved regulatory tone in the U.S. around dollar-pegged stablecoins, which mostly operate on the Ethereum blockchain.

2025-07-21 12:10:00+00:00,Best crypto for 2025? MUTM could deliver 1000% growth shortly,"The next big winner in crypto might not come from a familiar name like BTC or ETH. Instead, eyes are turning toward a bold new player in the DeFi space— Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Combining real-world use cases, stablecoin innovation, and a dual lending engine, MUTM is entering the final stages of its presale phase 5 at just $0.03, with over $12.7 million already raised. With more than 85% of tokens sold to 13,750+ holders, this final discounted phase is ending fast. The price is set to rise to $0.035 next, marking the last chance to enter before a wave of post-listing momentum. The total token supply is capped at 4 billion, with each phase of the presale structured to reward early adoption. Momentum is growing rapidly, and analysts now consider this token one of the strongest breakout candidates for 2025. While most tokens rely solely on speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a foundation around sustainable yield, secure lending, and protocol-driven value flows. Stablecoin-driven lending meets real yield utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not following the usual playbook. The platform is constructing a decentralized borrowing system powered by a native stablecoin that only mints when overcollateralized loans are initiated. That means users will be able to lock bluechip crypto like ETH or BTC as collateral and mint stablecoins without selling their assets. Once loans are repaid—or liquidated if undercollateralized—the stablecoins are automatically burned. This system ensures the token remains tightly pegged to $1 while offering liquidity to holders without sacrificing long-term positions or triggering tax events. The peg will be maintained not only through strict overcollateralization and burning logic but also by dynamic interest rates set via protocol governance. When the stablecoin trades above $1, borrowing interest will drop to encourage supply. When it trades below $1, interest will increase to contract supply. This elegant balancing mechanism, combined with arbitrage opportunities, forms a sturdy foundation for the ecosystem. In addition, depositors receive mtTokens, which represent their share in lending pools and accrue interest. These mtTokens can be staked into dedicated smart contracts to earn rewards in MUTM tokens that will be bought back from the open market. This buyback system turns the protocol into a self-reinforcing flywheel, where token demand is fueled directly by platform revenue, adding another layer of yield for long-term holders. Flexible lending models for all investor types Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will support both P2C and P2P lending models, giving users a range of tools to suit their needs. The P2C model will be ideal for passive investors seeking predictable returns. A lender supplying 1,000 AVAX at a 70% loan-to-value ratio will be able to earn an 8% APY, accumulating 80 AVAX annually in interest. Smart contracts will manage the loan matching and execution, with mtTokens issued as proof of deposit. In contrast, the P2P system will enable direct agreements between lenders and borrowers, focusing on high-risk or speculative tokens. For instance, a user holding $6,000 worth of FLOKI will be able to access a $2,400 USDT loan with 30-day repayment terms, depending on lender preferences. This will unlock liquidity opportunities for holders of volatile meme or micro-cap coins—assets that are often ignored by traditional DeFi lenders. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also integrating Layer 2 blockchain architecture to eliminate congestion and reduce transaction costs. Users will experience fast settlement speeds and near-zero gas fees, making daily lending and borrowing practical and cost-effective. The roadmap is well-structured and includes four defined phases: the presale, smart contract development, beta launch, and full mainnet rollout. Each stage is being supported by institutional-grade security measures. The protocol has undergone a full audit by CertiK, scoring 95 in Token Scan and 77.5 on the Skynet system. Alongside this, a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty is active to encourage external reviews, while a $100,000 token giveaway rewards community engagement. One leading crypto analyst—known for accurately predicting Solana’s 20x rally and XRP’s ETF-driven breakout—now projects that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reach $0.90 by Q4 2025. That’s a 30x gain from the current price and puts MUTM in line with some of the most legendary returns in the space. Whales who had previously sought shelter in Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH) is now beginning to shift positions, and it’s becoming increasingly clear that MUTM will be the next magnet for capital rotation. The presale clock is ticking, and with the price set to jump from $0.03 to $0.035 in the next few days, this is the moment smart investors are acting. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is no longer under the radar—it’s aiming for the spotlight, and 2025 could be the year it dominates.

2025-07-21 12:10:38+00:00,Bitcoin Undervalued: PlanB Reveals the Explosive 10x Potential,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Undervalued: PlanB Reveals the Explosive 10x Potential Is Bitcoin truly worth far more than its current price? Prominent analyst PlanB certainly thinks so, igniting a fervent discussion about why Bitcoin is undervalued by a staggering 10 times. This bold assertion isn’t just a casual remark; it stems from a deep dive into market dynamics, scarcity, and a comparison with traditional safe-haven assets like gold. For anyone navigating the exciting, yet often perplexing, world of cryptocurrencies, understanding this perspective is crucial. It challenges conventional thinking and invites us to consider Bitcoin’s potential through a different lens. Why is Bitcoin Undervalued According to PlanB? PlanB, widely recognized for his pioneering work on the Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model for Bitcoin, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to share his compelling analysis. His core argument revolves around a direct comparison between Bitcoin (BTC) and gold, two assets often pitted against each other as stores of value. At the heart of his thesis is a simple, yet profound, observation: gold’s colossal market capitalization dwarfs Bitcoin’s, despite Bitcoin possessing superior scarcity characteristics. Let’s break down PlanB’s primary points: Market Cap Disparity: Gold, a millennia-old store of wealth, boasts an approximate market capitalization of $20 trillion. In stark contrast, Bitcoin’s market cap hovers around $2 trillion. This means gold is currently valued at ten times more than Bitcoin. Superior Scarcity: While gold is considered scarce, Bitcoin’s scarcity is demonstrably higher. PlanB highlights this through their respective Stock-to-Flow (S2F) ratios. Gold’s S2F ratio is around 60, meaning it would take 60 years of current production to match the existing supply. Bitcoin, on the other hand, boasts an S2F ratio of 120, implying its new supply creation is half as much relative to its existing stock, making it twice as scarce as gold. Consider this side-by-side comparison: Asset Approximate Market Cap Stock-to-Flow Ratio (S2F) Scarcity Relative to Gold Gold $20 Trillion 60 1x Bitcoin (BTC) $2 Trillion 120 2x PlanB’s conclusion is straightforward: if Bitcoin is twice as scarce as gold, yet only commands one-tenth of its market value, then logically, Bitcoin is undervalued by at least a factor of ten. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s a quantitative assessment based on fundamental properties of both assets. Decoding the Bitcoin Undervalued Thesis: What Does This Mean for Investors? The assertion that Bitcoin is undervalued carries significant weight, particularly for those looking to understand its long-term investment potential. If PlanB’s analysis holds true, the implications for future price appreciation could be substantial. However, like any investment thesis, it comes with both promising benefits and important considerations. Potential Benefits for Investors: Significant Upside Potential: The most immediate benefit is the prospect of substantial returns. If Bitcoin were to close the valuation gap with gold, even partially, its price would see exponential growth from current levels. Reinforcement of the Digital Gold Narrative: PlanB’s comparison strengthens the argument that Bitcoin is a superior form of digital gold. Its verifiable scarcity, ease of transfer, and resistance to censorship make it an attractive alternative in an increasingly digital world. Long-Term Investment Horizon: This thesis encourages a long-term perspective. Rather than focusing on daily price fluctuations, investors are prompted to consider Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition over years, even decades. Challenges and Considerations: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is renowned for its price volatility. While the long-term outlook might be bullish, short-term swings can be dramatic and challenging for many investors. Regulatory Landscape: The global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Unfavorable regulations in major economies could impact adoption and market sentiment. Adoption Rate: While growing, Bitcoin’s adoption as a global currency or widespread store of value is still nascent compared to gold. Its full potential hinges on broader acceptance and integration into financial systems. External Factors: Geopolitical events, technological advancements (or setbacks), and shifts in macroeconomic policy can all influence Bitcoin’s price independent of its intrinsic value. For investors, the actionable insight is not simply to buy Bitcoin because it’s deemed undervalued. Instead, it’s to use this analysis as a foundation for deeper research. Understanding the underlying reasons for its perceived undervaluation, alongside the inherent risks, allows for a more informed and strategic approach to portfolio allocation.

Despite his long-term bullish stance on these assets, he now signals a strategic pause in buying and advises caution in the face of what he describes as an imminent economic correction. With Bitcoin recently surging past $120,000 to an all-time high, Kiyosaki believes the market may be entering dangerously inflated territory. A bubble ready to burst Kiyosaki’s latest statements highlight his concern that a broader economic bubble is on the verge of bursting. If that happens, he predicts it will not just impact traditional financial markets but also safe-haven and digital assets alike. Robert Kiyosaki has gone on record saying that when the global economy enters crisis mode, “odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too.” Robert Kiyosaki @theRealKiyosaki · Follow BUBBLES are about to start BUSTING.When bubbles bust odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will bust too.Good news.If prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin crash….

In his view, the key is not avoiding these assets, but knowing when to hold back and when to buy in aggressively during downturns. Strategic pause in buying after Bitcoin hit new ATH When Bitcoin crossed $117,000 earlier this month, Kiyosaki expressed excitement and said he would buy one more coin. However, as Bitcoin surpassed $120,000 shortly afterwards, he announced a change of course. He declared that he would pause any further purchases until there was more clarity about the economic direction. Kiyosaki emphasised that despite the potential of Bitcoin reaching $200,000 or even $1 million, now is not the time for greed. He referenced the saying, “pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered,” to warn against overexposure in a frothy market. For now, he prefers to wait for what he sees as an inevitable crash—after which he plans to buy more at discounted prices. Bitcoin dominance and market shifts While Bitcoin hit historic highs, its market dominance began to shrink. In just two weeks, its share of the total crypto market has dropped from 67% to 61%. During this period, altcoins like Ethereum and XRP gained traction , posting massive gains. This shift is largely attributed to growing investor appetite for diversification and increased risk tolerance. Additionally, gold has outpaced Bitcoin in 2025 so far, rising nearly 28% since the beginning of the year. While Bitcoin briefly overtook gold in performance, the balance quickly shifted back in favour of the precious metal. This back-and-forth has added another layer of complexity for investors deciding where to allocate capital in an uncertain economic climate. Cautious optimism for the long term Despite warning of a potential crash, Kiyosaki remains bullish on the long-term value of Bitcoin. Kiyosaki continues to project that the digital asset could reach $1 million in the future. However, he strongly advises newcomers to start small and educate themselves thoroughly before diving in. He even suggested that buying fractions of Bitcoin, satoshis, is a prudent first step. Kiyosaki also referenced Warren Buffett’s strategy of holding massive cash reserves, hinting that many smart investors may be waiting for distressed opportunities before entering the market again. In his words, the real winners will be those who buy after the “hogs” have been slaughtered and prices have crashed. While some may view Kiyosaki’s warnings as overly cautious or even contradictory, Kiyosaki’s evolving stance reflects the complexity and volatility of today’s markets.

2025-07-21 12:25:28+00:00,"Shocking: Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $118,000","BitcoinWorld Shocking: Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $118,000 The cryptocurrency market is once again sending ripples through the investor community, as the Bitcoin price experienced a notable dip, falling below the critical $118,000 mark. For many, this sudden shift prompts questions about market stability and future trajectories. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious newcomer, understanding these movements in the Bitcoin price is essential for navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Movement According to recent market monitoring, the Bitcoin price has indeed dropped, with reports indicating it trading at $117,981.03 on the Binance USDT market. This movement, while perhaps unsettling for some, is a characteristic feature of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional assets, digital currencies like Bitcoin are known for their rapid fluctuations, driven by a myriad of factors ranging from global economic sentiment to specific technological developments. To put this in perspective, let’s consider the immediate data: Current Trading Price: $117,981.03 Exchange Monitored: Binance USDT market Key Threshold Breached: $118,000 This particular drop highlights the constant ebb and flow that defines the journey of the Bitcoin price . It’s a reminder that while Bitcoin has shown incredible long-term growth, short-term volatility remains a constant companion. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall? Unpacking the Factors When the Bitcoin price takes a dip, it’s rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s often a confluence of macroeconomic indicators, market sentiment, and specific industry news. Here are some common factors that could influence such a move: Global Economic Climate Broader economic concerns, such as inflation fears, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to de-risk. This means moving away from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies towards more traditional, perceived-as-safer investments. When the global economic outlook becomes uncertain, the Bitcoin price can often feel the ripple effect. Regulatory Scrutiny News or rumors of increased regulatory scrutiny in major markets can also impact the Bitcoin price . Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate digital assets, and any perceived tightening of rules can trigger sell-offs as investors anticipate potential restrictions or compliance burdens. Whale Movements and Market Liquidity Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence the Bitcoin price with their buying or selling activities.

BitcoinWorld Shocking: Bitcoin Price Plunges Below $118,000 The cryptocurrency market is once again sending ripples through the investor community, as the Bitcoin price experienced a notable dip, falling below the critical $118,000 mark. For many, this sudden shift prompts questions about market stability and future trajectories. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a curious newcomer, understanding these movements in the Bitcoin price is essential for navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Movement According to recent market monitoring, the Bitcoin price has indeed dropped, with reports indicating it trading at $117,981.03 on the Binance USDT market. This movement, while perhaps unsettling for some, is a characteristic feature of the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional assets, digital currencies like Bitcoin are known for their rapid fluctuations, driven by a myriad of factors ranging from global economic sentiment to specific technological developments. To put this in perspective, let’s consider the immediate data: Current Trading Price: $117,981.03 Exchange Monitored: Binance USDT market Key Threshold Breached: $118,000 This particular drop highlights the constant ebb and flow that defines the journey of the Bitcoin price . It’s a reminder that while Bitcoin has shown incredible long-term growth, short-term volatility remains a constant companion. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Fall? Unpacking the Factors When the Bitcoin price takes a dip, it’s rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s often a confluence of macroeconomic indicators, market sentiment, and specific industry news. Here are some common factors that could influence such a move: Global Economic Climate Broader economic concerns, such as inflation fears, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to de-risk. This means moving away from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies towards more traditional, perceived-as-safer investments. When the global economic outlook becomes uncertain, the Bitcoin price can often feel the ripple effect. Regulatory Scrutiny News or rumors of increased regulatory scrutiny in major markets can also impact the Bitcoin price . Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate digital assets, and any perceived tightening of rules can trigger sell-offs as investors anticipate potential restrictions or compliance burdens. Whale Movements and Market Liquidity Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence the Bitcoin price with their buying or selling activities. A substantial sell-off by a whale or a group of whales can quickly increase supply on exchanges, leading to a downward price pressure. Additionally, market liquidity – how easily an asset can be bought or sold without affecting its price – plays a role. Lower liquidity can amplify price movements.

2025-07-21 12:30:44+00:00,Crypto ETPs See Record $4.4B Inflows as Bitcoin and Ether Surge,"Crypto investment products saw record-breaking inflows last week, marking the 14th consecutive week of gains for crypto ETPs. According to CoinShares, global crypto ETPs recorded $4.4 billion in inflows for the trading week ending Friday, driven by strong market momentum and renewed investor interest. The inflows came as Bitcoin surged past $122,000 for the first time on July 14, before pulling back to an intraweek low of around $116,000 and closing the week near $120,000, data from CoinGecko showed. With the latest gains, year-to-date inflows in crypto ETPs reached a new high of $27 billion, while total assets under management in crypto ETPs crossed $220 billion for the first time. Ether ETPs Hit Record Inflow Ether-focused investment products were a major contributor to the latest inflows, with Ether ETPs posting double their previous weekly record at $2.12 billion. The year-to-date inflows for Ether ETPs reached $6.2 billion, surpassing the total inflows recorded for 2024, according to CoinShares’ head of research James Butterfill. The surge in inflows coincided with ETH crossing $3,500 for the first time since early January, a significant recovery from April’s lows when ETH dropped below $1,500 amid market pressure . Butterfill noted that the past 13 weeks of consistent inflows now represent 23% of Ethereum’s assets under management in ETPs, indicating a strong return of investor confidence in Ether as market conditions improved. Bitcoin and Altcoins Maintain Momentum Despite Minor Outflows Bitcoin ETPs also maintained solid inflows, recording $2.2 billion last week, which accounted for 50% of total crypto ETP inflows. The resilience in Bitcoin inflows came even as BTC hit new all-time highs, contrasting with the brief slowdown seen earlier in July as investors grew cautious at higher price levels. Other altcoins such as Solana, XRP, and Sui also saw notable inflows of $39 million, $36 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, reflecting broader interest across the crypto sector. Despite the strong overall inflows, some US issuers recorded minor outflows during the week. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest led the losses, posting $120 million in outflows, including an $8.7 million sell-off from its ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). Fidelity Investments and ProShares experienced outflows of $49 million and $25 million, respectively, while CoinShares recorded minor outflows of $25 million, adding to $18 million in outflows from the previous week. The continued strength in crypto ETP inflows, paired with Bitcoin and Ether’s market resilience, signals sustained institutional interest in crypto assets despite minor corrections and profit-taking, setting a strong foundation for the coming months in the crypto investment landscape.

As Bitcoin paused, altcoins surged aggressively, with many large caps like Ethereum and XRP outperforming for the first time in months . This shift in momentum triggered a 6.9 percent decline in Bitcoin dominance, the largest since December 2023, suggesting the market is rotating into higher beta assets, a hallmark of mid-cycle expansion phases. Despite Bitcoin’s consolidation, it continues to trade well above the realised cost basis of 95 percent of holders, highlighting that most of the supply sits in profit. This historically marks late-stage bullish phases where profit-taking by short-term holders intensifies. Long-term holders have started distributing coins for the first time since early 2024, while ETFs, retail, and newer market participants absorb that supply. This natural rotation between holder classes reflects a maturing cycle , but it also raises near-term fragility, especially if buyer momentum fades. Bitcoin briefly pulled back to $115,820 after testing the +1 standard deviation band (σ) above the Short-Term Holder cost basis at $120,000, a zone that historically attracts distribution. For the rally to continue, the next resistance lies at the +2σ band near $136,000 —a level associated with overbought conditions and peak market exuberance. Sustaining momentum to reach that level will likely require renewed institutional inflows or strong macro tailwinds to absorb profit-taking pressure. For now, the baton has passed to altcoins, but Bitcoin’s structural strength remains intact—just entering a more delicate, reactive phase. In the macro economy it is becoming clearer that tariff-driven inflation is surfacing, with June’s CPI rising 0.3 percent and core inflation up 2.9 percent annually, as higher import costs from China and other key US trading partners push up prices in consumer goods like appliances and apparel. While shelter and services inflation shows mild easing, producer price data points to rising upstream costs and potential “stagflation-lite” risks, prompting the Fed to hold off on rate cuts for now . Despite these inflationary pressures, US retail sales rebounded by 0.6 percent in June, driven by auto sales and preemptive consumer buying ahead of further tariff hikes, though real consumption gains remain marginal . Labour market data adds to the mixed picture—initial jobless claims are down, but continuing claims and slower wage growth suggest potential softening ahead. In crypto, institutional adoption surged as Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) became the first public company to hold over 600,000 BTC , now valued above $73 billion.

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of their latest, audacious move, signaling not just a significant Bitcoin investment but also a remarkable financial triumph. This isn’t just a ripple in the crypto pond; it’s a tidal wave that speaks volumes about institutional confidence in the digital asset space. Strategy, a leading Bitcoin investment company, recently made headlines with a massive acquisition. They announced on X (formerly Twitter) that they purchased an additional 6,220 BTC for approximately $739.8 million. This significant acquisition was made at an average price of roughly $118,940 per Bitcoin, showcasing a bold move in the market. What’s even more impressive is that this strategic purchase has contributed to an astounding year-to-date (YTD) Bitcoin yield of 20.8% for 2025. As of July 20, the firm now proudly holds a staggering 607,770 BTC, acquired for an estimated $43.61 billion at an average price of around $71,756 per BTC. This latest move reaffirms Strategy’s position as a dominant force in the institutional Bitcoin investment landscape. Decoding Strategy’s Latest Bitcoin Investment Move When a company like Strategy, known for its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy, makes such a substantial purchase, the market takes notice. The acquisition of 6,220 BTC for nearly $740 million at an average price north of $118,000 per coin highlights a profound conviction in Bitcoin’s future trajectory. While this price point might seem high to some, it aligns with Strategy’s long-term vision, demonstrating their belief that Bitcoin’s value will continue to appreciate significantly over time, making even current prices attractive for strategic accumulation. To put this latest Bitcoin investment into perspective, let’s look at how it integrates into their existing colossal holdings. Strategy has been systematically adding Bitcoin to its treasury for years, treating it as a primary reserve asset. This latest purchase is another testament to their ‘Bitcoin for corporate treasury’ playbook, which has proven remarkably successful. Bitcoin Investment: Strategy''s Spectacular 6,220 BTC Purchase Soars to 20.8% YTD Yield Metric Before Latest Purchase (Approx.) After Latest Purchase (As of July 20) Total BTC Holdings 601,550 BTC 607,770 BTC Total Acquired Cost $42.87 billion $43.61 billion Average Price per BTC $71,260 $71,756 This isn’t merely a transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver that underscores Strategy’s profound conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. They are not just buying Bitcoin; they are building a fortress of digital assets, setting a precedent for how corporations might manage their treasuries in an increasingly digital world. How Does This Bitcoin Investment Impact Strategy’s Portfolio? The impact of this latest acquisition on Strategy’s portfolio is substantial, not just in terms of sheer volume but also in demonstrating the effectiveness of their long-term accumulation strategy. With 607,770 BTC now under their belt, acquired at an average price of approximately $71,756, Strategy possesses one of the largest corporate holdings of Bitcoin globally. This scale provides them with significant leverage and exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements. However, the real headline-grabber is the reported 20.8% year-to-date (YTD) yield for 2025. Imagine achieving over a fifth of your initial investment back in profit within just seven months! This figure signifies that, despite the substantial recent purchase at a higher price, Strategy’s overall Bitcoin portfolio has appreciated considerably since the start of the year. This impressive yield is a powerful testament to Strategy’s shrewd capital allocation and the inherent volatility – and potential upside – of the Bitcoin market. It suggests that their earlier, lower-cost acquisitions are providing a significant buffer, allowing them to absorb higher-priced purchases while maintaining a strong overall profit margin. Key takeaways from Strategy’s portfolio performance include: Strategic Averaging: Despite buying at $118,940, their overall average acquisition cost remains much lower, showcasing the power of dollar-cost averaging over time for a large-scale Bitcoin investment . Conviction Over Short-Term Volatility: The consistent purchases, even during market fluctuations, highlight a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s fundamental value and its role as a long-term store of value. Leading Indicator: Strategy’s success with this approach serves as a potential blueprint for other corporations considering Bitcoin for their balance sheets. Their reported yield acts as a tangible performance metric that other treasurers might observe closely.

Solana DeFi TVL Hits $10.26B Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is booming, with total value locked (TVL) jumping to $10.26 billion, the highest in nearly six months. This surge is largely driven by SOL’s price rally. Leading the pack are Jito Sol ($3.09B), Jupiter Exchange ($2.90B), and Kamino Finance ($2.89B).

With more short sellers getting liquidated, the price is being pushed higher, possibly past $200 soon.

Looking at other altcoins, XRP saw an inflow of $36.1 million, Solana (SOL) $39.1 million, and Sui (SUI) $9.3 million.

2025-07-21 12:59:59+00:00,Can ADA Price Hit $12? Bullish Signals Mount,"The post Can ADA Price Hit $12? Bullish Signals Mount appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ADA price has most recently posted a remarkable 9% intraday gain, climbing to $0.90 and breaking past a significant resistance level at $0.85, which is the highest level since May 12. This resurgence reflects growing bullish momentum as Cardano price regains investor interest. The reclaiming of this level now marks a potential turning point in ADA crypto’s near-term structure. Technical Tailwinds: Golden Cross Patterns Forming Supporting this upward trend in ADA price are key technical indicators. A short-term golden cross formed early July between the 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (EMA). Now, the ADA price is nearing a more influential long-term golden cross, where the 50-day EMA is set to cross above the 200-day EMA. This setup is widely seen as a strong bullish continuation signal, and if confirmed, may drive further accumulation from traders and institutions alike. ETF Speculation and Market Sentiment Lift Outlook In addition to the charts, fundamental developments are fueling ADA crypto’s optimism. One of the major drivers is speculation around a potential spot ADA ETF approval by the SEC in 2025. With recent Proshares ultra XRP ETF approved, the altcoins approval odds have spiked, which includes ADA ETF too. Therefore, the rising traction pushes hopes to next level with Cardano next in line, if only the regulatory climate continues to shift in favor of altcoins. Adding to the sentiment is the anticipation of the Midnight airdrop , it is seen as influential move and expected to drive user engagement. That said, the broader belief that the crypto market rally is still having legs. Based on that, if Bitcoin price manages to sustain a new leg up, altcoins like ADA price could ride the wave. Analysts Weigh In: Targets from $1 to $12.86 While some investors are cautiously eyeing the $1 milestone, crypto analyst Ali Martinez believes $1 is no longer a question, but the beginning of a potential extended rally. Meanwhile, Dan Gambardello, a known Cardano supporter, presented a more ambitious case for ADA price. Bullish case. $Ada ETF approved, quantitative easing begins.

2025-07-21 13:00:30+00:00,Hold On For Dear Life: This Bullish Bitcoin Metric Just Touched A 15-Year High,"The percentage of Bitcoin’s long-term holders’ supply has reached a 15-year high, providing a bullish outlook for the flagship crypto. Asset manager Ark Invest highlighted this development in a recent report and explained what this could mean for BTC going forward. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Supply Hit 74% According to the Ark Invest report, the long-term holders’ supply has reached 74% of Bitcoin’s total supply, marking a 15-year high for this metric. The asset manager noted that this trend indicates growing market conviction in BTC’s role as a store of value or “digital gold.” These long-term holders refer to addresses that have held for 155 days or longer. Related Reading: Michael Saylor Reveals The Only Thing ‘Better Than Bitcoin’ As MSTR Stock Outperforms This development comes at a time when Bitcoin is witnessing massive demand from institutional investors through the ETFs and treasury companies. These investors are considered better ‘diamond-hands’ than retail investors, which means that this metric could keep rising, with long-term holders gaining more control of BTC’s total supply. This institutional buying has also driven the Bitcoin price to several all-time highs (ATHs) this year, with BTC reaching as high as $123,000 last week. The flagship crypto appears to still be in price discovery, as ETFs led by BlackRock and treasury companies, led by Saylor’s Strategy, continue to accumulate at an unprecedented pace. Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is ultra bullish on the Bitcoin price, predicting that it could reach $1.5 million by 2030. They expect BTC to reach this target due to the rising institutional investment and global recognition of Bitcoin’s ability to serve as a store of value. In a CNBC interview, Cathie Wood also doubled down on this prediction. She explained that they expect BTC to take a significant share from gold or grow the store of value market. Wood added that institutions are still just testing the waters despite the massive accumulation so far. As such, she still expects a rise in adoption for these companies. Meanwhile, only about 1 million unmined Bitcoins are remaining. Other Bullish Metrics For BTC The Ark Invest report also revealed that global liquidity per bitcoin reached a 12-year high. This metric reached this high with $5.7 million in global M2 supply per BTC in circulation. The asset manager remarked that this ratio could continue to rise given Bitcoin’s diminishing future supply growth and the continued expansion of global liquidity.

2025-07-21 13:00:30+00:00,Bitcoin Triumph: Profusa’s Landmark $100M Investment Signals a New Era for Corporate Treasuries,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Triumph: Profusa’s Landmark $100M Investment Signals a New Era for Corporate Treasuries In a move that is capturing the attention of both the financial world and the burgeoning digital asset space, Profusa, a Nasdaq-listed digital healthcare company (NASDAQ: PFSA), has announced a groundbreaking plan to invest a substantial sum of up to $100 million in Bitcoin. This bold Bitcoin investment is set to become a cornerstone of the company’s treasury strategy, marking a significant pivot for a publicly traded entity in the healthcare sector. What Does Profusa’s Bitcoin Investment Entail? Imagine a healthcare company, traditionally focused on medical innovation, making a strategic leap into the world of cryptocurrency. That’s precisely what Profusa is doing. According to a GlobeNewswire press release, the company has entered into a stock purchase agreement with Ascent Partners Fund, through which it plans to allocate a significant portion of its capital to the leading digital asset. Here’s a breakdown of Profusa’s audacious plan: Up to $100 Million Commitment: Profusa intends to invest a maximum of $100 million in Bitcoin. This is a substantial sum, reflecting a strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Primary Treasury Asset: The company will use all net proceeds above a $5 million cash reserve to acquire Bitcoin. This means Bitcoin isn’t just a side investment; it’s being positioned as Profusa’s primary treasury asset, a role traditionally held by fiat currencies, bonds, or other stable financial instruments. Imminent Purchases: Profusa expects to begin its initial Bitcoin purchases as early as this week, signaling a rapid execution of its new strategy. Quarterly Reporting: Transparency will be key, as the company plans to report its Bitcoin holdings quarterly, allowing investors and the market to track its digital asset portfolio. This decision by Profusa highlights a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations to explore alternative treasury management strategies, moving beyond conventional assets to embrace the potential of digital currencies. Why Are Companies Considering Bitcoin Investment for Their Treasuries? The question on many minds is, why Bitcoin? For years, corporate treasuries have relied on traditional assets like cash, short-term bonds, and money market funds to preserve capital and maintain liquidity. However, in an evolving economic landscape, these conventional approaches face new challenges. Several factors are driving companies to consider a Bitcoin investment : Inflation Hedge: With global inflation concerns on the rise, many companies are seeking assets that can preserve or even grow their purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its finite supply (capped at 21 million coins), is often viewed as a potential hedge against inflation, similar to digital gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury portfolio offers diversification away from traditional financial instruments, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk in the long term by not having all assets tied to a single economic system or currency. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin has historically shown significant price appreciation, attracting companies looking to generate returns on their idle cash reserves rather than seeing them erode due to inflation or low interest rates. Technological Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin aligns companies with the cutting edge of financial technology. It signals an understanding of the evolving digital economy and positions the company as innovative and forward-looking. Low Interest Rate Environment: In an era of near-zero or even negative interest rates, holding large cash reserves can be costly. Bitcoin offers an alternative with potential for yield, albeit with higher volatility. The Benefits and Risks of Corporate Bitcoin Investment While the allure of a Bitcoin investment is strong, it’s crucial to understand both the potential benefits and the inherent risks involved. Profusa’s move, while bold, comes with its own set of considerations. Potential Benefits: Capital Appreciation: As seen with early corporate adopters like MicroStrategy, significant gains can be realized if Bitcoin’s value continues to rise over time. Enhanced Shareholder Value: A successful Bitcoin strategy can potentially increase the company’s asset base and, consequently, shareholder value. Innovation Leadership: Being an early adopter in a new asset class can position a company as a leader and innovator within its industry and the broader market. Attracting New Investors: Companies embracing digital assets may appeal to a new segment of investors interested in the crypto space. Potential Risks: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is notoriously volatile. Its price can experience significant swings, which could impact the company’s balance sheet and quarterly earnings.

In a bold forecast on CNBC, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, has doubled down on his bullish Bitcoin stance. He predicts the leading cryptocurrency could reach $250,000 before the end of 2025. With Bitcoin currently trading at $118,760.61, up nearly 60% from $70,000, Lee believes the rally is far from over. What stands out is his reasoning. Even at $250,000, Bitcoin would represent only 25% of the gold market’s value, leaving significant room for growth. Is Bitcoin’s Big Leap Coming? Lee points out that Bitcoin is increasingly being viewed as a macro asset, similar to gold. This shift in perception is driving more capital into the market. “Even at $250,000, Bitcoin would only be valued at 25% of the gold market,” Lee said during the interview, highlighting how much potential Bitcoin still has. Institutional interest is rising steadily, and figures like Michael Saylor continue to make the case for Bitcoin as a long-term store of value . Combined with recent political support, Lee sees a strong case for significant upside this year. Long-Term Outlook: Bitcoin Over $1 Million? Lee is also thinking long term. He believes Bitcoin could eventually be worth more than $1 million per coin. The logic is simple. If Bitcoin truly becomes digital gold, its valuation should reflect that. “Digital gold means Bitcoin; should be worth over a million,” Lee said, pointing to the asset’s growing role as a hedge against inflation and currency risk. He also noted the influence of recent pro-crypto policies under President Trump . Bills like the Genius Act could further strengthen Bitcoin’s position and support the broader bull run. Crypto Twitter Reacts Lee’s forecast didn’t go unnoticed. Crypto Twitter was quick to respond with a mix of optimism, skepticism, and sharp analysis. One user on X wrote, “$250K sounds wild, until you zoom out and realize…” suggesting that while ambitious, the target may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. $250K sounds wild, until you zoom out and realize… it’s just one more leg in the pattern. — Mind Math Money (@MindMathMoney) July 21, 2025 This reaction reflects the mood of the broader crypto community, where bold predictions are often met with both excitement and healthy doubt. What’s Next for Bitcoin? As the crypto market expands and institutions continue to get involved, Lee’s predictions are sparking important conversations about Bitcoin’s future. If pro-crypto legislation continues to gain traction and adoption trends stay strong, the journey to $250,000 could become more realistic than many expect. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-21 13:05:23+00:00,Bitcoin Bonanza: Trump Media’s Bold $2 Billion Treasury Strategy Unveiled,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Bonanza: Trump Media’s Bold $2 Billion Treasury Strategy Unveiled Are you ready for a seismic shift in corporate finance? The world of digital assets just got another massive endorsement from an unexpected corner. Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. (Nasdaq: DJT) has made headlines with a stunning revelation: the company has amassed an astounding $2 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin -related securities as a core component of its treasury strategy. This isn’t just a minor allocation; it represents a significant two-thirds of its $3 billion in liquid assets, signaling a bold and decisive move into the future of finance. What does this mean for the company, the crypto market, and the broader corporate world? What’s Behind Trump Media’s Massive Bitcoin Bet? In a move that has sent ripples across financial markets, Trump Media and Technology Group Corp., known for its social media platform Truth Social, officially announced its substantial foray into the world of digital gold. According to a Globe Newswire press release, the company has strategically accumulated approximately $2 billion worth of Bitcoin and other assets closely tied to the cryptocurrency’s performance. This allocation is not just a speculative venture but a cornerstone of their meticulously planned Bitcoin treasury strategy. To put this into perspective, consider the scale: Total Liquid Assets: Trump Media holds $3 billion in liquid assets. Bitcoin Allocation: A staggering $2 billion, or roughly 66.7%, of these liquid assets, is now in Bitcoin and related instruments. Strategic Options: An additional $300 million has been earmarked for acquiring options in Bitcoin -related securities, with clear intentions to convert these into spot Bitcoin when market conditions are deemed favorable. This aggressive posture suggests a long-term conviction in Bitcoin ‘s role as a store of value and a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. It positions DJT not just as a tech company, but as a significant player in the evolving landscape of corporate digital asset management. Why Are Companies Embracing Bitcoin for Their Treasury? Trump Media’s decision isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. The question on many executives’ minds is: why hold traditional cash when you can potentially grow your reserves with a digital asset like Bitcoin ? Companies are increasingly looking beyond conventional treasury management to innovative strategies that protect and potentially enhance their capital. Here are some compelling reasons: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin ‘s fixed supply (21 million coins) offers a stark contrast to fiat currencies, whose supply can be expanded indefinitely. Many see it as a digital alternative to gold, a traditional inflation hedge. Store of Value: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience and long-term appreciation. For companies with excess cash reserves, holding Bitcoin can be a strategy to preserve purchasing power over time. Growth Potential: The digital asset market is still nascent, and many believe Bitcoin has substantial room for growth as adoption increases globally. Investing in Bitcoin can offer significant upside potential for corporate balance sheets. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury portfolio can provide diversification away from traditional assets like stocks, bonds, and fiat currency, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. However, it’s crucial to acknowledge the challenges. Bitcoin ‘s price volatility can be extreme, leading to significant fluctuations in a company’s balance sheet. Regulatory uncertainty also remains a concern, with governments worldwide still grappling with how to classify and oversee digital assets. Security risks, such as hacks and cyber theft, also demand robust internal controls and expertise. Trump Media joins a notable list of companies that have embraced Bitcoin for their treasury, including pioneers like MicroStrategy, which holds billions in Bitcoin , and tech giants such as Tesla, which previously made a significant purchase. These examples illustrate a growing conviction in Bitcoin ‘s long-term viability as a corporate asset. Understanding the Nuances of Bitcoin -Related Securities and Options Trump Media’s announcement specified holdings in both direct Bitcoin and “ Bitcoin -related securities,” alongside a substantial allocation for “options acquisition.” What exactly do these terms mean in the context of a corporate treasury strategy? Bitcoin -Related Securities: These are financial instruments whose value is directly tied to the price of Bitcoin , but they are not actual spot Bitcoin . They can include: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, which hold actual Bitcoin and allow investors to gain exposure without directly owning the cryptocurrency.

2025-07-21 13:07:13+00:00,The Ether Machine to list on Nasdaq in $1.6B SPAC deal with 400K ETH,"According to a Reuters report , a new Ethereum-based venture is preparing to enter the public market through a $1.6 billion merger with blank-check firm Dynamix Corporation (DYNX). Known as The Ether Reserve, the firm will relist under the name The Ether Machine and is expected to launch with more than 400,000 Ether (ETH) on its balance sheet—making it the largest publicly traded vehicle offering direct institutional exposure to Ethereum. The deal represents a significant moment for Ethereum in the context of public markets. While Bitcoin has been the primary crypto asset embraced by institutions, this SPAC transaction signals growing demand for Ethereum-backed equity offerings. The listing is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2025. Ether-backed equities gain traction amid regulatory clarity Ether has seen strong performance in recent weeks, with the price hitting a six-month high last Friday. Part of this momentum is attributed to increasing regulatory clarity in the US, particularly surrounding US dollar-pegged stablecoins. Many of these stablecoins operate on the Ethereum blockchain, reinforcing Ether’s foundational role in decentralised finance (DeFi) and stable asset issuance. This regulatory environment is enabling more crypto-native firms to explore equity markets as a route to raise capital. By bringing Ethereum directly onto the balance sheet and offering public exposure via shares, The Ether Machine aims to attract traditional investors who may be hesitant to engage directly with cryptocurrency wallets or decentralised exchanges. High-profile investors back Ethereum’s public market entry The Ether Machine’s SPAC merger has attracted contributions exceeding $800 million from a consortium of major crypto investors, including Blockchain.com, Kraken, and Pantera Capital. These funds were raised through an upsized common stock offering, boosting the total deal value to over $1.6 billion. Andrew Keys, former executive at Ethereum development studio ConsenSys, will serve as the chairman of The Ether Machine. Keys’ prior affiliation with Joseph Lubin, Ethereum’s co-founder, positions him as a strategic choice to steer this ambitious initiative. His appointment signals the venture’s intent to maintain deep alignment with the Ethereum ecosystem. The company will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ETHM” once the transaction is finalised. Ether Machine mirrors Bitcoin strategy popularised by Saylor The Ether Machine is following a precedent set by firms like Strategy (previously known as MicroStrategy), which used corporate reserves to acquire Bitcoin and integrate it into its balance sheet. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership, Strategy became a case study in crypto accumulation as a corporate treasury strategy. This model is now being adapted for Ether, marking a potential shift in the digital asset hierarchy for public companies. The inclusion of 400,000 ETH—currently worth over $1.2 billion (£930 million) at market prices—positions The Ether Machine at the centre of this evolution. It will hold more ETH than any other public firm to date. While the majority of recent institutional listings have prioritised Bitcoin exposure, the Ether Machine’s focus on Ethereum reflects the blockchain’s diverse use cases, ranging from smart contracts and decentralised applications to stablecoin settlements. ETH price rise fuels momentum as launch nears Dynamix Corporation’s shares more than doubled in premarket trading following the deal’s announcement, underlining investor enthusiasm for the listing. The Ether Machine is expected to benefit from Ethereum’s current market strength and broader industry developments such as anticipated Ethereum ETF approvals and renewed interest in DeFi protocols. The SPAC route offers a faster way to public markets compared to traditional IPOs. With the fourth-quarter target in sight, all eyes are now on the Ether Machine’s final balance sheet composition, Ethereum’s market valuation, and the timeline for its listing on Nasdaq under “ETHM.” The Ethereum ecosystem has largely welcomed the move, seeing it as a pivotal step in closing the gap between crypto-native innovation and traditional market infrastructure.

Andrew Keys, former executive at Ethereum development studio ConsenSys, will serve as the chairman of The Ether Machine. Keys’ prior affiliation with Joseph Lubin, Ethereum’s co-founder, positions him as a strategic choice to steer this ambitious initiative. His appointment signals the venture’s intent to maintain deep alignment with the Ethereum ecosystem. The company will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “ETHM” once the transaction is finalised. Ether Machine mirrors Bitcoin strategy popularised by Saylor The Ether Machine is following a precedent set by firms like Strategy (previously known as MicroStrategy), which used corporate reserves to acquire Bitcoin and integrate it into its balance sheet. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership, Strategy became a case study in crypto accumulation as a corporate treasury strategy. This model is now being adapted for Ether, marking a potential shift in the digital asset hierarchy for public companies. The inclusion of 400,000 ETH—currently worth over $1.2 billion (£930 million) at market prices—positions The Ether Machine at the centre of this evolution. It will hold more ETH than any other public firm to date. While the majority of recent institutional listings have prioritised Bitcoin exposure, the Ether Machine’s focus on Ethereum reflects the blockchain’s diverse use cases, ranging from smart contracts and decentralised applications to stablecoin settlements. ETH price rise fuels momentum as launch nears Dynamix Corporation’s shares more than doubled in premarket trading following the deal’s announcement, underlining investor enthusiasm for the listing. The Ether Machine is expected to benefit from Ethereum’s current market strength and broader industry developments such as anticipated Ethereum ETF approvals and renewed interest in DeFi protocols. The SPAC route offers a faster way to public markets compared to traditional IPOs. With the fourth-quarter target in sight, all eyes are now on the Ether Machine’s final balance sheet composition, Ethereum’s market valuation, and the timeline for its listing on Nasdaq under “ETHM.” The Ethereum ecosystem has largely welcomed the move, seeing it as a pivotal step in closing the gap between crypto-native innovation and traditional market infrastructure.

JUST IN: Trump Media buys $2 billion worth of Bitcoin for its treasury. pic.twitter.com/lbPcdoe1od — Watcher.Guru (@WatcherGuru) July 21, 2025 The company disclosed that these holdings now make up around two-thirds of its $3 billion in liquid assets, showing its commitment to crypto as a primary financial instrument. In addition to direct holdings, Trump Media said it has deployed $300 million in capital toward acquiring options tied to bitcoin-related securities. The company plans to convert these options into spot bitcoin, depending on market conditions, and to use the assets to support revenue generation and potential further acquisitions. This approach indicates that Trump Media is not simply holding bitcoin as a store of value but is building a broader crypto strategy aimed at integrating digital assets into its operations and future expansion. CEO Devin Nunes: “Executing Our Bitcoin Treasury Plan” Trump Media’s CEO and President, Devin Nunes, reaffirmed the company’s direction and purpose behind its bitcoin strategy: “We’re rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan. These assets help ensure our Company’s financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we’re planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere.” The company envisions these crypto reserves as a tool for autonomy, resilience, and product innovation. Trump Media has previously stated its intention to launch a utility token to support functionality across its platforms, suggesting that its crypto treasury may play a foundational role in that effort. Trump Administration Shows Broader Crypto Support The update comes during a pivotal period for digital asset policy in the United States. On Friday, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, following its dramatic rescue in Congress. The new law establishes clearer regulatory frameworks for dollar-backed stablecoins and signals a broader government push toward digital asset innovation and oversight. With $2 billion already allocated to bitcoin and additional crypto infrastructure underway, Trump Media is positioning itself as a leading corporate entity in the evolving digital finance landscape. Bitcoin’s Minor Pullback from $123K ATH Bitcoin experienced a potential deeper pullback during Asia trading hours on Monday, after consolidating near $117,000. The crypto is currently just below last week’s all-time high of $123,000 and is retracing, trading just above $118,263 at the time of writing. Bitcoin has displayed a bullish pennant pattern following a strong vertical rally to $123K. A pennant or a flag formation in July indicates the impending continuation of a strong upward price movement.

2025-07-21 13:14:41+00:00,Strategy’s $71B BTC Bet Puts It Near S&P500 — What It Means for Bitcoin Hyper,"Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) just pulled off a flex that few saw coming—it’s officially leapfrogged tech titan Nvidia in corporate treasury value, and it’s all thanks to one thing: a relentless $BTC buying spree. With over $71B worth of Bitcoin on the books and $MSTR stock rocketing over 3,500% in just five years, Strategy’s bet is paying off big time. Now, with those numbers doing the talking, the company’s eyeing a potential seat at the S&P 500 table. And as institutional interest in $BTC grows, the need for faster, more scalable, and cost-effective transactions also increases. Thankfully, this is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes into play, a Layer 2 solution designed to address the Bitcoin network’s most common pain points. Strategy’s Stock Ranks #9 Among S&P 500 Firms Strategy’s crypto holdings now exceed 600K $BTC, up by 65.41% all-time, which represents a whopping ~$28B gain . Purely owing to its sizable $BTC holdings, the company now ranks #9 among all S&P 500 firms by treasury size, outpacing bigwigs like Exxon, NVIDIA, PayPal, and CVS. Just since the start of this year, Strategy has scooped up over 88,000 $BTC—yeah, in a matter of months. And they’re not buying at the top either. They’ve been striking during market dips, stacking sats at discount prices to boost long-term gains. It’s a calculated move to tighten their grip on the Bitcoin game and reinforce their position as one of the most aggressive corporate hodlers in the space. Strategy’s bold $BTC accumulation has paid off, delivering a 135%+ return over the past year and pushing its stock price from under $180 to over $423. If Strategy officially enters the S&P 500, it could unlock a wave of institutional capital chasing indirect Bitcoin exposure, particularly from funds previously restricted from buying $BTC. But with increased attention comes increased network activity, fees, and congestion on Bitcoin’s base layer. This is where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) steps in as a critical scaling solution. Bitcoin Hyper to Address Bitcoin’s Woes in Q3 2025 Bitcoin Hyper is an upcoming Bitcoin Layer 2 solution. Once launched in Q3 2025, it aims to address the network’s long-standing challenges – namely, slow transaction speeds, high fees, and limited smart contract capabilities. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , it’ll allow developers to bring high-performance dApps to Bitcoin that were previously only possible on the Ethereum network. Another notable feature is its Canonical Bridge . It’ll allow you to move $BTC from the Layer 1 and Layer 2. By doing so, Bitcoin Hyper should enable $BTC transactions to be faster and cheaper while maintaining true decentralization. As excitement builds, investors are turning to the project’s native token, $HYPER, as evidenced by it already raising over $3.9M on presale. Whale buyers are showing keen interest in $HYPER, with three of them investing $74.9K , $54.1K , and $53.9K in the project. Their interest is likely driven not just by the L2’s developments but also to save on gas fees, secure governance rights, and earn staking rewards (currently at a 241% APY) – all of which acquiring $HYPER grants. Purchase $HYPER for Possible 2,400% Gains Strategy’s significant $BTC acquisitions signal a new era in institutional crypto adoption. But as Bitcoin scales, its network needs help, which is where Bitcoin Hyper shines. To maximize the benefits of the upcoming Layer 2, you can purchase $HYPER on presale for just $0.01235. If you join today, you’ll open yourself to possible returns exceeding 2,400%. This is because $HYPER is anticipated to surge to $0.32 this year, following the mainnet launch and being listed on the best crypto exchanges . This isn’t investment advice.

2025-07-21 13:15:42+00:00,"The signals markets are watching this week: Data updates, earnings reports, money policy","Wall Street is smashing record highs, and markets are ignoring tariff noise from the Trump administration. Amid this boom, the upcoming week is quietly loaded with catalysts that could reset investor expectations. However, the digital assets market is still printing green indexes as altcoin season takes over after Bitcoin rally. As the markets zoom into a critical week, US stock futures rose on Monday. S&P 500 futures and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures both surged by almost 0.3%. Stocks are expected to continue their last week’s rally. The cumulative crypto market cap surged by 2% to hover around $4 trillion mark. Powell’s speech and earnings Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s upcoming speech in Washington on Tuesday will grab all the ears of global investors. He is expected to touch on inflation trends, labor market resilience, and the most crucial interest rates. This comes in after last week’s rumors that Trump wants to fire him . The news triggered a short-lived “Sell America” moment before Trump walked it back. Tuesday will also see earnings reports from Coca-Cola (KO), Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Motors (GM), SAP (SAP), Texas Instruments (TXN), Capital One (COF), DR Horton (DHI), Enphase Energy (ENPH) and Philip Morris (PM). Fed Vice Chair Michelle Bowman speaking on Wednesday could also add to the narrative at the same event. Her hawkish stance could clash with Fed Governor Waller, who just called for a rate cut in July, warning that waiting for job market pain is a mistake. Meanwhile, markets didn’t believe it as rate cut odds for July remained at 5%, down from 13% a month ago. Source: CME FedWatch The inflation data added some fresh complexity to the macro picture. CPI rose by 2.7% year-over-year, beating the forecast of 2.6%. It was up from May’s 2.4%. Core inflation came in softer, but price rises in tariff-sensitive sectors like toys, furniture, and clothing are putting pressure on the Fed. If Trump follows through with his August 1 tariffs, inflation could heat up again, forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. This is exactly what Trump doesn’t want. Against this backdrop, corporate earnings will take center stage on Wednesday. Over 110 S&P 500 companies are reporting results this week. It includes some of the most closely watched names in the tech arena. Alphabet, Tesla , and Chipotle are all on deck. Europe waits while crypto runs In Europe, the focus will be on the ECB’s rate decision on July 23–24. Analysts think they’ll keep rates steady at 3.75%, watching the data roll in before making any big moves. This comes in when the eurozone remains sticky. Thursday will come with Initial Jobless Claims, which stood at 221,000 for the week ending July 12. It is expected to increase up to 229,000 for the week ending July 19. Investors are eagerly waiting for Chicago Fed Activity Index and S&P Global PMIs for Manufacturing, Services, and Composite, too. As the Fed enters its pre-meeting blackout period and earnings pour in, this week may ultimately be defined by how investors see growth ahead. Meanwhile, the crypto market is enjoying this run. Bitcoin recorded a new ATH of above $123K while Ethereum is up by 24% over the past 7 days.

Her hawkish stance could clash with Fed Governor Waller, who just called for a rate cut in July, warning that waiting for job market pain is a mistake. Meanwhile, markets didn’t believe it as rate cut odds for July remained at 5%, down from 13% a month ago. Source: CME FedWatch The inflation data added some fresh complexity to the macro picture. CPI rose by 2.7% year-over-year, beating the forecast of 2.6%. It was up from May’s 2.4%. Core inflation came in softer, but price rises in tariff-sensitive sectors like toys, furniture, and clothing are putting pressure on the Fed. If Trump follows through with his August 1 tariffs, inflation could heat up again, forcing the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. This is exactly what Trump doesn’t want. Against this backdrop, corporate earnings will take center stage on Wednesday. Over 110 S&P 500 companies are reporting results this week. It includes some of the most closely watched names in the tech arena. Alphabet, Tesla , and Chipotle are all on deck. Europe waits while crypto runs In Europe, the focus will be on the ECB’s rate decision on July 23–24. Analysts think they’ll keep rates steady at 3.75%, watching the data roll in before making any big moves. This comes in when the eurozone remains sticky. Thursday will come with Initial Jobless Claims, which stood at 221,000 for the week ending July 12. It is expected to increase up to 229,000 for the week ending July 19. Investors are eagerly waiting for Chicago Fed Activity Index and S&P Global PMIs for Manufacturing, Services, and Composite, too. As the Fed enters its pre-meeting blackout period and earnings pour in, this week may ultimately be defined by how investors see growth ahead. Meanwhile, the crypto market is enjoying this run. Bitcoin recorded a new ATH of above $123K while Ethereum is up by 24% over the past 7 days. KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast"

2025-07-21 13:25:24+00:00,India Crypto Regulations: A Landmark Proposal for Digital Asset Freedom,"BitcoinWorld India Crypto Regulations: A Landmark Proposal for Digital Asset Freedom The world of cryptocurrencies and Web3 is constantly evolving, and nowhere is this more evident than in India. For years, stakeholders have clamored for clarity and a progressive framework for digital assets. The lack of comprehensive India crypto regulations has left innovators and investors navigating uncertainty. But a potential solution has emerged: the COINS Act – a model law designed to unlock India’s immense potential in the digital economy. What is the COINS Act and Why is it Crucial for India Crypto Regulations? In a significant development for India’s burgeoning Web3 ecosystem, Web3 investment firm Hashed Emergent and policy advisory group Black Dot have unveiled the COINS Act (Crypto-Asset, Innovation, and National Security Act). This isn’t just another discussion paper; it’s a meticulously crafted model law, aiming to provide much-needed clarity and a forward-thinking framework for India crypto regulations . Think of it as a blueprint, designed to address existing ambiguities and foster an environment ripe for innovation. The COINS Act is a non-binding proposal, meaning it’s not yet law, but its significance lies in its potential to influence future legislative discussions. It represents a collaborative effort to articulate a vision for how India can embrace the digital asset revolution responsibly and strategically. Its core objective is to transform India into a more attractive hub for crypto builders, developers, and users by laying down clear, consistent, and supportive rules. Currently, the regulatory environment in India is characterized by a piecemeal approach, often leading to confusion and hindering growth. The COINS Act seeks to replace this ambiguity with a comprehensive framework. Here’s a brief comparison: Aspect Current Scenario (Broad Strokes) COINS Act Proposal Regulatory Clarity Fragmented, often reactive, lack of a single overarching framework. Proposes a dedicated crypto regulator for cohesive oversight. Taxation High, often seen as prohibitive (e.g., 30% tax on gains, 1% TDS). Aims to address high taxes, potentially suggesting more favorable structures. User Rights & Protections Limited explicit protections for crypto users and their assets. Outlines specific rights like self-custody and financial privacy. Innovation & Growth Hindered by uncertainty, leading to talent drain and slower adoption. Seeks to foster innovation by providing a predictable legal environment. Asset Oversight No clear mechanism for managing seized crypto assets. Recommends a national Bitcoin reserve seeded from seized assets. What Revolutionary Rights and Freedoms Does COINS Act Propose for Digital Assets? One of the most compelling aspects of the COINS Act is its focus on enshrining fundamental rights for crypto users and participants. These proposed rights are crucial for building trust, encouraging adoption, and ensuring that individuals have control over their digital assets. For the evolution of sound India crypto regulations , these are game-changers: Self-Custody: This is a cornerstone of true decentralization. The COINS Act recognizes the right of individuals to hold their own private keys and manage their digital assets without relying on third-party intermediaries. This empowers users and aligns with blockchain’s core ethos. Protocol Access: The proposal advocates for the right to access and utilize open blockchain protocols. This means fostering an environment where developers can build, and users can interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and various blockchain networks without undue restrictions. It ensures an open internet for finance and innovation. Financial Privacy: While balancing the need for anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, the COINS Act seeks to protect the financial privacy of individuals using digital assets. This is vital for personal autonomy, ensuring legitimate transactions are not unduly scrutinized. By outlining these explicit rights, the COINS Act aims to provide a robust legal foundation that can protect users and encourage responsible innovation. It signals a move towards treating digital assets with the respect and understanding they deserve, rather than viewing them solely through a lens of suspicion. How Does COINS Act Tackle Existing Challenges in India Crypto Regulations? The current landscape of India crypto regulations is plagued by several pain points that have stifled growth and pushed talent overseas. The COINS Act directly addresses these critical issues, offering pragmatic solutions: High Taxation: India’s current tax regime for crypto, including a flat 30% tax on gains and a 1% Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) on transactions, has been widely criticized for being punitive and discouraging. The COINS Act aims to propose a more rational and progressive tax structure that incentivizes participation rather than penalizing it.

This move marks the company’s first crypto asset purchase and signals its intention to incorporate decentralized assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana into its broader financial management framework. Crypto Allocation Approved by Board The company said its board of directors has approved a strategy that allows for up to 80% of its treasury holdings to be allocated to crypto assets. The digital holdings will be custodied by a regulated, institutional-grade provider, in full compliance with legal and industry standards regarding security, custody, and reporting. As part of a more diversified reserve strategy, crypto assets are being evaluated for their long-term store of value potential and ability to act as a hedge against systemic risks in traditional financial markets. CEO: Bitcoin Offers Long-Term Resilience In a statement, Matthew Priebe, CEO of NextGen, described the initiative as both forward-looking and rooted in financial caution. “We believe Bitcoin is a unique monetary asset that offers long-term resilience and upside as a treasury reserve. Our decision to allocate capital into Bitcoin reflects our confidence in the long-term value and relevance of decentralized assets in the global economy.” The company explains that its current development plans and operations will not be affected by this shift. Any future material acquisitions of digital assets will be disclosed as required under applicable regulations. Aligning with a Global Trend NextGen joins a growing list of publicly traded companies allocating part of their balance sheet into crypto, amid rising institutional interest in decentralized finance. The company views this move as a way to improve the diversification and robustness of its treasury, especially in light of fiscal volatility and inflationary challenges worldwide. Through this initiative, NextGen aims to align with global trends in digital asset adoption while maintaining its commitment to regulatory compliance, transparency, and long-term shareholder value. The company also operates PCSections.com, an e-commerce platform, and Cloud AI Hosting, a hardware-as-a-service solution tailored for the AI industry, giving it a diversified presence in both emerging technology and decentralized finance. Corporate Treasuries Follow Saylor’s Lead An increasing number of firms are taking a leaf out of Michael Saylor’s Strategy playbook, following the lead of his aggressive bitcoin treasury strategy that began in 2020. Saylor’s approach—allocating large portions of corporate reserves into bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement—has shifted the conversation around digital assets from speculative trading to long-term balance sheet management.

2025-07-21 13:40:46+00:00,Here’s why Trump Media stock price is soaring today,"Trump Media (NASDAQ: DJT ) surged at the opening bell on Monday after announcing that its Bitcoin treasury program has swelled to approximately $2 billion in combined holdings of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities. The company, which operates Truth Social, revealed in a press release that the crypto-heavy strategy now accounts for roughly two-thirds of its $3 billion in liquid assets. In addition to direct Bitcoin exposure, Trump Media has allocated $300 million for purchasing options tied to Bitcoin-linked equities, which it may eventually convert into spot Bitcoin depending on market conditions. DJT shares rose 8.73% pre-market, jumping from Friday’s close of $18.67 to $20.30 on the news. The market reaction reflects growing investor confidence in the company’s aggressive move into digital assets, which aligns closely with President Trump’s broader push for the United States to become a global crypto leader.

The metric that tracks the percentage of the total crypto market cap held by BTC has fallen by 5.8% in just one week, now resting at 59.25%, the biggest drop since June 2022. According to TradingView, the dominance rate peaked at nearly 66% by the end of June but has since retreated from 63% to below 60% in the last seven days. The decline coincides with a rise in the total market cap of altcoins, which has now reached $1.5 trillion, the highest level since late January 2025. Bitcoin’s price has dipped by 3.7% from its all-time high of $122,838, reached on July 14. As of the time of this publication, BTC was trading around $118,079, per Coingecko data. Altcoin market performance teases season start Capital inflows into altcoins have been on the uptrend since mid-July, which could mean that investors now favor smaller-cap assets over Bitcoin, possibly because the highest ranking coin by market cap reached an all-time high just seven days ago. Ethereum’s (ETH) 25% charge into the green zone has pulled up several altcoins into gains and helped some of them reach multi-month highs. Some analysts believe that if this momentum continues, the altcoin season could begin as early as August. Altcoin season is confirmed when 75% of the top 50 cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and asset-backed tokens, outperform Bitcoin over a 90-day period. Only 50% of alts have recorded better gains than BTC in the last 3 months, but more coins could be beating the crypto “gold standard” in the coming weeks. In an X post on Sunday, Podcaster Michael van de Poppe asserted that the altcoin bull market has already begun. “The Bitcoin dominance has a strong bearish divergence confirmed, as it broke south of 65%. The second half of the year is the best period of the year for altcoins, which means that this is the time to maximize your returns,” he noted. BTC Dominance chart. Source: TradingView Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) was among today’s biggest altcoin gainers with 25% in the last 24 hours. The TRUMP token, a memecoin associated with President Donald Trump, also gained 11.4% over the same period. Most tokens in the top ten bar stablecoins are charting daily gains between 1.5% and 10%. Correlation between BTC and altcoins is weak Data from the Correlation Heatmap, shared by Alphractal in a Telegram group, shows that the average correlation between altcoins and BTC has turned negative in some cases. “In other words, altcoins are no longer following Bitcoin’s movements,” Alphractal said. “Historically, low correlation is a red flag. It often precedes periods of high volatility and mass liquidations—whether from shorts or longs.” This divergence could mean that while Bitcoin’s price is cooling off, other coins behave independently to tread on more volatile ground in either direction in the market.

2025-07-21 13:50:23+00:00,Bitcoin Whale Move: Monumental $70.8 Million Transfer to Coinbase Institutional Signals Shifting Tides,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Move: Monumental $70.8 Million Transfer to Coinbase Institutional Signals Shifting Tides The cryptocurrency world is abuzz once again as a significant transaction has captured the attention of market observers: a massive Bitcoin whale move . Recently, Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a substantial transfer of 599 BTC, valued at approximately $70.8 million, from an unknown wallet directly to Coinbase Institutional. This colossal movement of digital assets immediately raises questions and stirs discussions across the crypto community. What does such a large Bitcoin whale move signify for the market? Is it a precursor to a major market shift, or simply a strategic repositioning by a deep-pocketed investor? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this intriguing development. What Just Happened with This Bitcoin Whale Move? On a day that seemed ordinary, the digital airwaves lit up with news of a colossal Bitcoin whale move . According to the widely followed blockchain tracker Whale Alert on X (formerly Twitter), a staggering 599 Bitcoins, equating to roughly $70.8 million at the time of the transfer, were relocated. The journey began from a wallet categorized as ‘unknown’ – a common designation for addresses not publicly associated with known exchanges or entities – and concluded its journey at Coinbase Institutional. This isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a meticulously executed transfer involving a significant portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, pointing towards a calculated decision by a powerful market participant. The precision and destination of this Bitcoin whale move are particularly noteworthy. Coinbase Institutional is not merely a retail exchange; it’s a dedicated platform designed for large-scale institutional investors, hedge funds, and corporations. This choice of destination suggests a sophisticated strategy, potentially involving asset management, large-volume trading, or secure custody for long-term holding. Understanding the nuances of this transfer is key to deciphering its potential impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. Unpacking the Mystery: Who Are These Bitcoin Whales? The term ‘whale’ in the cryptocurrency lexicon refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to influence market prices with their trades. In the context of Bitcoin, a whale typically holds thousands of BTC. Their movements, especially a significant Bitcoin whale move like the one we’re discussing, are closely watched because they can often precede notable price fluctuations or indicate broader market sentiment among the largest holders. These whales can be: Early Adopters: Individuals who mined or bought Bitcoin in its nascent stages when prices were exceptionally low. Institutional Investors: Large financial firms, hedge funds, or corporations that have accumulated Bitcoin as part of their investment portfolios. Founding Entities/Creators: In some cases, the creators of a cryptocurrency or related projects might hold significant reserves. Exchanges or Custodians: While this particular move was to an institutional arm of an exchange, exchanges themselves hold vast amounts of crypto on behalf of their users. The power of a Bitcoin whale move lies in its potential to create ripple effects. A large sell-off could trigger a price drop, while a significant accumulation could signal bullish sentiment and drive prices up. Therefore, monitoring these large transactions offers a glimpse into the intentions of the market’s biggest players. Why Coinbase Institutional for Such a Significant Bitcoin Whale Move? The choice of Coinbase Institutional as the destination for this massive Bitcoin whale move is highly telling. Coinbase Institutional is not just another trading platform; it represents a specialized suite of services tailored for sophisticated institutional investors. Its features go far beyond what typical retail exchanges offer, focusing on security, compliance, and robust trading infrastructure designed to handle immense volumes. Key reasons why a whale might opt for Coinbase Institutional include: Enhanced Security and Custody: Institutional platforms provide advanced security measures, including multi-signature wallets, cold storage solutions, and comprehensive insurance policies, which are crucial for safeguarding tens of millions of dollars in digital assets. Regulatory Compliance: Coinbase is a regulated entity in the United States, offering a level of trust and compliance that is paramount for large financial institutions operating under strict regulatory frameworks. This minimizes legal and operational risks. Deep Liquidity and OTC Desks: For a Bitcoin whale move of this magnitude, executing trades on open markets could cause significant slippage and impact prices.

Now trading at around $3,800, Ethereum crypto has registered a 30% gain over the past week, jumping from $2,900. This rise is fueling investor enthusiasm around the altcoin’s growing institutional presence and improving regulatory environment. ETF Inflows Power Ethereum’s Institutional Momentum One of the most prominent factors behind the ETH price surge in entire July is the massive influx witnessed into U.S.-based spot Ethereum ETFs. These institutional products saw record-setting activity in mid-July. On July 16 alone, net inflows hit a historic $727 million, which is the highest in July. Where BlackRock’s ETHA fund on the very same day accounted for the majority of this inflow, drawing $499.2 million in a single day. Such numbers reflect a rapid maturation of Ethereum as a credible long-term investment vehicle for asset managers and large institutions. That said, this trend is mirroring how the earlier trajectory of Bitcoin ETFs grew parabolically, which transformed BTC into a widely held institutional asset. It seems now, it’s time for ETH to shine, and many experts suggest ETH appears to be following a similar path to BTC, potentially laying the groundwork for more stable and prolonged upside movements in its valuation. Legislative Tailwinds and Technical Patterns Strengthen Bull Case While ETH ETF inflows dominate headlines, recent legislative developments have also contributed to positive sentiment around Ethereum. Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed three major crypto bills, including the GENIUS Act. This bill aims to strongly allow the US to become a crypto hub by establishing a clear federal framework for stablecoins, enhancing regulatory clarity across the sector. These moves play their central role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and stablecoin infrastructure. As regulatory fog lifts, its ecosystem could see an uptick in institutional participation and user growth. From a technical standpoint, Ethereum crypto’s monthly chart appears to be breaking out of a multi-year symmetrical triangle. The $ETH chart looks nuclear. Triple RSI bounce. Compression building. Macro channel fully intact. When this blows, $5K won’t be the end it’ll be the beginning. It’s rewriting the narrative. pic.twitter.com/G5l6lqCHHE — Merlijn The Trader (@MerlijnTrader) July 21, 2025 According to analyst Merlijn The Trader, the ETH price structure is showing “nuclear” strength, citing a triple RSI bounce and compression signals within a clearly defined macro channel. If the breakout confirms, the next phase could begin with a $5,000 move and eventually target a much larger price discovery phase, potentially reaching $17,000.

For those of us keenly observing the cryptocurrency landscape, the performance of traditional markets often serves as a crucial barometer. While crypto assets chart their own course, they are not entirely insulated from the broader economic currents that propel or constrain the U.S. stock markets . Understanding these movements is key to navigating the interconnected financial ecosystem. What Sparked Today’s Positive Open in U.S. Stock Markets? The trading day commenced with a palpable sense of optimism as the major indices registered immediate gains. This positive momentum in the U.S. stock markets is a welcome sight for investors, signaling robust confidence in the economy’s near-term trajectory. Here’s a snapshot of the opening performance: Index Opening Performance S&P500 +0.22% NASDAQ Composite +0.05% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.20% These initial gains, though seemingly modest, reflect underlying positive sentiment. The S&P500, a broad indicator of large-cap U.S. equities, edged up, suggesting a widespread positive outlook across various sectors. The NASDAQ Composite, heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, also showed green, indicating continued investor interest in innovation-driven companies. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 significant U.S. companies, contributed to the overall bullish start, reinforcing the idea of a healthy economic foundation. This synchronized upward movement across the leading U.S. stock markets indices paints a picture of a market eager to climb. How Do U.S. Stock Markets Influence the Crypto Realm? It might seem like two separate universes, but the truth is, the traditional U.S. stock markets and the burgeoning cryptocurrency space often move in surprising tandem. Why does a good day for the S&P500 matter to your Bitcoin holdings? Here are a few key connections: Investor Sentiment: When traditional markets are buoyant, overall investor confidence tends to be high. This positive sentiment can spill over into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Investors might feel more comfortable allocating capital to digital assets when their conventional portfolios are performing well. Liquidity Flows: A strong stock market can free up capital. If investors are seeing good returns in equities, they might take some profits or feel more confident in diversifying into crypto, increasing liquidity in the digital asset space. Conversely, a downturn in stocks can lead to a flight to safety, pulling funds out of crypto. Macroeconomic Indicators: The same economic data points that drive the U.S. stock markets – inflation reports, interest rate decisions, employment figures – also impact crypto. For instance, concerns about rising inflation might make Bitcoin more attractive as a hedge, or conversely, aggressive rate hikes could dampen enthusiasm for all speculative assets. Institutional Adoption: Many institutional investors, who increasingly hold both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies, often view their portfolios holistically. Their allocation decisions can be influenced by the performance and outlook of the broader stock market, directly impacting institutional flows into crypto. Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for any investor looking to build a resilient portfolio across different asset classes. The health of the U.S. stock markets is a significant piece of the puzzle. What Are the Key Drivers Behind This U.S. Stock Markets Surge? A positive market opening rarely happens in a vacuum. Several factors contribute to investor optimism and the upward trajectory of the U.S. stock markets . Pinpointing these drivers helps us understand the broader economic narrative: Strong Corporate Earnings: Many companies have recently reported earnings that either met or exceeded expectations. Robust corporate performance is a direct indicator of economic health and boosts investor confidence, as it suggests strong underlying business fundamentals. Favorable Economic Data: Recent economic indicators, such as positive employment figures or better-than-expected manufacturing data, can signal a resilient economy. Such data often reassures investors that a recession might be avoided or that a “soft landing” is achievable, thereby supporting the U.S. stock markets . Inflationary Trends: Signs that inflation is cooling, or at least moderating, can be a significant catalyst. Lower inflation could lead central banks to ease their aggressive monetary tightening policies, which typically bodes well for equity valuations.

According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Monday, the latest purchase was completed during the week ending July 20, at an average price of $118,940 per coin. The acquisition cost a total of approximately $739.8 million and was made in the week when Bitcoin’s price briefly touched $122,800 before retreating to an intraweek low near $116,000, eventually stabilizing around $118,000, according to CoinGecko data. US firms, Strategy and Trump Media, stack up more BTC Strategy now holds 607,770 Bitcoins after its latest purchase, valued at approximately $72 billion based on current prices. The company’s total acquisition cost is $43.6 billion, with an average purchase price of $71,756 per coin. It also reported that its year-to-date (YTD) Bitcoin yield rose from 20.2% to 20.8%, much closer to its internal target of 25%. Another US firm Trump Media and Technology Group Corp. ( TMTG ), the company behind Truth Social, streaming service Truth+, and financial technology platform Truth.Fi, announced today that it had accumulated roughly $2 billion in Bitcoin and related securities. The investments account for about two-thirds of its $3 billion in liquid assets. The firm also revealed that an additional $300 million has been committed to an options acquisition strategy for Bitcoin-related securities. In its press statement, Trump Media mentioned that it may convert these options into spot Bitcoin holdings, pending the state of the market and the asset’s price. “ We’re rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan ,” CEO Devin Nunes stated. “ These assets help ensure our company’s financial freedom and will create synergies with the utility token we’re planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere .” French companies add more coins to Bitcoin treasuries Sequans Communications S.A. a French-based cellular IoT and semiconductor company, also disclosed a fresh addition to its Bitcoin holdings. The company acquired 1,264 Bitcoins for approximately $150 million at an average cost of $118,659 per coin, including transaction fees. As of July 18, Sequans’ total Bitcoin holdings stood at 2,317 BTC, acquired at a cumulative cost of $270 million. The average purchase price for its entire reserve is $116,493 per Bitcoin. Another firm in France, Paris-based The Blockchain Group, acquired 22 Bitcoins for around €2.2 million ($2.5 million), pushing its total reserves to 1,955 BTC, valued at approximately €177 million ($206 million). The company said the acquisition followed the completion of a capital increase program in collaboration with French asset manager TOBAM. The program raised about €1.1 million through the issuance of new shares at €3.95 per share. These proceeds were used to purchase 10 BTC. Moreover, the conversion of BSA 2025-01 warrants into 2,274,754 ordinary shares financed the acquisition of 12 more Bitcoins. According to company disclosures, The Blockchain Group has realized a year-to-date BTC yield of 1,373.2%, resulting in gains of 549.3 BTC and €55.5 million. Profusa launches Bitcoin treasury program In other news, biomedicine and digital health company Profusa, Inc. will be launching a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Ascent Partners Fund LLC, in which the latter will purchase up to $100 million of Profusa’s common stock under an equity line of credit (ELOC). All net proceeds from the ELOC, provided Profusa keeps a cash balance above $5 million at the time of transaction, will be used to acquire Bitcoin. Should the company’s balance fall below that threshold, the proceeds will first be used to replenish reserves before any Bitcoin purchases are made. The shares will be sold at a price equal to 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over the five trading days following each put. The size of each put will be capped at $5 million or 100% of the average daily trading volume for the five trading days prior to each put. Profusa will issue cashless warrants to Ascent to purchase 900,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The ELOC is subject to customary closing conditions and will be capped at 19.9% of the company’s total outstanding shares unless shareholder approval is obtained. “Holding Bitcoin on our balance sheet represents a strategic move to safeguard shareholder value and align with a digital future,” CEO Ben Hwang told reporters in a briefing earlier today. Profusa expects to begin purchasing Bitcoin within the week, and will disclose its holdings in quarterly financial reports moving forward.

According to company disclosures, The Blockchain Group has realized a year-to-date BTC yield of 1,373.2%, resulting in gains of 549.3 BTC and €55.5 million. Profusa launches Bitcoin treasury program In other news, biomedicine and digital health company Profusa, Inc. will be launching a Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Ascent Partners Fund LLC, in which the latter will purchase up to $100 million of Profusa’s common stock under an equity line of credit (ELOC). All net proceeds from the ELOC, provided Profusa keeps a cash balance above $5 million at the time of transaction, will be used to acquire Bitcoin. Should the company’s balance fall below that threshold, the proceeds will first be used to replenish reserves before any Bitcoin purchases are made. The shares will be sold at a price equal to 97% of the lowest volume-weighted average price over the five trading days following each put. The size of each put will be capped at $5 million or 100% of the average daily trading volume for the five trading days prior to each put. Profusa will issue cashless warrants to Ascent to purchase 900,000 shares at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. The ELOC is subject to customary closing conditions and will be capped at 19.9% of the company’s total outstanding shares unless shareholder approval is obtained. “Holding Bitcoin on our balance sheet represents a strategic move to safeguard shareholder value and align with a digital future,” CEO Ben Hwang told reporters in a briefing earlier today. Profusa expects to begin purchasing Bitcoin within the week, and will disclose its holdings in quarterly financial reports moving forward.

The amount, now worth about 0.76% of the circulating supply of Ethereum, was attributed to bugs, incorrect contracts, and mistakes in user activity. The losses exceed $3.43 billion at rates held in its current market of around $3,822. As noted by Grogan, this estimate only counts permanently unused ETH, e.g., tokens caught in contracts or burned addresses. It does not include the lost ETH due to forgotten private keys and inactive Genesis wallets, so the actual value may be much larger. Based on my research, a minimum of 913,111 Ethereum is lost forever due to user error.

This constitutes approximately 4-5% of the 120.7 million total supply. The largest loss events remain consistent with Grogan’s 2023 analysis. These include 306,000 ETH lost to the Parity Multisig bug, 60,000 ETH trapped in a QuadrigaCX contract, and 11,500 ETH lost in the Akutars NFT mint failure. There have been minimal changes since last year, and 1,000 more ETH have been sent to burn addresses. Total losses of ETH caused by these mistakes have increased by 44 percent since March 2023, when the figure was 636,000 ETH. “To be clear, this $3.4 billion number significantly undershoots the actual lost/inaccessible ETH amount — it just covers instances where Ethereum is locked forever.” – Conor Grogan Ethereum supply dynamics support bullish thesis The tokenomics of Ethereum have grown more deflationary. Following the Merge in September 2022, the issuance of ETH was significantly reduced as the network technology changed to proof-of-stake. In 2021, EIP-1559 decreased its available supply by burning a small percentage of transaction fees. Prior to the Merge, Ethereum had a total amount of 120.5 million ETH. It has slowly dropped since then, but has since picked up gradual growth in 2024 at 120.7 million. Although Ethereum has no maximum limit, like Bitcoin, its slower issuance has kept inflation at bay. Market participants view this supply tendency as one of the reasons for long-term price increases. According to Lookonchain, Ethereum whales have purchased more than $2.7 billion worth of ETH within a week. According to analysts, the measure is an indication of growing market control and regulatory transparency. ETH gains momentum Ethereum’s price has surged 57.6% over the past month, climbing to a local high of $3,834. It now trades just above $3,800, with analysts expecting a clean breakout past $4,000 if current momentum holds. Whale accumulation, growing institutional interest, and positive regulatory signals are fueling Ethereum’s strong recovery.

This remarkable ascent has captivated investors and analysts alike, sparking renewed optimism about the future trajectory of the leading digital asset. If you’ve been following the market, you know that every major move by Bitcoin sends ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem. Today’s surge is no exception, signaling a potentially bullish phase for the market. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Surge According to diligent market monitoring, the Bitcoin price has indeed climbed above $119,000, specifically noted at $119,030.21 on the Binance USDT market. This isn’t just a number; it’s a psychological and technical milestone that often triggers further momentum. Such movements are rarely isolated incidents; they are typically the culmination of various underlying factors converging to create a powerful upward push. To put this into perspective, let’s look at some recent movements that have contributed to the current bullish sentiment surrounding the Bitcoin price : Increased Institutional Interest: More large financial institutions are allocating capital to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class. Positive Macroeconomic Outlook: A shift in global economic policies or inflation concerns often drives investors towards scarce assets like Bitcoin. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin network, enhancing its scalability and security, bolsters confidence. Growing Retail Adoption: Everyday investors are increasingly participating, driving demand through easy-to-use platforms. The consistent upward pressure on the Bitcoin price indicates a strong demand outweighing the available supply, a fundamental principle of economics that applies equally to digital assets. What’s Fueling This Bitcoin Price Rally? The current rally in the Bitcoin price isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are likely contributing to this impressive performance. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding cryptocurrency landscape. Is Institutional Adoption Pushing the Bitcoin Price Higher? One of the most significant catalysts for Bitcoin’s recent gains is the continued influx of institutional capital. Major investment firms, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are increasingly looking at Bitcoin as a viable investment. The approval and launch of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have provided regulated and accessible avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This institutional embrace adds legitimacy and stability, significantly influencing the Bitcoin price . How Do Global Events Impact the Bitcoin Price? Global economic conditions play a pivotal role. When traditional markets show signs of instability, or when inflation concerns rise, investors often seek alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, is increasingly seen as ‘digital gold’ – a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Central bank policies, interest rate decisions, and geopolitical tensions can all indirectly affect the flow of capital into Bitcoin, thereby influencing its market value and the overall Bitcoin price . Are Technological Developments Affecting the Bitcoin Price? While Bitcoin’s core protocol remains robust, ongoing developments in the broader crypto space, such as advancements in scaling solutions (like the Lightning Network) and increased interoperability with other blockchains, contribute to a healthier ecosystem. These improvements enhance Bitcoin’s utility and efficiency, making it more attractive for transactions and long-term holding. A more functional and adaptable network naturally bolsters confidence and can positively impact the Bitcoin price . Navigating the Volatility: What Does This Mean for Investors? While a surging Bitcoin price is exciting, it’s essential for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. Bitcoin’s history is marked by periods of rapid ascent followed by corrections. Understanding the potential benefits and challenges is key. Benefits of a Rising Bitcoin Price: Capital Appreciation: For existing holders, a rising price means an increase in the value of their portfolio. Increased Market Confidence: Strong performance can attract new investors, further strengthening the market. Validation of the Asset Class: Reaching new highs reinforces Bitcoin’s position as a significant financial asset. Challenges and Risks: Market Volatility: What goes up can come down.

2025-07-21 14:25:15+00:00,Bitcoin Investor’s Astounding $578 Million Profit Journey Unveiled,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investor’s Astounding $578 Million Profit Journey Unveiled The world of cryptocurrency is often characterized by its volatility, but every so often, a story emerges that truly captures the imagination and highlights the incredible potential of early adoption. This is one such tale, focusing on an early Bitcoin investor whose strategic moves have led to an astonishing profit. Imagine turning a modest investment into hundreds of millions of dollars. This isn’t a fantasy; it’s the real-life achievement of a savvy individual who bought into Bitcoin over a decade ago and is now reaping the rewards of their foresight. Who is This Mystery Bitcoin Investor and What’s Their Story? Details about the identity of this particular Bitcoin investor remain shrouded in mystery, as is common in the decentralized world of crypto. However, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain on X (formerly Twitter) has shed light on their incredible journey. Approximately 12 years ago, this individual made a prescient move, investing a mere $1.66 million to acquire a substantial 5,000 Bitcoins. At the time, Bitcoin’s price was a fraction of what it is today, making this a bold, pioneering decision. Fast forward to the present, and this early Bitcoin investor has begun to realize some of their immense gains. Over the past eight months, they have systematically sold portions of their holdings. The latest transaction saw them offload an additional 250 BTC, valued at approximately $29.68 million at the time of sale. This recent sale brings their total realized sales to a staggering 1,000 BTC, cumulatively valued at around $106 million. Despite these significant sales, the investor still retains a substantial 4,000 BTC, a testament to their long-term vision and belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value. Let’s put their journey into perspective with a quick breakdown: Action Details Value Initial Investment Bought 5,000 BTC 12 years ago $1.66 million Recent Sale Sold 250 BTC $29.68 million Total Sales (Past 8 months) Sold 1,000 BTC $106 million Current Holdings Retains 4,000 BTC Varies with market price Total Profit (Realized & Unrealized) 349x return on initial investment $578 million The Astonishing Profit: How Did This Bitcoin Investor Achieve a 349x Return? The numbers speak for themselves: a total profit of $578 million from an initial $1.66 million investment represents an astounding 349x return. This level of profit is almost unheard of in traditional markets and underscores the unique opportunities that early cryptocurrency adoption presented. The primary factor behind this phenomenal gain is simply the passage of time combined with Bitcoin’s exponential price appreciation. When this Bitcoin investor made their initial purchase, Bitcoin was a niche digital asset, largely unknown to the mainstream. Over the past decade, it has evolved from an obscure digital currency to a globally recognized asset class, attracting institutional investors, major corporations, and even nation-states. This journey has been marked by several bull runs and significant corrections, but the overall trend has been undeniably upward. The investor’s strategy was simple yet profoundly effective: buy low and hold for the long term. This approach, often referred to as ‘HODLing’ in the crypto community, requires immense patience and conviction, especially during bear markets when prices can plummet. By holding onto the majority of their assets for over a decade, this Bitcoin investor allowed the power of compounding and market growth to work its magic, transforming a relatively modest sum into a colossal fortune. What Challenges Did This Bitcoin Investor Face Along the Way? While the profit figures are dazzling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the significant challenges and risks that this Bitcoin investor undoubtedly navigated. Holding an asset as volatile as Bitcoin for 12 years is no small feat. Consider these hurdles: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price has experienced numerous dramatic swings, including crashes of 80% or more from its peak. Enduring such downturns without panic-selling requires incredible emotional resilience. Regulatory Uncertainty: Over the years, Bitcoin has faced scrutiny and uncertainty from governments and financial regulators worldwide. The threat of bans or restrictive regulations loomed large at various points. Security Risks: Storing such a large amount of Bitcoin securely for over a decade demands sophisticated cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks, phishing attempts, and other digital threats. Opportunity Cost: During bear markets, there might have been temptations to sell and reinvest in other assets. The decision to stay invested in Bitcoin, despite potential short-term losses, was a long-term play. This investor’s success is not just about luck; it’s also a testament to their unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s potential and their ability to withstand immense market pressure.

Approximately 12 years ago, this individual made a prescient move, investing a mere $1.66 million to acquire a substantial 5,000 Bitcoins. At the time, Bitcoin’s price was a fraction of what it is today, making this a bold, pioneering decision. Fast forward to the present, and this early Bitcoin investor has begun to realize some of their immense gains. Over the past eight months, they have systematically sold portions of their holdings. The latest transaction saw them offload an additional 250 BTC, valued at approximately $29.68 million at the time of sale. This recent sale brings their total realized sales to a staggering 1,000 BTC, cumulatively valued at around $106 million. Despite these significant sales, the investor still retains a substantial 4,000 BTC, a testament to their long-term vision and belief in Bitcoin’s enduring value. Let’s put their journey into perspective with a quick breakdown: Action Details Value Initial Investment Bought 5,000 BTC 12 years ago $1.66 million Recent Sale Sold 250 BTC $29.68 million Total Sales (Past 8 months) Sold 1,000 BTC $106 million Current Holdings Retains 4,000 BTC Varies with market price Total Profit (Realized & Unrealized) 349x return on initial investment $578 million The Astonishing Profit: How Did This Bitcoin Investor Achieve a 349x Return? The numbers speak for themselves: a total profit of $578 million from an initial $1.66 million investment represents an astounding 349x return. This level of profit is almost unheard of in traditional markets and underscores the unique opportunities that early cryptocurrency adoption presented. The primary factor behind this phenomenal gain is simply the passage of time combined with Bitcoin’s exponential price appreciation. When this Bitcoin investor made their initial purchase, Bitcoin was a niche digital asset, largely unknown to the mainstream. Over the past decade, it has evolved from an obscure digital currency to a globally recognized asset class, attracting institutional investors, major corporations, and even nation-states. This journey has been marked by several bull runs and significant corrections, but the overall trend has been undeniably upward. The investor’s strategy was simple yet profoundly effective: buy low and hold for the long term. This approach, often referred to as ‘HODLing’ in the crypto community, requires immense patience and conviction, especially during bear markets when prices can plummet. By holding onto the majority of their assets for over a decade, this Bitcoin investor allowed the power of compounding and market growth to work its magic, transforming a relatively modest sum into a colossal fortune. What Challenges Did This Bitcoin Investor Face Along the Way? While the profit figures are dazzling, it’s crucial to acknowledge the significant challenges and risks that this Bitcoin investor undoubtedly navigated. Holding an asset as volatile as Bitcoin for 12 years is no small feat. Consider these hurdles: Extreme Volatility: Bitcoin’s price has experienced numerous dramatic swings, including crashes of 80% or more from its peak. Enduring such downturns without panic-selling requires incredible emotional resilience. Regulatory Uncertainty: Over the years, Bitcoin has faced scrutiny and uncertainty from governments and financial regulators worldwide. The threat of bans or restrictive regulations loomed large at various points. Security Risks: Storing such a large amount of Bitcoin securely for over a decade demands sophisticated cybersecurity measures to protect against hacks, phishing attempts, and other digital threats. Opportunity Cost: During bear markets, there might have been temptations to sell and reinvest in other assets. The decision to stay invested in Bitcoin, despite potential short-term losses, was a long-term play. This investor’s success is not just about luck; it’s also a testament to their unwavering belief in Bitcoin’s potential and their ability to withstand immense market pressure.

According to the latest data from the US Treasury, China lowered its T-Bill holdings by $900 million, from $757.2 billion in April to $756.3 billion in the month of May. The sell-off marks China’s third straight shedding of Treasuries since February, when the Asian powerhouse held $784.3 billion worth of US bonds. Meanwhile, reports that China is covertly buying much more gold than what public numbers disclose are making the rounds. Stefan Gleason, president and chief executive at Money Metals, tells MarketWatch that China is likely downplaying its gold purchases for efficiency’s sake. “Given how much gold it’s buying, it’s quite sensible for China to limit public disclosures where possible… After all, it’s not in the interest of any bona-fide buyer to take actions that make its purchases more expensive than they need to be.” Joseph Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council, says that there is debate over “whether the PBOC’s (People’s Bank of China) reported purchases fully capture its activity.” The analyst also admitted that there is “always the case that maybe more is going on than is reported.” And Jan Nieuwenhuijs, an analyst at Money Metals, says that China’s gold holdings are likely more than double what is officially reported. Nieuwenhuijs says that “in reality,” the PBOC held 5,065 metric tons of gold in its reserve at the end of 2024, which pales in comparison to its reported holdings of 2,280 metric tons. “China [is] importing much more gold than what is sold in the private market through the Shanghai Gold Exchange, and what industry insiders have shared with me over the years.” The latest data from the World Gold Council shows that China holds 2,296 tonnes of gold worth more than $247 billion.

2025-07-21 14:30:20+00:00,Bitcoin Whale Metrics Flash Mixed Signals: Monthly Inflows Rise And Daily Outflows Start Slowing,"Bitcoin continues to trade within a tight range, consolidating above the $115,000 level and just below the key psychological barrier at $120,000. While the price structure remains bullish, market analysts are increasingly divided. Some expect Bitcoin to break higher toward uncharted territory, while others warn of an incoming correction, citing historical patterns and profit-taking behaviors. Related Reading: Ethereum Open Interest Hits Record $50 Billion – Volatility Incoming? Adding weight to the cautionary outlook, new data from CryptoQuant reveals a significant spike in whale activity. The Whale to Exchange Flow monthly average has surged by nearly $17 billion in just four days. This kind of jump historically coincides with either profit realization or increased volatility, as large holders adjust their positions. Although bulls are still in control of the trend, this level of whale inflow to exchanges may introduce short-term selling pressure, especially as Bitcoin hovers near its all-time high. The coming days could prove pivotal, as market participants assess whether this activity marks the beginning of a larger distribution phase or simply a healthy rotation within a bullish uptrend. Whale Inflows Surge, But Daily Trend Suggests Potential Easing Top analyst Darkfost has drawn attention to a critical development in Bitcoin’s market structure. According to his analysis, during the last two major market tops, exchange inflows from large holders surpassed $75 billion—an event that marked the beginning of a sharp correction or an extended consolidation phase. These inflows are a key signal, often indicating that whales are beginning to distribute their holdings after a strong rally. Currently, the data suggests a similar pattern could be unfolding. Between July 14 and July 18, the Whale to Exchange Flow monthly average surged from $28 billion to $45 billion, marking a $17 billion increase in just four days. While the recent 80,000 BTC transfer—linked to the Satoshi-era whale—likely played a role in this jump, it also reflects a broader trend: whales may be capitalizing on the recent all-time high to lock in profits. However, there’s an important nuance. Darkfost notes that while the monthly average has spiked, daily inflow data shows a noticeable decline. This suggests that the selling pressure from whales may be subsiding—at least temporarily. If the trend continues, it could provide the market with room to stabilize and potentially prepare for another leg up.

2025-07-21 14:30:23+00:00,Public Companies Bitcoin: A Staggering $953M Surge in Corporate Holdings Signals Growing Confidence,"BitcoinWorld Public Companies Bitcoin: A Staggering $953M Surge in Corporate Holdings Signals Growing Confidence The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with a remarkable trend: major public companies are significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings. This past week alone, the corporate sector poured nearly a billion dollars into Bitcoin, signaling a robust and growing confidence in the digital asset’s long-term value. This surge in public companies Bitcoin investment is a powerful testament to its evolving role in traditional finance. Why Are Public Companies Bitcoin Investments Surging? Last week marked a pivotal moment for Bitcoin, as public companies, excluding miners, collectively acquired an astounding $953 million worth of the digital currency. This substantial influx of capital, as reported by SoSoValue data for the week ending July 21, underscores a deepening institutional conviction in Bitcoin’s potential. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it’s a strategic move by corporations looking to diversify their treasuries and hedge against economic uncertainties. The sheer volume of this investment highlights a shift in perception, moving Bitcoin from a speculative asset to a recognized store of value. The leader of this recent buying spree was Strategy, a name synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption. They added a colossal $739.8 million to their reserves, acquiring 6,220 BTC at an average price of $118,940 per coin. This singular purchase alone accounts for a significant portion of the total corporate acquisition last week, further solidifying Strategy’s position as the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Their continued accumulation sends a strong message to the market, often influencing other companies to consider similar strategies. This trend of public companies Bitcoin accumulation suggests a broader acceptance of cryptocurrency as a legitimate asset class. Companies are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation, a secure digital reserve, and a strategic asset for future growth. The transparency of these public disclosures also adds a layer of credibility to the cryptocurrency market, potentially attracting even more mainstream investors. Who Are the Key Players Driving Public Companies Bitcoin Adoption? While Strategy remains the titan in the realm of public companies Bitcoin holdings, the past week saw several new and notable entrants joining the ranks of corporate Bitcoin investors. This diversification of corporate interest indicates that the trend is broadening beyond just a few pioneering firms. Here’s a closer look at the key players in last week’s significant acquisitions: Strategy: As mentioned, Strategy led the charge with an impressive $739.8 million purchase of 6,220 BTC. This brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an astounding 607,770 BTC. Their consistent buying strategy has made them a benchmark for corporate Bitcoin adoption. Sequans: A new and significant player from France, Sequans made a substantial entry into the Bitcoin market, acquiring $150 million worth of Bitcoin, equivalent to 1,264 BTC. This marks a notable European corporate embrace of the digital asset. The Smarter Web: This entity added $36.1 million to their treasury in Bitcoin, securing 325 BTC. Their investment highlights the growing interest from various sectors in integrating Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Semler Scientific: With a $25 million purchase, Semler Scientific acquired 210 BTC. This move by a healthcare company further exemplifies the diverse range of industries now considering Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Blockchain Group: As their name suggests, Blockchain Group, a company deeply rooted in the digital asset space, also made a strategic acquisition of $2.56 million for 22 BTC, reinforcing their commitment to the ecosystem. It’s also worth noting the movements of existing players. Japan’s Metaplanet, after five consecutive weeks of Bitcoin purchases, paused their accumulation last week. While they didn’t add to their holdings, their previous consistent buying demonstrates the sustained interest from international firms in Bitcoin. The collective efforts of these firms have propelled the total Bitcoin holdings by public companies (excluding miners) to 681,680 BTC. At current valuations, this massive stash is worth approximately $80.4 billion, representing about 3.43% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply. This percentage, though seemingly small, signifies a substantial and growing portion of Bitcoin being held by long-term, strategic corporate entities, effectively reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges and potentially impacting future price dynamics.

2025-07-21 14:32:54+00:00,Russia to impose fines for crypto payments next year,"Starting from next year, authorities in Russia are going to impose fines for cryptocurrency payments that have been banned since 2021. According to a new law, the use of digital coins as a means of payment in the country will also be punished with confiscation of the assets involved. Russians will be fined for paying with cryptocurrencies Payments with decentralized digital currencies like Bitcoin will result in substantial fines for Russian citizens and businesses from 2026 onwards, the local press reported, quoting a prominent member of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. The government’s plan was revealed to Izvestia by Anatoly Aksakov, head of the chamber’s Committee on Financial Markets. He told the Daily that deputies will consider a bill introducing the penalties this fall in order to define liability in a currently gray area. According to the legislation, drafted jointly by the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, private individuals who pay with crypto will face fines in the range of 100-200,000 rubles (over $2,500), and companies will be fined between 700,000 and 1 million rubles (almost $13,000). Additionally, it provides for the seizure by the state of the illegally used coins, the newspaper noted. In April, the executive power in Moscow approved amendments legalizing the confiscation of cryptocurrency by recognizing it as property in criminal proceedings. Since Jan. 1, this year, crypto assets have been recognized as property also in the Tax Code in order to regulate the taxation of related activities such as mining, which was legalized in 2024, and trading, which is allowed under limited circumstances. While the exact amounts of the monetary penalties were announced by the Director of the Legal Department at the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ), Andrey Medvedev, during the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum in May, it was unclear when they would be enforced. Russia faces numerous use cases for crypto in payments Russia’s monetary authority has been a strong opponent to legalizing domestic crypto payments, maintaining that the ruble, including its digital form, should remain the only legal tender. At the same time, it also agreed to oversee an “experimental legal regime” (ELR) facilitating crypto exchange and settlements in foreign trade to help Russian firms bypass Western sanctions. Using cryptos to pay for goods and services has been banned in Russia since the enforcement of the law “On Digital Financial Assets” (DFAs) in 2021. Despite that, Russians have been spending digital coins, and such transactions scored a 2.5 increase in the first year of the war in Ukraine, which started in 2022. The use cases include not only transfers of funds abroad, in circumvention of financial restrictions, but also remunerating employees, like developers who moved to other countries. Last week, Izvestia quoted labor authorities warning that paying salaries in crypto will also result in hefty fines for companies. Cryptocurrency payment is often associated with unofficial employment, Alexey Gorelkin, a specialist in the field of information security, told the publication. He elaborated: “This is a common option for Russian citizens who do remote work in our country for companies outside of Russia. At the same time, Russian companies rarely work directly with crypto, preferring to use it as additional motivation, as property incentive rather than wages.” Video games have provided another opportunity to employ digital currencies in payments, with Web3 platforms often opting to transact in a cryptocurrency generated within their gaming projects, according to Ivan Kalmykov, an IT expert quoted by the daily. Various services and Telegram bots processing crypto payments, including through QR codes , have been quite popular in Russia as well. An estimate suggests that up to 400 of these continued to operate two years after the enforcement of the coin payment ban.

Russia faces numerous use cases for crypto in payments Russia’s monetary authority has been a strong opponent to legalizing domestic crypto payments, maintaining that the ruble, including its digital form, should remain the only legal tender. At the same time, it also agreed to oversee an “experimental legal regime” (ELR) facilitating crypto exchange and settlements in foreign trade to help Russian firms bypass Western sanctions. Using cryptos to pay for goods and services has been banned in Russia since the enforcement of the law “On Digital Financial Assets” (DFAs) in 2021. Despite that, Russians have been spending digital coins, and such transactions scored a 2.5 increase in the first year of the war in Ukraine, which started in 2022. The use cases include not only transfers of funds abroad, in circumvention of financial restrictions, but also remunerating employees, like developers who moved to other countries. Last week, Izvestia quoted labor authorities warning that paying salaries in crypto will also result in hefty fines for companies. Cryptocurrency payment is often associated with unofficial employment, Alexey Gorelkin, a specialist in the field of information security, told the publication. He elaborated: “This is a common option for Russian citizens who do remote work in our country for companies outside of Russia. At the same time, Russian companies rarely work directly with crypto, preferring to use it as additional motivation, as property incentive rather than wages.” Video games have provided another opportunity to employ digital currencies in payments, with Web3 platforms often opting to transact in a cryptocurrency generated within their gaming projects, according to Ivan Kalmykov, an IT expert quoted by the daily. Various services and Telegram bots processing crypto payments, including through QR codes , have been quite popular in Russia as well. An estimate suggests that up to 400 of these continued to operate two years after the enforcement of the coin payment ban.

Unpacking These Impressive Stock Market Records The financial world buzzed with excitement as both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices achieved new intraday record highs. For context: S&P 500: Represents 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, a key gauge of the American economy’s health.

Anticipation of Interest Rate Cuts: Growing anticipation of future rate cuts makes borrowing cheaper, stimulates economic activity, and can make stocks more attractive.
