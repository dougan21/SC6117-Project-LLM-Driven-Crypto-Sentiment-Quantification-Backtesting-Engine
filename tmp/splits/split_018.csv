2025-07-28 03:10:11+00:00,Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Massive 24-Hour Market Shockwaves,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Massive 24-Hour Market Shockwaves In the fast-paced world of digital assets, volatility isn’t just a buzzword; it’s a constant companion. Every day, millions of dollars shift hands, and fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye. For those deeply entrenched in the derivatives market, especially perpetual futures , understanding the mechanics of market movements is paramount. Recently, the crypto space witnessed a significant event: a substantial crypto futures liquidation breakdown over a mere 24-hour period. These events are not just numbers; they represent forced closures of leveraged positions, sending ripples across the entire market. What exactly happened, and what crucial lessons can traders glean from this? What is Crypto Futures Liquidation and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what crypto futures liquidation truly entails. In essence, it’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. When you trade futures with leverage, you’re borrowing funds to amplify your potential gains – but also your potential losses. If the market moves significantly against your position, your collateral (margin) might fall below the exchange’s maintenance margin requirement. At this point, to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange, the position is automatically closed, or “liquidated.” Perpetual futures, unlike traditional futures contracts, have no expiry date. They use a funding rate mechanism to keep their price anchored to the spot price of the underlying asset. This makes them incredibly popular for speculative trading, but also amplifies the risks associated with leverage. A large liquidation event can trigger a cascade, as positions are closed, pushing prices further in the direction of the initial move, leading to more liquidations. This phenomenon is often referred to as a “liquidation cascade” or “liquidation squeeze.” The Recent 24-Hour Crypto Futures Liquidation Breakdown: Who Got Hit? The past 24 hours have provided a stark reminder of the market’s unforgiving nature, particularly for those with leveraged positions. Here’s a look at the significant figures from the recent crypto futures liquidation event: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (USD) Percentage of Short Positions Liquidated Bitcoin (BTC) $44.02 million 93.46% Short Ethereum (ETH) $69.21 million 80.99% Short VINE $9.41 million 79.25% Short These numbers reveal a compelling story. What’s particularly striking is the overwhelming percentage of short positions that were liquidated across Bitcoin, Ethereum, and VINE. This indicates that the market experienced a significant upward price movement within that 24-hour window, catching a large number of traders who were betting on prices to fall. When prices surge unexpectedly, short sellers face mounting losses. If their margin falls below the threshold, their positions are automatically closed, contributing to these liquidation figures. What Do These Crypto Futures Liquidation Figures Signal for Traders? The breakdown of these liquidation figures offers several critical insights for anyone involved in crypto trading: Market Sentiment Shift: A high percentage of short liquidations often suggests a sudden bullish momentum or a “short squeeze.” This happens when an upward price movement forces short sellers to buy back assets to cover their positions, further fueling the price increase. Increased Volatility: Liquidation events are a byproduct of, and also a contributor to, heightened market volatility. The forced selling (or buying, in the case of short liquidations) can create significant price swings. Risk of Cascade Effects: Large liquidations can trigger a domino effect. As one position is closed, it can push the price further, leading to more liquidations, creating a feedback loop that exacerbates price movements. Importance of Risk Management: These events underscore the absolute necessity of robust risk management strategies. Excessive leverage, without adequate collateral or stop-loss orders, is a recipe for disaster. Navigating the Storm: Actionable Insights for Trading with Crypto Futures Liquidation in Mind While liquidation events can be daunting, they also offer crucial lessons and opportunities for savvy traders. Here’s how you can better navigate the volatile landscape of crypto futures: Master Leverage Wisely: Leverage is a double-edged sword. While it can magnify profits, it equally amplifies losses. Understand your risk tolerance and use leverage judiciously. A common beginner mistake is using too much leverage, too soon. Implement Strict Risk Management: Stop-Loss Orders: Always set stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. This is your primary defense against unexpected market moves. Position Sizing: Never allocate too much of your portfolio to a single trade, especially a highly leveraged one.

BNB Hits New ATH, XRP and ETH Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is rising again with Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Binance Coin (BNB) posting stronger gains than Bitcoin in the last 24 hours. While Bitcoin is holding its ground above $119,000, it’s the altcoins that are making headlines today. According to CoinMarketCap, the total global crypto market cap now stands at $3.96 trillion, up 1.82% in the last day. Bitcoin dominance is starting to slide, allowing altcoins to shine. The Fear & Greed Index is currently at 67, showing that investor sentiment has firmly moved into the “Greed” zone. Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Breakout Ethereum is leading today’s rally, currently trading above $3,890, up over 3% in the last 24 hours. Traders believe ETH may soon cross the $4,000 mark if the momentum continues. An important resistance zone is between $4,200–$4,300, which could trigger the next wave of buying. BNB Hits New All-Time High BNB, the native token of Binance, is one of the strongest performers, jumping over 6% today and nearly 12% over the week to reach $851—a new all-time high. The move confirms that investors are rotating profits from Bitcoin into top-tier altcoins. Liquidity is spreading across the market, fueling short-term rallies across various tokens. XRP Follows with Solid Gains XRP also saw a healthy bullish trend, trading at $3.27 with over 5.8% weekly gains. While the Ripple vs SEC legal drama still lingers, market interest in XRP remains strong, partly due to ETF speculation and growing global adoption. What’s Driving the Market? Several factors are pushing the market higher: Bitcoin Weekly Close: BTC recently had its highest weekly close ever, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Macro Relief: The U.S. and China agreed to pause tariffs for 90 days, and the U.S. struck a trade deal with the EU, easing investor fears. USDT and BTC Dominance Falling: With stablecoin and Bitcoin dominance slipping, altcoins are attracting fresh capital. Positive Technicals: Many coins broke past resistance levels, setting the stage for potential breakouts. What’s Next? The analyst said that we are still in the middle of a bull cycle. The next major top to form around October or November, based on global liquidity trends and political timelines like the Crypto Market Structure Bill vote expected in September.

2025-07-28 03:30:59+00:00,Best Crypto Presale To Buy Now: Is MAGACOIN FINANCE The Most Likely 100x Token for 2025? TOKEN6900 & HYPER Gain Major FOMO,"Three new presales are generating serious FOMO—are any of them the next 100x gem? As Bitcoin stabilizes near $118K and Ethereum eyes $4K, crypto capital is surging back into altcoins—especially early-stage tokens with bold narratives. MAGACOIN FINANCE, Token6900, and HYPER are leading the charge. Each offers a unique angle—meme power, infrastructure innovation, or ideological alignment—and all three are drawing early investors looking for the best crypto presale to buy now . 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Crypto Presale to Watch MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a true standout among 2025’s new crypto launches. More than just another meme-powered altcoin, it seamlessly combines cultural relevance with a decentralized, community-driven approach. The project is built to reflect ideological values and strong governance, aiming to be more than a momentary trend—it’s positioning itself as a long-term force in the political memecoin space. Analyst sentiment is increasingly bullish. Many now consider MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most strategically positioned early-stage tokens on the market. With plans for a DAO launch and multiple exchange listings in the pipeline, investor attention is ramping up. It’s not just the meme that’s drawing buyers—it’s the mission and roadmap. For investors seeking early access to a project designed for sustained impact, MAGACOIN FINANCE is consistently named the best crypto presale to buy now. 2. Token6900: Meme Momentum on the Rise Token6900 (T6900) is riding the meme coin wave with smart tokenomics and a high-energy community. With over $630,000 raised and staking already live, T6900 offers strong short-term upside and has been compared to SPX6900. Its capped supply and “non-corrupt” branding resonate with retail traders hungry for clean launches and big gains. As its presale pricing rises daily, T6900 is gaining serious traction as one of the best crypto presales to buy now for meme-driven returns. 3. HYPER: Infrastructure Utility Meets Hype Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is a Layer-2 project using Solana tech to scale Bitcoin transactions. With over $3.5 million raised , staking live, and a growing community, HYPER is one of the few presales merging meme interest with real utility. AI models project up to 25x returns post-launch , making HYPER a compelling entry for investors looking beyond hype. If utility and speed matter to you, HYPER stands out as a top pick. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads the Pack No question about it—2025’s presale scene is awash with energy and fresh opportunities. Token6900 and HYPER are both attracting their share of attention—one with meme coin energy, the other with infrastructure promise.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Token6900, and HYPER are leading the charge. Each offers a unique angle—meme power, infrastructure innovation, or ideological alignment—and all three are drawing early investors looking for the best crypto presale to buy now . 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Top Crypto Presale to Watch MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a true standout among 2025’s new crypto launches. More than just another meme-powered altcoin, it seamlessly combines cultural relevance with a decentralized, community-driven approach. The project is built to reflect ideological values and strong governance, aiming to be more than a momentary trend—it’s positioning itself as a long-term force in the political memecoin space. Analyst sentiment is increasingly bullish. Many now consider MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the most strategically positioned early-stage tokens on the market. With plans for a DAO launch and multiple exchange listings in the pipeline, investor attention is ramping up. It’s not just the meme that’s drawing buyers—it’s the mission and roadmap. For investors seeking early access to a project designed for sustained impact, MAGACOIN FINANCE is consistently named the best crypto presale to buy now. 2. Token6900: Meme Momentum on the Rise Token6900 (T6900) is riding the meme coin wave with smart tokenomics and a high-energy community. With over $630,000 raised and staking already live, T6900 offers strong short-term upside and has been compared to SPX6900.

At the forefront of this revolution in Japan stands Metaplanet, a publicly traded company that has consistently demonstrated a bold vision for its financial future. Their latest move? A significant acquisition of 780 additional Bitcoin (BTC), cementing their position as a formidable institutional player in the crypto space. This strategic decision by Metaplanet Bitcoin is not just a headline; it’s a powerful statement about the growing confidence in digital currencies among established corporations, especially within a highly regulated market like Japan. Metaplanet Bitcoin : A Deep Dive into Their Latest Strategic Move In a move that underscores its unwavering commitment to Bitcoin, Metaplanet recently announced, via its official X account, the purchase of an additional 780 BTC. This substantial acquisition significantly boosts the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings, bringing their cumulative investment to an impressive 117.132 BTC. For context, this places Metaplanet among a select group of publicly traded companies globally with substantial Bitcoin treasuries, highlighting their conviction in the long-term value proposition of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Metaplanet’s journey into Bitcoin began with an initial strategic allocation, and subsequent acquisitions have steadily increased their exposure. This latest purchase, made during a period of fluctuating market dynamics, signals a calculated long-term strategy rather than short-term speculation. It reflects a deeper understanding of Bitcoin’s role as a potential hedge against inflation and a store of value in an uncertain global economic landscape. The decision to further invest in Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings demonstrates a proactive approach to capital allocation, aiming to preserve and grow shareholder value. To illustrate the growth of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin treasury, consider the following approximate milestones: Date (Approx.) Event/Announcement Approximate BTC Holdings Significance Early 2024 Initial Strategic Bitcoin Adoption ~1,000 – 5,000 BTC Marked Metaplanet’s entry into the Bitcoin space. Mid-2024 Multiple Incremental Acquisitions ~5,000 – 10,000 BTC Consistent accumulation demonstrated long-term conviction. Recent Announcement Acquisition of additional 780 BTC 117.132 BTC (total) Solidifies Metaplanet’s position as a major institutional holder. This steady accumulation strategy showcases Metaplanet’s methodical approach to integrating Bitcoin into its corporate treasury. Why Are Companies Like Metaplanet Embracing Bitcoin? The decision by a publicly traded company, especially one based in Japan with its stringent regulatory environment, to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin is not taken lightly. Several compelling reasons drive this trend among forward-thinking corporations, and Metaplanet’s strategy likely aligns with many of these: Inflation Hedge: In an era of monetary expansion, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it resistant to inflationary pressures that can devalue fiat currencies. Strategic Diversification: Allocating a portion of treasury to Bitcoin diversifies assets beyond traditional financial instruments, aiming to reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable long-term growth. Companies believing in the future of digital assets see Bitcoin as an investment with substantial upside potential. Pioneering Digital Transformation: Embracing Bitcoin signals a company’s commitment to innovation. For Metaplanet Bitcoin , this enhances its brand image and market appeal. These factors collectively paint a picture of a calculated and strategic pivot towards digital assets, driven by a desire for financial resilience and long-term value creation. The Broader Landscape: Institutional Bitcoin Adoption in Japan and Beyond Metaplanet’s substantial Metaplanet Bitcoin holdings are part of a larger, global trend of institutional adoption, but their move is particularly noteworthy within the Japanese context. Japan has historically been a significant player in the crypto space, known for its progressive regulatory framework.

But as capabilities grow, so does a more profound unease – who governs these agents, and by what rules? A handful of corporations are controlling access, performance and alignment. This centralization of intelligence data raises suspicions and a lack of trust. Trust in AI (artificial intelligence) is not just about whether it works. It’s about who controls it, how it evolves and whether its behavior can be audited, questioned or improved. In a centralized system, those questions are answered, if at all, behind closed doors. Blockchain and Web 3.0 technologies offer a compelling alternative – decentralization as a design principle. Rather than trusting a company, we verify the system. Rather than relying on goodwill, we rely on protocol. The trust problem in centralized AI The black-box nature of proprietary AI models limits transparency. Their training data, optimization strategies and update cycles are opaque. Worse, these models often operate in high-stakes environments, making decisions that affect people’s finances, health or rights. Without a clear understanding of how these decisions are made, trust becomes blind. There’s also the concentration of infrastructure. The compute resources, data pipelines and deployment channels for advanced AI are primarily housed in private data centers. This creates points of failure and reinforces a power imbalance, where end users become passive consumers of intelligence they cannot shape or interrogate. Incentive structures compound the issue. Traditional AI development lacks mechanisms to reward verifiable contributions or penalize harmful behavior. An agent that misbehaves suffers no cost unless its owner intervenes, and that owner may prioritize profitability over ethics. What blockchain brings to the table Blockchain offers a trustless architecture where AI systems can be governed, audited and incentivized in transparent, programmable ways. One of the most profound shifts it enables is the ability to embed accountability directly into the AI stack. Reputation becomes quantifiable. For instance, ABTs (AgentBound Tokens) are non-transferable cryptographic credentials proposed to track an AI agent’s conduct. If an agent wants to perform high-stakes actions, it must stake its reputation. Misbehavior results in slashing, while good performance reinforces its credibility. This creates economic alignment between the agent’s incentives and human expectations. Blockchain also introduces auditability – by recording data origin, training history and decision logs on-chain, stakeholders can verify how and why a model made a particular choice. Equally important is infrastructure decentralization. AI today is bottlenecked by the physical and economic constraints of centralized data centers. With the rise of DePIN and decentralized storage systems like IPFS, AI workloads can be distributed across global participants. This reduces costs, increases resilience and also breaks the monopoly over who gets to build, train and deploy models. Multi-agent systems need shared rails Autonomous agents are not isolated entities – increasingly, they must interact, whether to coordinate logistics, pricing services or optimize supply chains. Without shared protocols and interoperable standards, these agents remain confined within their silos, unable to compose or collaborate. Public blockchains provide the rails for agent-to-agent coordination. Smart contracts allow agents to make enforceable agreements. Tokenized incentives align behavior across networks. A marketplace of services emerges where agents can buy compute, sell data and negotiate outcomes – without relying on centralized intermediaries. Today, we can see prototyped ecosystem frameworks where agents operate semi-independently, staking tokens, verifying each other’s outputs and transacting based on shared economic logic. It’s an overlay network for machine coordination, native to the internet. Federated learning without a central brain Training AI collaboratively across different parties without pooling sensitive data is a major frontier. FL (federated learning) allows this by keeping data local and sharing only model updates. But most FL implementations still rely on a central server to coordinate aggregation – a potential choke point and attack surface. DFL (decentralized federated learning) removes this middleman. With blockchain as the coordination layer, updates can be shared peer-to-peer, verified through consensus and logged immutably.

The latest acquisition brings its total holdings to 17,132 BTC, marking a sharp climb from the 13,350 reported just a month ago. The company disclosed the purchase in a filing on Monday, noting it paid an average of 17.52m yen (US$119,136) per Bitcoin, amounting to a total investment of 13.67b yen ($92.93m). Since launching its Bitcoin Treasury Operations in Dec. 2024, Metaplanet has steadily accumulated Bitcoin using proceeds from capital market activities and operating income. *Metaplanet Acquires Additional 780 $BTC , Total Holdings Reach 17,132 BTC* pic.twitter.com/0gw3HwpUCH — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) July 28, 2025 Metaplanet Trading Volume Doubles in Crypto-Fueled Frenzy The new purchase comes as the firm’s share trading activity on the Tokyo Stock Exchange has surged . Trading volume in Metaplanet stock hit 1.86 trillion yen ($12.65b) in June, nearly doubling the 997.6b yen ($6.78b) recorded in May, according to TSE data. The sharp rise reflects growing investor interest as the company leans further into its digital asset strategy. In the past three months alone, Metaplanet’s Bitcoin holdings have grown by over 13,000 BTC. This expansion has been financed through multiple rounds of share issuances and bond redemptions. On July 4 and again on July 14, the company redeemed a combined 12.75b yen ($86.7m) from its 19th series of bonds, using funds raised through the exercise of stock acquisition rights. Those rights have translated into rapid share dilution. Between June 30 and July 28, the company issued tens of millions of new shares through its 20th to 22nd series of stock acquisition programs. Fully diluted shares outstanding now stand at nearly 866m. Metaplanet’s Q2 BTC Yield Surges to 129.4% To evaluate whether this aggressive capital strategy benefits shareholders, Metaplanet tracks several custom metrics like BTC Yield, BTC Gain and BTC ¥ Gain. These indicators aim to measure how much Bitcoin the company has accumulated relative to its expanding share base and to estimate the hypothetical accretion had no new shares been issued. From July 1 to July 28 alone, Metaplanet’s BTC Yield stood at 22.5%. In yen terms, that gain equates to more than 52.5b yen ($357m). Previous quarters have seen even stronger growth, with a 129.4% BTC Yield in Q2 2025 and an eye-popping 309.8% in Q4 2024. The average purchase price across all 17,132 Bitcoin now sits at roughly 14.78m yen ($100,504) per coin. That number has steadily risen alongside Metaplanet’s appetite for the asset, up from 12.94m yen ($87,992) at the end of March. Crypto Metrics Not a Substitute for Cash Flow, Metaplanet Says The company acknowledges that these metrics are not substitutes for traditional financial indicators such as cash flow or net income. However, it argues they reflect the success of its strategy to grow Bitcoin per share. It believes this metric will become increasingly valuable to long-term investors. Metaplanet has not declared any dividends so far. Instead, it has reminded shareholders that owning its stock does not mean direct ownership of the underlying Bitcoin. Additionally, the company has cautioned that its custom KPIs do not account for debt obligations or preferred stock. As a result, these metrics may overstate gains if taken outside the broader financial context.

2025-07-28 04:25:11+00:00,Spot Ethereum ETF Mania: U.S. Funds Witness Astounding $1.85 Billion Inflow,"BitcoinWorld Spot Ethereum ETF Mania: U.S. Funds Witness Astounding $1.85 Billion Inflow The world of digital assets is once again capturing global attention, and for good reason. U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF products have just marked a truly remarkable week, attracting a staggering $1.85 billion in net inflows. This colossal sum isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal of growing institutional and retail confidence in Ethereum and the broader cryptocurrency market. For anyone tracking the evolution of digital finance, this development is nothing short of pivotal. What Exactly is a Spot Ethereum ETF and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the specifics of these recent inflows, let’s quickly clarify what a Spot Ethereum ETF is. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which track the price of futures contracts, a spot ETF directly holds the underlying asset—in this case, Ethereum. This direct exposure is a game-changer for several reasons: Accessibility: It allows traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without needing to directly buy, store, or manage the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies the investment process significantly. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of these ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) provides a stamp of legitimacy, integrating digital assets further into mainstream finance. Liquidity: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, offering enhanced liquidity and ease of trading compared to direct crypto purchases on less regulated platforms. The existence of a Spot Ethereum ETF product opens new avenues for capital flow into the crypto ecosystem, making it a critical development for market maturation. The Astonishing Inflow: Breaking Down the Numbers for Spot Ethereum ETF According to data from SoSoValue, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF s collectively saw a net inflow of $1.85 billion last week. This impressive figure represents the second-largest weekly inflow since their inception, underscoring a strong resurgence in investor appetite for Ethereum-backed products. To put this into perspective, let’s compare it with the performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin (BTC) ETFs during the same period: Asset Type Weekly Net Inflow U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs $1.85 Billion U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs $72.06 Million The difference is stark. While Bitcoin ETFs continue to attract capital, the magnitude of inflows into Spot Ethereum ETF s highlights a distinct shift in focus and a significant vote of confidence in Ethereum’s potential. This indicates that investors are increasingly diversifying their digital asset portfolios beyond just Bitcoin. What’s Driving This Phenomenal Spot Ethereum ETF Demand? Several factors are contributing to this surge in demand for Spot Ethereum ETF s: Regulatory Momentum: The SEC’s approval of these ETFs removed a major hurdle, providing institutional investors with the regulatory clarity they often require. This green light has unlocked substantial capital from traditional finance. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Strength: Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a foundational blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps). Its robust and evolving ecosystem makes it an attractive long-term investment. Anticipation of Future Growth: Many investors view Ethereum as a high-growth asset, particularly with ongoing network upgrades (like the upcoming Pectra upgrade) aimed at improving scalability and efficiency. Diversification Play: For institutions and high-net-worth individuals, a Spot Ethereum ETF offers a strategic way to diversify their exposure within the crypto sector, moving beyond a Bitcoin-only strategy. Market Sentiment Shift: A broader positive sentiment towards digital assets, fueled by Bitcoin’s recent rally and increasing mainstream acceptance, has created a fertile ground for new investment products like the Spot Ethereum ETF . Impact on the Crypto Market: What Does This Mean for ETH and Beyond? The substantial inflows into Spot Ethereum ETF s carry significant implications for the entire cryptocurrency market: Price Action for ETH: Increased demand from ETFs can directly influence Ethereum’s price by reducing the available supply on exchanges. While short-term volatility is always possible, sustained inflows suggest upward price pressure over time. Validation of Ethereum: These inflows serve as a strong validation of Ethereum’s role as a leading blockchain and a legitimate investment asset, further cementing its position alongside Bitcoin. Broader Market Confidence: The success of Spot Ethereum ETF s could pave the way for other altcoin ETFs, signaling a maturing market where diverse digital assets gain institutional acceptance. This could bring more capital into the overall crypto space.

2025-07-28 04:34:53+00:00,"The S&P 500 broke above 6,400 after the U.S. and EU agreed to lower tariffs to 15%.","The S&P 500 pushed past the 6,400 line late Sunday night after U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed Sunday evening that the United States had finalized a tariff deal with the European Union, cutting levies down to 15% from the previously threatened 30%. That announcement sent futures higher across the board and kicked off a rally that pulled Bitcoin back up to $120,000 for the first time in nearly two weeks. Contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by 180 points (0.4%). S&P 500 futures climbed 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.4%. The sudden spike followed the White House’s confirmation of a successful trade agreement with the EU. Trump had been threatening a heavy 30% tariff on EU imports before this adjustment. That walk-back was enough to send risk appetite back through the roof. Bitcoin, which had been swinging between $114,000 and $119,000, cleared $120,000 and was just $3,080 shy of its all-time high. Traders watch earnings, Fed, and Trump’s August 1 deadline The week is already loaded with pressure points. Wall Street will see earnings from top tech companies, a closely watched Federal Reserve meeting, inflation numbers, and Trump’s own August 1 tariff deadline. Even before Trump’s Sunday announcement, U.S. equities had ended the previous week strong. On Friday, the Dow added 208.01 points, ending at 44,901.92. The S&P 500 closed at 6,388.64, its 14th record finish of the year and fifth straight day of new highs. The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday at 21,108.32, also setting a fresh record, its 15th this year. Wall Street’s optimism last week had already been helped by solid earnings and other trade negotiations with countries like Japan and Indonesia. But with new tariffs off the table for now, markets had extra fuel going into Monday. The rally also lifted commodities. Gold traded near $3,335 an ounce after losing 0.4% last week. The yellow metal has still risen more than 25% this year, as investors continue to seek safety amid geopolitical uncertainty, including ongoing conflict in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East. After briefly crossing $3,500 an ounce back in April, the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that fund managers had raised bullish positions on gold to the highest point in 16 weeks. Europe mostly flat as Asia-Pacific reacts to U.S. momentum The reaction in Europe was mixed, as the FTSE MIB in Italy rose by 126.58 points to close at 40,726.26, up 0.31%. OMXS30 in Sweden moved 0.23% higher to 2,606.32. Denmark’s OMXC 25 climbed 0.26%, while Finland’s HEX inched up 0.04%. Other markets in the region were flat. Germany’s DAX remained at 24,217.5. France’s CAC 40, the STOXX600, AEX, BEL 20, SMI, and PSI20 all showed no movement. The UK’s FTSE fell 18.06 points, or 0.2%, closing at 9,120.31. Spain’s IBEX 35 dropped by 19.2 points, or 0.13%, ending the session at 14,237.3. In currency markets, the euro-dollar pair moved up slightly to 1.175, while the British pound stayed at 1.344 with almost no change. The Japanese yen traded at 147.85 against the dollar after a 0.13% increase. The U.S. dollar index stood at 97.62, up just 0.01%. The Asia-Pacific session opened with mixed sentiment. At 10 a.m. in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was up 0.49%, extending momentum from the U.S. session. But elsewhere, traders were waiting. Mainland China’s CSI 300 was flat ahead of U.S.-China trade talks scheduled to begin later Monday in Stockholm. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.85%, and the broader Topix slid 0.44%. In South Korea, the Kospi edged up 0.15%, while the Kosdaq stayed flat. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Nasdaq Composite ended Friday at 21,108.32, also setting a fresh record, its 15th this year. Wall Street’s optimism last week had already been helped by solid earnings and other trade negotiations with countries like Japan and Indonesia. But with new tariffs off the table for now, markets had extra fuel going into Monday. The rally also lifted commodities. Gold traded near $3,335 an ounce after losing 0.4% last week. The yellow metal has still risen more than 25% this year, as investors continue to seek safety amid geopolitical uncertainty, including ongoing conflict in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East. After briefly crossing $3,500 an ounce back in April, the latest data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed that fund managers had raised bullish positions on gold to the highest point in 16 weeks. Europe mostly flat as Asia-Pacific reacts to U.S. momentum The reaction in Europe was mixed, as the FTSE MIB in Italy rose by 126.58 points to close at 40,726.26, up 0.31%. OMXS30 in Sweden moved 0.23% higher to 2,606.32. Denmark’s OMXC 25 climbed 0.26%, while Finland’s HEX inched up 0.04%. Other markets in the region were flat. Germany’s DAX remained at 24,217.5. France’s CAC 40, the STOXX600, AEX, BEL 20, SMI, and PSI20 all showed no movement. The UK’s FTSE fell 18.06 points, or 0.2%, closing at 9,120.31. Spain’s IBEX 35 dropped by 19.2 points, or 0.13%, ending the session at 14,237.3. In currency markets, the euro-dollar pair moved up slightly to 1.175, while the British pound stayed at 1.344 with almost no change. The Japanese yen traded at 147.85 against the dollar after a 0.13% increase. The U.S. dollar index stood at 97.62, up just 0.01%. The Asia-Pacific session opened with mixed sentiment. At 10 a.m. in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was up 0.49%, extending momentum from the U.S. session. But elsewhere, traders were waiting. Mainland China’s CSI 300 was flat ahead of U.S.-China trade talks scheduled to begin later Monday in Stockholm. Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 0.85%, and the broader Topix slid 0.44%. In South Korea, the Kospi edged up 0.15%, while the Kosdaq stayed flat. In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.2%. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

This is precisely what happened recently when a dedicated individual achieved the near-impossible: a solo miner successfully mined a Bitcoin (BTC) block, securing a staggering 3.16 BTC. This extraordinary feat, recorded at block height 907,465 on July 28, according to blockchain explorer Mempool, resulted in a reward valued at approximately $377,500. It’s a moment that highlights the sheer unpredictability and immense potential rewards within the world of Solo Bitcoin Mining , inspiring countless enthusiasts and demonstrating that sometimes, against all odds, a single miner can indeed strike digital gold. What Exactly is Solo Bitcoin Mining? In the vast and competitive landscape of cryptocurrency, Solo Bitcoin Mining stands out as a high-stakes endeavor. Unlike most miners who join large mining pools to combine their computational power and share rewards, a solo miner operates independently. This means they dedicate their entire hash rate – the total computational power used to mine – to finding a block on their own. If successful, they keep the entire block reward, which currently includes the block subsidy (6.25 BTC, though this particular miner received a smaller amount due to transaction fees being part of the 3.16 BTC total reward) plus any transaction fees associated with the block. The concept is simple: you’re trying to solve a complex cryptographic puzzle before anyone else in the world. The reality, however, is anything but. The difficulty of mining Bitcoin blocks adjusts roughly every two weeks, ensuring that new blocks are found approximately every 10 minutes. As more miners join the network, the difficulty increases, making it exponentially harder for any single entity to find a block. How Does Bitcoin Mining Work and Why is it So Difficult? At its core, Bitcoin mining is the process of adding new transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners use powerful computers to solve a complex computational puzzle, which is essentially finding a hash (a string of numbers and letters) that is less than or equal to a target set by the network. This process is known as Proof-of-Work (PoW). Here’s a simplified breakdown: Transaction Verification: Miners gather unconfirmed transactions into a block. Puzzle Solving: They then try to find a ‘nonce’ (a number used only once) that, when combined with the block’s data and hashed, produces a result below the network’s target difficulty. Block Discovery: The first miner to find this nonce broadcasts their solution to the network. Reward: If other nodes verify the solution, the block is added to the blockchain, and the successful miner receives the block reward (newly minted BTC) and transaction fees. The difficulty is immense because the network’s total hash rate is colossal. Global Bitcoin mining operations utilize specialized hardware called ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) that perform trillions of calculations per second. For a solo miner, their individual hash rate is a minuscule fraction of the global total, making the probability of finding a block akin to winning a lottery where there are billions of tickets, and you only hold one. What are the Astronomical Odds Against a Solo Bitcoin Miner? The odds of a solo miner finding a block are incredibly slim, often described as lottery-like. To put it into perspective, consider the current network hash rate, which can be in the exahashes per second (EH/s). A single, high-end ASIC miner might contribute a few hundred terahashes per second (TH/s). An exahash is 1,000,000 terahashes. This means one miner’s contribution is a tiny drop in a massive ocean of computational power. The probability of a miner finding a block is directly proportional to their share of the total network hash rate. If a solo miner possesses, say, 0.0000001% of the total network hash rate, their chance of finding the next block is also 0.0000001%. This is why the news of a solo miner succeeding generates such buzz – it’s a testament to incredible luck and persistence, highlighting the rare success stories in Solo Bitcoin Mining . Why Do Miners Still Attempt Solo Bitcoin Mining? Given the overwhelming odds, one might wonder why anyone would even bother with Solo Bitcoin Mining . The answer lies in the allure of the full block reward. While joining a mining pool offers more consistent, albeit smaller, payouts, a solo miner stands to gain the entire bounty. For this particular miner, that meant a reward of 3.16 BTC, which at the time was valued at a significant $377,500. This lump sum can be life-changing, whereas pooled mining typically distributes fractions of BTC daily or weekly. Beyond the financial incentive, some solo miners are driven by ideological reasons.

The announcement sent S&P 500 futures up 0.3%, Dow contracts higher by 180 points and Bitcoin (BTC) to nearly $120,000 for the first time in nearly two weeks — just under 5% shy of its all-time high. Bitcoin, which had spent the past week trading between $114,000 and $119,000 neared the $120,000 barrier as traders interpreted Trump’s tariff rollback as a signal of reduced macro uncertainty. “Bitcoin maintained a resilient range and rebounded to $119k after old wallets with tens of thousands of BTC began transferring funds to exchanges, which led some traders to fear a market correction,” Nassar Al Achkar, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinW, said in a Telegram note to CoinDesk. “Numerous institutions continue to onboard into the crypto industry and utilize reserve strategies, showcasing strong demand against recent surges of stock prices,” he added. Ether (ETH) rose 3.7% in 24 hours to $3,932, with momentum building ahead of the $4,000 mark in its highest price range since December. Interest in the asset has increased in the past few weeks as listed companies, such as SharpLink, set out to build ETH treasuries. Meanwhile, past market cycles typically show a period of ETH outperformance after bitcoin rallies, which may further be bouying trading demand. XRP (XRP) gained 2% to $3.30, continuing its rebound after recent volatility and ETF speculation. Among altcoins, BNB (BNB) led large-cap gains, up 6.3%, while Dogecoin (DOGE) climbed 2% to 24 cents extending its weekly rally to nearly 9%. Solana’s SOL (SOL) and Cardano’s ADA (ADA) posted modest gains, trading above $190 and 85 cents, respectively. July has marked a turning point in mainstream adoption. With public companies raising capital for crypto treasuries and banks rushing to meet demand, Jeff Mei, COO at BTSE, sees this as more than a rally, terming it a structural shift in general crypto investing strategies. “Markets have been on a tear in July — the passing of the GENIUS Act and cryptocurrencies reaching a collective $4 trillion market capitalization are important milestones for the industry,” Mei said. “We are seeing an incredible number of companies raising money on public markets to adopt crypto treasury strategies. Banks and other financial institutions are scrambling to roll out cryptocurrency-related services to meet increasing demand.” Mei added that the upcoming Fed meeting and tariff negotiations could serve as key inflection points, with an earlier-than-expected rate cut potentially fueling another leg higher for both equities and digital assets.

2025-07-28 06:06:11+00:00,"How Mutuum Finance stacks up against BTC, ETH, and SOL for summer ROI","In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced at just $0.035 in its ongoing Phase 6 presale, is setting up one of the most compelling short-term risk-to-reward ratios across the crypto sector. With a total supply of 4 billion tokens and over 14,300 holders already, MUTM offers low entry with high upside. The token is built to power a dual DeFi ecosystem with real lending utility—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P)—with returns and functionality that go beyond simple staking mechanisms. P2C and P2P lending driving real use cases Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch a powerful model for passive income through its upcoming Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system. In the near future, users will be able to deposit blue-chip assets and stablecoins—such as 0.5 BTC (valued at ~$60,000)—into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts and receive an equal amount of 60,000mtBTC. These mtTokens will represent a 1:1 claim on the original asset and are expected to generate a projected yield of up to 10.2% APY, potentially translating to $6,120 in passive income per year once the feature is live. Alongside yield generation, users will also have the ability to borrow against 1 BTC deposits without selling it. This will unlock up to 65% loan-to-value (LTV), or approximately $78,000 in USDC, while still maintaining BTC exposure. The borrowing system is being designed to offer open-ended terms, allowing for greater flexibility than traditional lending platforms. mtTokens will sit at the center of this ecosystem, powering passive income and unlocking staking opportunities as new modules roll out post-beta. MUTM rewards will eventually be distributed through a sustainable buyback model, using actual protocol revenue to reinforce token value and reward long-term participants. This is the time to invest Now in its Phase 6 presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is priced at $0.035 and has already raised over $13.6M, with more than 5% of the allocation already sold. The next phase will push the price to $0.040—a 15% increase that could arrive within days. Backed by a CertiK audit with a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 78.00, the project has taken major steps in transparency, risk management, and smart contract security. It has also launched a $50,000 bug bounty program and announced a $100,000 giveaway to 10 lucky holders, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap includes a Layer-2 integration for faster and cheaper transactions, as well as a Beta platform launch scheduled to go live when MUTM lists on the open market. These foundational utilities are set to drive organic demand and user engagement beyond the presale phase. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s P2P model adds another layer of earning power. Suppose a user lends the $10,000 TRUMP token for 60 days and sets the terms at 30% APR. The borrower accepts the conditions, and funds are locked into a risk-isolated smart contract. This isolated lending approach protects the core ecosystem while enabling high-yield returns. Terms are fully customizable, allowing participants to select duration, asset type, and interest rates—features that are rarely seen in other DeFi environments. From summer underdog to DeFi heavyweight When comparing returns, BTC’s ceiling this summer appears limited to 2x, ETH to 3x, and SOL to 4x. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is projected to rise from $0.035 in the current presale to $0.06 at launch, with analysts eyeing $0.40 by year-end and $3+ by 2026. That marks a possible 85x+ ROI in less than 18 months—a magnitude that dwarfs the expected performance of the top three cryptocurrencies. Consider the investor who bought $4,000 worth of MUTM in Phase 1 at $0.01. That position—400,000 tokens—is now worth $14,000 at the current $0.035 price and will rise to $24,000 at the $0.06 launch price. But if the token reaches $3 in 2026 as forecasted, the position grows to $1.2 million. These numbers are not speculation—they follow a structured path laid out in Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s roadmap, smart contract architecture, and token utility. Whales who have historically built positions in BTC and ETH are now rotating into Mutuum Finance (MUTM), recognizing the early-stage value in a project that blends revenue-driven tokenomics with real DeFi use cases. Phase 6 won’t stay open much longer, and with the next price set at $0.040, this is one of the final chances to enter MUTM below launch levels. For investors chasing the next wave of summer ROI, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at the front of the line.

2025-07-28 06:09:53+00:00,Phase 6 kicks off: MUTM jumps 20% while BTC consolidates near $117K,"BTC consolidation Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady around $117,000 as of July 24, 2025, following a dynamic rally to an all-time high of $123,153 on July 14. The price has settled into a consolidation phase, fluctuating between $116,000 and $119,000, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.24 billion. Institutional demand, driven by $6.6 billion in ETF inflows and MicroStrategy’s addition of 4,225 BTC ($472.5 million) to its $71 billion holdings, supports the bullish trend. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, with an RSI of 61.93, signals potential for a breakout toward $125,000-$135,000 by Q4 2025 if $119,300 clears. However, miner outflows of 16,000 BTC on July 15 and geopolitical tariff concerns suggest a possible dip to $113,500-$115,000. Bitcoin (BTC)’s resilience, backed by regulatory clarity and corporate adoption, keeps the long-term outlook strong despite short-term uncertainty. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to distinguish itself by blending blue-chip crypto assets with next-generation tokenomics to offer users both sustainable yield and long-term growth potential. Once the platform goes live, users will be able to deposit top-tier cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) into Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools and receive 1:1 mtTokens—such as mtADA—that are projected to accrue interest based on pool utilization. For example, a $10,000 ADA deposit could potentially earn a 13.5% annual percentage yield (APY), translating to around $1,350 in yearly returns. In addition to interest earnings, future users will also have the opportunity to stake their mtTokens in smart contracts to unlock extra passive income via MUTM token rewards. These rewards are expected to be funded through a sustainable revenue model where the protocol uses its earnings to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market. A key pillar of this future-ready ecosystem will be Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized stablecoin system. Users will be able to deposit ETH as collateral to mint stablecoins that are tightly pegged to $1. These stablecoins will be burned upon loan repayment, helping to regulate supply and preserve peg stability. With robust governance and built-in arbitrage incentives, this system is being designed to support deep liquidity and capital efficiency, allowing users to borrow without selling their ETH and to participate confidently in the wider DeFi economy. Presale progress and a glimpse of the future Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale currently stands at Phase 6, priced at $0.035, with about 5% of tokens sold during this phase alone. The total token supply is capped at 4 billion, with over $13.6M raised so far and an ever-growing community of 14,300+ holders. The next phase will see a price increase to $0.040, presenting an immediate opportunity for investors to capitalize on a nearly 15% jump in value. Security and transparency are key pillars of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s appeal. The project has passed a comprehensive CertiK audit with impressive scores—95 for Token Scan and 78 for Skynet—assuring investors of a solid foundation. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty incentivizes continuous security improvement across all severity levels, while a $100,000 giveaway rewards early believers with ten prizes of $10,000 worth of MUTM each, further igniting community enthusiasm and participation. To truly grasp the scale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s (MUTM) potential, consider this: an investor who swapped $12,000 worth of ETH into MUTM during Phase 1 at $0.01 per token secured 1.2 million tokens. At the current Phase 6 price of $0.035, that holding is now worth $42,000—already a 3.5× gain. But the real upside lies ahead. With post-launch projections aiming for $2, not $30, that same investment could be worth $2.4 million—a jaw-dropping 200× return. Unlike fleeting meme tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is backed by real DeFi utility, including a P2P and P2C lending model, mtToken-based staking, and a stablecoin-reward ecosystem. As adoption grows and liquidity tightens, early believers stand to gain exponentially. With Phase 6 underway and Phase 7 looming at $0.040, the window to join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at a discounted price is narrowing fast. Early investors have already benefited handsomely, and the path ahead looks even brighter. For those watching Bitcoin (BTC) and feeling the need for fresh gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a well-structured, transparent, and rewarding way to ride the next wave of DeFi innovation.

BTC consolidation Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady around $117,000 as of July 24, 2025, following a dynamic rally to an all-time high of $123,153 on July 14. The price has settled into a consolidation phase, fluctuating between $116,000 and $119,000, with a 24-hour trading volume of $2.24 billion. Institutional demand, driven by $6.6 billion in ETF inflows and MicroStrategy’s addition of 4,225 BTC ($472.5 million) to its $71 billion holdings, supports the bullish trend. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the daily chart, with an RSI of 61.93, signals potential for a breakout toward $125,000-$135,000 by Q4 2025 if $119,300 clears. However, miner outflows of 16,000 BTC on July 15 and geopolitical tariff concerns suggest a possible dip to $113,500-$115,000. Bitcoin (BTC)’s resilience, backed by regulatory clarity and corporate adoption, keeps the long-term outlook strong despite short-term uncertainty. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is set to distinguish itself by blending blue-chip crypto assets with next-generation tokenomics to offer users both sustainable yield and long-term growth potential. Once the platform goes live, users will be able to deposit top-tier cryptocurrencies like Cardano (ADA) into Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools and receive 1:1 mtTokens—such as mtADA—that are projected to accrue interest based on pool utilization. For example, a $10,000 ADA deposit could potentially earn a 13.5% annual percentage yield (APY), translating to around $1,350 in yearly returns. In addition to interest earnings, future users will also have the opportunity to stake their mtTokens in smart contracts to unlock extra passive income via MUTM token rewards. These rewards are expected to be funded through a sustainable revenue model where the protocol uses its earnings to buy back MUTM tokens on the open market. A key pillar of this future-ready ecosystem will be Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized stablecoin system. Users will be able to deposit ETH as collateral to mint stablecoins that are tightly pegged to $1. These stablecoins will be burned upon loan repayment, helping to regulate supply and preserve peg stability. With robust governance and built-in arbitrage incentives, this system is being designed to support deep liquidity and capital efficiency, allowing users to borrow without selling their ETH and to participate confidently in the wider DeFi economy. Presale progress and a glimpse of the future Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale currently stands at Phase 6, priced at $0.035, with about 5% of tokens sold during this phase alone. The total token supply is capped at 4 billion, with over $13.6M raised so far and an ever-growing community of 14,300+ holders. The next phase will see a price increase to $0.040, presenting an immediate opportunity for investors to capitalize on a nearly 15% jump in value.

Động thái đảo ngược lời hứa airdrop từ nền tảng càng khiến đợt bán tháo trở nên mạnh mẽ hơn, khiến cộng đồng đầu tư hoang mang và bắt đầu chuyển hướng. Nhưng trong tâm bão, lại hình thành một làn sóng mới – nhiều trader đang tìm đến các đồng meme coin khác không chỉ để “đu trend” mà còn kỳ vọng về tiềm năng tăng trưởng mạnh mẽ hơn, bền vững hơn. Một cách nghịch lý, cú sập của PUMP có thể chính là tín hiệu tích cực cho thị trường meme coin, khi nhiều dự án mới được định giá rẻ hơn đang bắt đầu thu hút sự chú ý. PUMP Sập – Nhưng Là Cơ Hội Cho Một Đợt Sóng Meme Coin Mới Sự lao dốc của PUMP là bài học rõ ràng cho các nhà đầu tư về rủi ro trong thị trường meme coin. Sau cú huy động hàng trăm triệu USD chỉ trong vài giây, token này đã phá vỡ mọi ngưỡng hỗ trợ, mất hơn một nửa giá trị thị trường. Biểu đồ kỹ thuật thể hiện xu hướng giảm rõ rệt ở mọi khung thời gian, và gần như không có tín hiệu phục hồi. Tuy nhiên, dữ liệu on-chain lại cho thấy hoạt động giao dịch meme coin trên nền tảng Pump.fun vẫn rất sôi động, với hàng triệu token được tạo và trao đổi mỗi ngày. Doanh thu tuy chậm lại nhưng vẫn cao hơn nhiều nền tảng Solana khác. Điều khiến nhà đầu tư mất niềm tin không đến từ công nghệ, mà là từ việc quản lý kỳ vọng quá tệ – đặc biệt là khi lời hứa airdrop bị rút lại và các vụ kiện tụng bắt đầu xuất hiện. Tuy nhiên, thị trường meme coin luôn xoay vòng rất nhanh. Khi một token thất bại, cơ hội cho token khác nổi lên cũng ngay lập tức xuất hiện. Các nhà đầu tư đã rút khỏi PUMP giờ đây đang săn lùng các đồng coin mới – có câu chuyện tốt, chưa bị dính drama, và có tiềm năng tạo sóng mới. Các Đồng Coin Tiềm Năng Sau PUMP – Lựa Chọn Nào Đáng Mua? Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Lựa Chọn Mạnh Mẽ Nhất Hiện Tại Bitcoin Hyper không phải là một meme coin thuần túy, nhưng lại kết hợp cực kỳ thông minh giữa tính nghiêm túc của một Layer 2 trên Bitcoin và sức hút của văn hóa meme. Dự án này mang đến một cách tiếp cận mới: sử dụng sức mạnh bảo mật của blockchain Bitcoin, kết hợp với tốc độ và khả năng mở rộng của Solana thông qua Solana Virtual Machine. Sau cú sốc từ PUMP, nhiều nhà đầu tư đã mất niềm tin vào các nền tảng phóng đại quá mức. Bitcoin Hyper thì ngược lại – họ cứ âm thầm xây dựng, ra mắt tính năng đúng hẹn và giữ sự năng động của cộng đồng. Với việc token đang được wrap để chạy trên Layer 2, người dùng có thể giao dịch nhanh và rẻ hơn rất nhiều so với Bitcoin gốc. Và chính sự khác biệt này – meme hóa một sản phẩm công nghệ thực sự – đang giúp HYPER trở thành cái tên nổi bật nhất sau sự sụp đổ của PUMP. Đây là một dự án vừa mang hơi hướng meme, vừa có nền tảng công nghệ thật, lại tránh được rủi ro của các nền tảng như Solana . Với tính năng staking và lộ trình DAO rõ ràng, Bitcoin Hyper chính là đại diện mạnh nhất trong nhóm các đồng coin tiềm năng hiện nay. Truy cập Bitcoin Hyper TOKEN6900: Khi Sự Giễu Cợt Trở Thành Chiến Lược TOKEN6900 bắt nguồn từ văn hóa meme nhưng không hề ngẫu hứng. Với cách xây dựng cộng đồng bài bản, nội dung hài hước nhưng đều có chủ đích, dự án đã trở thành nơi trú ẩn cho những trader từng thất vọng vì PUMP. Không whitepaper mơ hồ, không roadmap ảo – chỉ là một cộng đồng biết đùa đúng lúc và cập nhật thường xuyên. TOKEN6900 thậm chí còn tạo ra các sự kiện nhỏ, trò chơi tương tác trên Twitter để giữ độ hot. Sau khi PUMP sụp đổ, nhiều nhà đầu tư đã bắt đầu chuyển dòng vốn sang TOKEN6900 – nơi mà họ thấy được sự “điên vừa phải”, nhưng có tổ chức. Tính thanh khoản ổn định, không có hiện tượng bán tháo và có dấu hiệu hấp thụ tốt những đợt điều chỉnh. Token này đang tận dụng rất tốt làn sóng hồi phục của thị trường meme coin. Truy cập TOKEN6900 Snorter: Meme Coin Độc Đáo Trên Telegram Snorter không chạy theo mô hình ICO hay ra mắt rầm rộ. Nó tồn tại chủ yếu trên Telegram, nơi người dùng tương tác với một bot AI để nhận gợi ý giao dịch, các nội dung châm biếm, và meme độc đáo theo thời gian thực. Dự án không hứa hẹn điều gì to tát – và chính sự đơn giản, gần gũi này khiến Snorter đang nổi lên như một trong các đồng coin tiềm năng hậu-PUMP. Không phụ thuộc vào người nổi tiếng hay PR, không sợ bị kiện, không phụ thuộc airdrop – Snorter đơn giản là một cộng đồng meme coin đang dần lớn mạnh nhờ sự khác biệt. Khi sự tin tưởng với các token lớn sụp đổ, các dự án như Snorter – vừa nhỏ, vừa có cộng đồng thật, lại giữ được chất riêng – chính là lựa chọn hoàn hảo cho những ai vẫn tin vào văn hóa meme nhưng muốn một khởi đầu mới an toàn hơn. Truy cập Snorter Wall Street Pepe: Châm Biếm Tài Chính Kiểu Mỹ Wall Street Pepe không giống các dự án “ếch xanh” thông thường. Dự án này khai thác triệt để sự mỉa mai đối với giới tài chính Phố Wall, tạo ra một nhân vật Pepe “quý tộc” với phong cách châm biếm đặc trưng. Sự nổi lên của token này gắn liền với các chiến dịch truyền thông hài hước, các đợt phát hành được lên kế hoạch kỹ càng và cộng đồng trung thà",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/top-potential-meme-coins-after-pump-crash-vn/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA,Uncategorized,BTC,"Các Đồng Coin Tiềm Năng Nổi Bật Sau Khi PUMP Giảm Mạnh Khiến Nhà Đầu Tư Đứng Ngồi Không Yên.

Điều khiến nhà đầu tư mất niềm tin không đến từ công nghệ, mà là từ việc quản lý kỳ vọng quá tệ – đặc biệt là khi lời hứa airdrop bị rút lại và các vụ kiện tụng bắt đầu xuất hiện. Tuy nhiên, thị trường meme coin luôn xoay vòng rất nhanh. Khi một token thất bại, cơ hội cho token khác nổi lên cũng ngay lập tức xuất hiện. Các nhà đầu tư đã rút khỏi PUMP giờ đây đang săn lùng các đồng coin mới – có câu chuyện tốt, chưa bị dính drama, và có tiềm năng tạo sóng mới. Các Đồng Coin Tiềm Năng Sau PUMP – Lựa Chọn Nào Đáng Mua? Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Lựa Chọn Mạnh Mẽ Nhất Hiện Tại Bitcoin Hyper không phải là một meme coin thuần túy, nhưng lại kết hợp cực kỳ thông minh giữa tính nghiêm túc của một Layer 2 trên Bitcoin và sức hút của văn hóa meme. Dự án này mang đến một cách tiếp cận mới: sử dụng sức mạnh bảo mật của blockchain Bitcoin, kết hợp với tốc độ và khả năng mở rộng của Solana thông qua Solana Virtual Machine. Sau cú sốc từ PUMP, nhiều nhà đầu tư đã mất niềm tin vào các nền tảng phóng đại quá mức. Bitcoin Hyper thì ngược lại – họ cứ âm thầm xây dựng, ra mắt tính năng đúng hẹn và giữ sự năng động của cộng đồng. Với việc token đang được wrap để chạy trên Layer 2, người dùng có thể giao dịch nhanh và rẻ hơn rất nhiều so với Bitcoin gốc. Và chính sự khác biệt này – meme hóa một sản phẩm công nghệ thực sự – đang giúp HYPER trở thành cái tên nổi bật nhất sau sự sụp đổ của PUMP. Đây là một dự án vừa mang hơi hướng meme, vừa có nền tảng công nghệ thật, lại tránh được rủi ro của các nền tảng như Solana . Với tính năng staking và lộ trình DAO rõ ràng, Bitcoin Hyper chính là đại diện mạnh nhất trong nhóm các đồng coin tiềm năng hiện nay. Truy cập Bitcoin Hyper TOKEN6900: Khi Sự Giễu Cợt Trở Thành Chiến Lược TOKEN6900 bắt nguồn từ văn hóa meme nhưng không hề ngẫu hứng. Với cách xây dựng cộng đồng bài bản, nội dung hài hước nhưng đều có chủ đích, dự án đã trở thành nơi trú ẩn cho những trader từng thất vọng vì PUMP. Không whitepaper mơ hồ, không roadmap ảo – chỉ là một cộng đồng biết đùa đúng lúc và cập nhật thường xuyên. TOKEN6900 thậm chí còn tạo ra các sự kiện nhỏ, trò chơi tương tác trên Twitter để giữ độ hot. Sau khi PUMP sụp đổ, nhiều nhà đầu tư đã bắt đầu chuyển dòng vốn sang TOKEN6900 – nơi mà họ thấy được sự “điên vừa phải”, nhưng có tổ chức. Tính thanh khoản ổn định, không có hiện tượng bán tháo và có dấu hiệu hấp thụ tốt những đợt điều chỉnh. Token này đang tận dụng rất tốt làn sóng hồi phục của thị trường meme coin. Truy cập TOKEN6900 Snorter: Meme Coin Độc Đáo Trên Telegram Snorter không chạy theo mô hình ICO hay ra mắt rầm rộ. Nó tồn tại chủ yếu trên Telegram, nơi người dùng tương tác với một bot AI để nhận gợi ý giao dịch, các nội dung châm biếm, và meme độc đáo theo thời gian thực. Dự án không hứa hẹn điều gì to tát – và chính sự đơn giản, gần gũi này khiến Snorter đang nổi lên như một trong các đồng coin tiềm năng hậu-PUMP. Không phụ thuộc vào người nổi tiếng hay PR, không sợ bị kiện, không phụ thuộc airdrop – Snorter đơn giản là một cộng đồng meme coin đang dần lớn mạnh nhờ sự khác biệt. Khi sự tin tưởng với các token lớn sụp đổ, các dự án như Snorter – vừa nhỏ, vừa có cộng đồng thật, lại giữ được chất riêng – chính là lựa chọn hoàn hảo cho những ai vẫn tin vào văn hóa meme nhưng muốn một khởi đầu mới an toàn hơn. Truy cập Snorter Wall Street Pepe: Châm Biếm Tài Chính Kiểu Mỹ Wall Street Pepe không giống các dự án “ếch xanh” thông thường. Dự án này khai thác triệt để sự mỉa mai đối với giới tài chính Phố Wall, tạo ra một nhân vật Pepe “quý tộc” với phong cách châm biếm đặc trưng. Sự nổi lên của token này gắn liền với các chiến dịch truyền thông hài hước, các đợt phát hành được lên kế hoạch kỹ càng và cộng đồng trung thà"

2025-07-28 06:25:11+00:00,Unveiling the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio: A Crucial Market Indicator,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio: A Crucial Market Indicator In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, understanding market sentiment is paramount. For those navigating the volatile waters of derivatives, especially Bitcoin perpetual futures, knowing whether the majority of traders are leaning ‘long’ (betting on price increases) or ‘short’ (betting on price decreases) can provide invaluable insights. This is where the Bitcoin long-short ratio comes into play, acting as a powerful lens through which to view collective trader psychology and potential future price movements. What Exactly Are BTC Perpetual Futures? Before diving deep into the Bitcoin long-short ratio , it’s essential to grasp the instrument it relates to: Bitcoin perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have a fixed expiry date, perpetual futures do not. They are derivatives contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without owning the underlying asset. This unique feature, combined with a mechanism called ‘funding rates’ that helps keep the perpetual futures price tethered to the spot price, makes them incredibly popular among crypto traders. No Expiry: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. Leverage: Perpetual futures often offer high leverage, amplifying potential gains (and losses). Funding Rates: A small fee exchanged between long and short positions, typically every eight hours, to ensure the perpetual contract price stays close to the spot price. Positive funding rates indicate more longs paying shorts, while negative rates mean shorts pay longs. Liquidity: These markets are highly liquid, allowing for large trades without significant price impact. Their flexibility and leverage make BTC perpetual futures a cornerstone of speculative trading, and thus, understanding the sentiment within these markets becomes a critical component of any comprehensive trading strategy. Decoding the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio The Bitcoin long-short ratio is a metric that compares the total number of long positions to the total number of short positions on a given exchange or across multiple exchanges for a specific asset, in this case, BTC perpetual futures. It’s often expressed as a percentage or a simple ratio (e.g., 1.2, meaning 1.2 long positions for every 1 short position). Here’s what the ratio fundamentally tells us: Ratio > 1 (or Long % > Short %): Indicates that more traders are betting on Bitcoin’s price to rise. This suggests a bullish sentiment among the derivatives traders. Ratio Suggests that more traders anticipate Bitcoin’s price to fall. This points to a bearish sentiment. Ratio = 1 (or Long % ≈ Short %): Signifies a relatively balanced market sentiment, with an equal number of traders expecting price increases and decreases. This ratio is a powerful sentiment indicator because it reflects the actual positions taken by traders with real capital at stake. It’s not just an opinion poll; it’s a direct measure of market participants’ conviction. Analyzing the Latest 24-Hour Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Data Let’s examine the recent 24-hour Bitcoin long-short ratio data for BTC perpetual futures across key cryptocurrency exchanges. This snapshot provides immediate insight into current market sentiment. 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Exchange/Total Long Positions (%) Short Positions (%) Total Market 51.11% 48.89% Binance 51.42% 48.58% Bybit 51.65% 48.89% Gate.io 50.15% 49.85% As you can see from the aggregated data, the overall market shows a slight leaning towards long positions, with 51.11% of traders betting on an increase versus 48.89% betting on a decrease. This indicates a marginally bullish sentiment in the perpetual futures market over the past day. Individually, Binance and Bybit show a slightly stronger bullish bias, while Gate.io’s ratio is nearly balanced, reflecting a more neutral stance among its user base. Why Do Exchange Ratios Differ Slightly? It’s common to observe slight variations in the Bitcoin long-short ratio across different exchanges. Several factors contribute to these discrepancies: User Base Demographics: Each exchange attracts a slightly different cohort of traders. Some might be favored by institutional players, others by retail traders, or those in specific geographic regions, each with their own collective biases and strategies. Liquidity and Trading Volume: Exchanges with higher liquidity and trading volumes might present a more accurate reflection of the broader market sentiment, as they encompass a larger sample size of traders. Smaller exchanges might show more volatile or idiosyncratic ratios. Funding Rate Mechanisms: While generally similar, subtle differences in how funding rates are calculated or applied can influence trader behavior and position-taking on different platforms.

Therefore, for crypto traders, it is really important to keep an eye on every US economic development. In the previous week, the US market experienced a rise of 1.21%. Even though, at one point in the week, the market slipped to a low of $6,284.37, at the time of closing, it had raised to $6,388.64. During the same period, the crypto market saw a drop of around 1.66%. This week is expected to be an eventful week for the US market. Here are the key events crypto traders should watch for. Major US Economic Indicators to Watch This Week 1. FOMC Meeting – July 29–30, 2025 The upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting will conclude on July 30, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell scheduled to deliver a press conference shortly thereafter. Market Expectation: Interest rates are expected to remain steady at 4.25%–4.50% . Key Considerations Inflation has accelerated for the second consecutive month, reaching 2.7% in June. Initial jobless claims declined from 221,000 to 217,000, marking the second drop this month. Potential Crypto Market Impact : If the Fed maintains its data-dependent stance and signals no immediate cuts, cryptocurrencies may experience muted upward movement. However, continued inflation pressures could reinforce crypto’s appeal as a hedge against currency debasement. 2. Advance Estimate of Q2 GDP – July 30, 2025 The advance estimate for US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the second quarter will also be released on July 30. Previous (Q1 2025): -0.5% Consensus (Q2 2025): +2.5% Potential Crypto Market Impact : A robust GDP rebound could dampen expectations of near-term Fed easing, which may temporarily limit crypto upside. Conversely, it could also reduce recessionary fears and support broader risk appetite, including in digital assets. 3. Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Rate – August 1, 2025 The July employment report, including Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) and the Unemployment Rate, is scheduled for release on August 1. June NFP: 147,000 Consensus for July: 102,000 June Unemployment Rate: 4.1% Consensus for July: 4.2% Potential Crypto Market Impact : Weaker job growth and a modest uptick in unemployment could reinforce expectations of monetary easing later this year. Historically, such conditions have supported inflows into risk assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as investors reposition for lower real yields. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Is Crypto Market Going Up Today?

Key Takeaways: Neutral-to-hawkish Fed stance may temporarily cap crypto gains. Stronger-than-expected GDP could pressure digital asset valuations.

2025-07-28 06:40:10+00:00,Trump Media Bitcoin Investment: Unveiling a Bold $300M Strategic Move,"BitcoinWorld Trump Media Bitcoin Investment: Unveiling a Bold $300M Strategic Move Imagine a traditional media giant, deeply rooted in political and public discourse, suddenly making a massive leap into the volatile world of digital assets. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s the groundbreaking reality of the Trump Media Bitcoin Investment . The news, as reported by Bloomberg, reveals that Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the media company associated with the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has committed a staggering $300 million to Bitcoin-related options. This audacious move marks a significant moment, not just for TMTG, but for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, signaling a new frontier for corporate treasury strategies and market engagement. What’s Behind the Trump Media Bitcoin Investment? The decision by TMTG to pour hundreds of millions into Bitcoin-linked options raises compelling questions about their strategic vision and understanding of the evolving financial world. Historically, media companies are not typically at the forefront of aggressive digital asset speculation. This bold step suggests a deliberate shift in TMTG’s investment philosophy, moving beyond traditional revenue streams to embrace the potential profitability offered by the crypto market’s inherent dynamism. While specific details of the investment remain undisclosed, the core intention is clear: to leverage Bitcoin’s price fluctuations for profit. This isn’t about simply holding Bitcoin as a long-term asset; it’s about actively engaging with its volatility. Bitcoin-related options grant TMTG the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price by a certain date. This strategy allows for significant exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the need for direct, outright ownership of the underlying asset. It’s a sophisticated play, often employed by experienced traders and institutional investors looking to capitalize on market swings, whether upward or downward. For TMTG, this Trump Media Bitcoin Investment is a clear signal of their intent to innovate their financial operations and potentially diversify their revenue streams in an unconventional manner. Decoding TMTG’s Strategy: Navigating Bitcoin’s Volatility TMTG’s investment in Bitcoin-linked options is a testament to a strategy focused on harnessing market volatility, rather than shying away from it. This approach is fundamentally different from a company simply adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet as a reserve asset, as seen with MicroStrategy. Instead, TMTG appears to be positioning itself to generate returns from the ebb and flow of Bitcoin’s price. Let’s break down what this means: Leveraging Price Swings: Options contracts derive their value from the underlying asset’s price movements. By buying or selling calls (right to buy) or puts (right to sell), TMTG can profit if Bitcoin’s price moves in a favorable direction relative to their options positions. Capitalizing on Volatility: The very nature of options makes them attractive in volatile markets. Higher volatility generally means higher options premiums, but also greater potential for significant gains if the market moves as anticipated. TMTG’s strategy aims to exploit these rapid changes. Risk Management (and Exposure): While options can limit downside risk compared to direct ownership in some scenarios, they are inherently complex and carry their own set of risks. A wrong bet on market direction or an unexpected lack of volatility could lead to substantial losses on the $300 million investment. This strategy requires sophisticated market analysis and timing. Active Management: Unlike passive holding, an options strategy demands active management and continuous monitoring of market conditions. This suggests TMTG is either building internal expertise or leveraging external financial advisors specializing in digital asset derivatives. This calculated engagement with Bitcoin’s price action through options underscores a belief within TMTG that significant value can be extracted from the cryptocurrency market’s dynamic nature. It’s a bold move that could set a precedent for other non-traditional companies eyeing the digital asset space, making the Trump Media Bitcoin Investment a case study in modern corporate finance. The Broader Impact: How Does This Affect the Crypto Landscape? The entry of a high-profile entity like Trump Media & Technology Group into the Bitcoin options market has ripple effects that extend far beyond its own balance sheet.

BitcoinWorld Trump Media Bitcoin Investment: Unveiling a Bold $300M Strategic Move Imagine a traditional media giant, deeply rooted in political and public discourse, suddenly making a massive leap into the volatile world of digital assets. This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s the groundbreaking reality of the Trump Media Bitcoin Investment . The news, as reported by Bloomberg, reveals that Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the media company associated with the family of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has committed a staggering $300 million to Bitcoin-related options. This audacious move marks a significant moment, not just for TMTG, but for the broader cryptocurrency landscape, signaling a new frontier for corporate treasury strategies and market engagement. What’s Behind the Trump Media Bitcoin Investment? The decision by TMTG to pour hundreds of millions into Bitcoin-linked options raises compelling questions about their strategic vision and understanding of the evolving financial world. Historically, media companies are not typically at the forefront of aggressive digital asset speculation. This bold step suggests a deliberate shift in TMTG’s investment philosophy, moving beyond traditional revenue streams to embrace the potential profitability offered by the crypto market’s inherent dynamism. While specific details of the investment remain undisclosed, the core intention is clear: to leverage Bitcoin’s price fluctuations for profit. This isn’t about simply holding Bitcoin as a long-term asset; it’s about actively engaging with its volatility. Bitcoin-related options grant TMTG the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price by a certain date. This strategy allows for significant exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the need for direct, outright ownership of the underlying asset. It’s a sophisticated play, often employed by experienced traders and institutional investors looking to capitalize on market swings, whether upward or downward. For TMTG, this Trump Media Bitcoin Investment is a clear signal of their intent to innovate their financial operations and potentially diversify their revenue streams in an unconventional manner.

This development is particularly noteworthy given their progressive stance on accepting Bitcoin payment , positioning them at the forefront of innovation in the digital economy. The company successfully raised approximately £19.68 million ($26.42 million) through the placement of 6,057,914 new ordinary shares, part of a larger tranche of 14 million. This influx of capital is not just a financial milestone; it’s a strong signal about the increasing confidence in companies that embrace decentralized technologies and digital currencies. What Does This Massive Funding Mean for The Smarter Web Company? The successful capital raise of $26.42 million represents a pivotal moment for The Smarter Web Company. This substantial funding injection is set to accelerate the company’s strategic initiatives, deepen its technological capabilities, and expand its market reach. For a tech firm operating in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, access to significant capital is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and fostering innovation. Specifically, this funding is expected to: Fuel Research and Development: Invest in cutting-edge technologies and platforms, enhancing their core offerings and exploring new opportunities within the web and digital services domain. Expand Global Operations: Support the company’s ambitious growth plans, potentially opening new offices or expanding services into new geographical markets, leveraging their existing infrastructure that supports Bitcoin payment . Strengthen Talent Pool: Attract and retain top-tier talent in engineering, cybersecurity, and blockchain development, ensuring they remain at the forefront of technological advancement. Enhance Product Portfolio: Develop new products and services, or significantly improve existing ones, to meet the evolving demands of their client base, which includes those who prefer Bitcoin payment options. This financial backing not only provides the necessary resources for growth but also serves as a strong vote of confidence from investors in the company’s business model and its forward-thinking approach to digital payments. Why is Bitcoin Payment Acceptance a Game-Changer for Traditional Firms? The Smarter Web Company’s continued acceptance of Bitcoin payment methods is more than just a convenience; it’s a strategic decision that reflects a profound understanding of the future of finance and commerce. While cryptocurrencies have long been associated with niche markets, their gradual integration into mainstream business operations by London-listed firms like this signifies a broader shift. Embracing Bitcoin and other digital assets offers several compelling advantages: Global Reach and Reduced Fees: Traditional cross-border transactions often involve multiple intermediaries, leading to high fees and slow settlement times. Bitcoin payment , on the other hand, allows for near-instantaneous, borderless transactions with significantly lower costs, opening up new customer segments globally. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Blockchain technology, which underpins Bitcoin, offers a high level of cryptographic security and transparency. While volatility remains a concern, the underlying technology provides a robust framework for secure transactions. Attracting a New Demographic: A growing segment of the population, particularly younger generations and tech-savvy individuals, prefers or even exclusively uses cryptocurrencies. By accepting Bitcoin, companies can tap into this expanding market. Innovation and Competitive Edge: Early adoption of emerging technologies like crypto payments can position a company as an innovator, setting it apart from competitors and signaling a forward-looking vision to investors and customers alike. However, it’s also important to acknowledge the challenges. Volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and the need for robust security infrastructure are significant considerations.

Currently, the pioneer cryptocurrency looks to be on the path of recovery and possibly moving toward new highs this week as momentum picks up. There is also the possibility of a coming short squeeze, as explained by crypto analyst Luca on X, using recent developments that show that the recent crash may have only been temporary. Bitcoin Shows Tendency To Cross $123,000 Again In an X post, Luca pointed to the Bitcoin market makers as the ones behind the recent price movements and that there was a reason for this. The initial move downward looked to be an attempt to flush out late longs as crypto traders tried to take advantage of the frenzy created by the new all-time highs. Related Reading: Ripple CEO Sounds Alarm: If You’re An XRP Investor, You Should See This Then a reversal moved into the works, catching shorters unaware and sweeping liquidity at support levels. This comes as bears were pulled into a false sense of security, believing that the price would continue to decline before being hit with the move back up above $118,000, triggering hundreds of millions of dollars in liquidations. All of this is happening at a time when things like the Bitcoin funding rate were falling. Coinglass data shows the Bitcoin OI-Weighted Funding Rate had fallen briefly below 0.01% on Sunday after reaching as high as 0.0167% earlier in the week on July 23. Luca further revealed that the Bitcoin Premium metric had also fallen back into the negative. Another interesting fact was the fact that the open interest had shot up when the Bitcoin price had declined. Then, once the price began to recover, the open interest began to rise once again, and Luca interprets this as short positions starting to get squeezed. If this squeeze continues, then the Bitcoin price could spike very quickly, taking out tens of thousands of short positions with it.

2025-07-28 07:04:32+00:00,JPMorgan Chase Warns ‘Shadows of 2007’ Brewing Amid Meme Stock Mania – Why the Bank Is Staying Bullish,"Banking giant JPMorgan Chase warns that a maturing market could pose a systemic risk capable of triggering a meltdown reminiscent of the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. In a new interview on CNBC, Bill Eigen, the CIO of JPMorgan Asset Management’s absolute fixed income division, says there’s a speculative fever spreading throughout markets, as evidenced by the hot crypto and meme stock markets. He also warns that the private credit market looks to be following in the footsteps of subprime mortgage-backed securities (MBS) over 20 years ago. Subprime MBS are stacked with housing loans given to high-risk borrowers with poor credit and were marked safe by credit ratings agencies, allowing institutions to invest heavily in the asset class. When the borrowers started to default en masse, MBS prices collapsed and institutions with billions of dollars in exposure imploded. Eigen sees a similar pattern repeating in the private credit market. The JPMorgan executive says private credit, or loans given by non-bank lenders such as hedge funds to riskier borrowers like small companies, are highly illiquid assets that are hard to sell because they don’t trade in the public markets. He notes that there’s now a “big push” for these assets to be sold in public vehicles that would expose institutions to stacks of loans given to riskier borrowers. “Boy, you know what, I’m getting shadows of ’07 a little bit. Not to the extent of back then, but the thing I’m nervous about is that there’s this big push to put private assets in mutual funds, ETFs (exchange-traded funds) and things like that – things that trade by appointment and putting them in vehicles that trade by the second. Whenever I start to see things like that, I just personally get a little bit nervous… This huge push to take illiquid assets and [make them liquid or semi-liquid]. Some of these things trade by appointment, there’s a lot private credit out there that should not be trading at par value but that’s where it’s marked… You remember what happened back in the day, the ABX index (subprime MBS) and taking illiquid mortgages and putting them in liquid vehicles and the rest is history.” But for now, JPMorgan Chase is staying bullish on the stock market, noting that the Trump administration is doing everything it can to “turbocharge” the economy and get equities higher.

2025-07-28 07:08:00+00:00,Trump Media Invests $300M on Options Tied to Bitcoin-Related Securities: Report,"Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company behind Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has made a $300 million investment in options linked to Bitcoin-related securities. Key Takeaways: Trump Media has invested $300M in options tied to Bitcoin-related assets. The strategy aims to profit from crypto price swings without holding Bitcoin directly. Timing is crucial, as options offer high reward but carry significant risk. While specific details of the investment remain limited, the move signals a shift in strategy as Trump Media appears to be positioning itself to benefit from fluctuations in Bitcoin prices, according to a Bloomberg report . The company, which is closely tied to Trump’s public presence, may be seeking to amplify its market exposure by leveraging price volatility through derivatives rather than holding the digital asset directly. Timing Is Everything in Trump Media’s Bitcoin Options Bet Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, noted the timing of this strategy is critical. “It adds a timing and price element that doesn’t exist if you just own the underlying asset,” he said, pointing out that options allow for higher potential returns, but with increased risk. Bitcoin-linked securities can include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), shares in crypto firms, or convertible notes from companies like MicroStrategy. Options tied to these assets offer leveraged exposure, but if the strike price isn’t reached before expiry, they can become worthless. TMTG declined to comment. A White House spokesperson told Bloomberg that the president “has never engaged in, and never will engage in, any conflict of interest.” The decision may also tie into Trump’s personal influence over crypto markets. His posts on Truth Social have previously driven price surges. In March, a post claiming the US should consider a reserve asset composed of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum coincided with a jump in digital asset prices. TMTG’s crypto exposure isn’t new. The company already holds an estimated $2 billion in Bitcoin and related assets, but actively trading options marks a rare approach among public firms. The strategy opens up the possibility of generating profits during sharp price swings while exposing the firm to potentially large losses if the market moves the other way. Trump Media raises $2.44B for a corporate Bitcoin treasury, positioning itself among the top global corporate BTC holders. #Bitcoin #TrumpMedia https://t.co/1ZgY78WNTN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 Trump’s Crypto Holdings Make Up Key Portion of His Fortune Trump’s crypto-linked holdings are also a substantial part of his personal wealth . Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index estimates that TMTG stock represents $2.2 billion of Trump’s $6.6 billion fortune. His broader cryptocurrency investments are believed to have gained at least $620 million in recent months. However, the move is raising concerns among some industry figures. Nick Carter, general partner at Castle Island Ventures and a Trump supporter, said the overlap between Trump’s political influence and his financial exposure to crypto markets could create a conflict of interest. “It’s always a headache to have businesses with conflicting interests,” he told Bloomberg. As reported, nearly 70 nominees and officials in the Trump administration reportedly hold crypto or investments in blockchain companies , with holdings ranging from modest sums to over $120 million. The group includes Vice President JD Vance and seven Cabinet members or nominees, who collectively disclosed at least $2 million in crypto assets. Critics warn that this creates potential conflicts of interest and normalizes risky crypto investments among public servants.

Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the company behind Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has made a $300 million investment in options linked to Bitcoin-related securities. Key Takeaways: Trump Media has invested $300M in options tied to Bitcoin-related assets. The strategy aims to profit from crypto price swings without holding Bitcoin directly. Timing is crucial, as options offer high reward but carry significant risk. While specific details of the investment remain limited, the move signals a shift in strategy as Trump Media appears to be positioning itself to benefit from fluctuations in Bitcoin prices, according to a Bloomberg report . The company, which is closely tied to Trump’s public presence, may be seeking to amplify its market exposure by leveraging price volatility through derivatives rather than holding the digital asset directly. Timing Is Everything in Trump Media’s Bitcoin Options Bet Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, noted the timing of this strategy is critical. “It adds a timing and price element that doesn’t exist if you just own the underlying asset,” he said, pointing out that options allow for higher potential returns, but with increased risk. Bitcoin-linked securities can include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), shares in crypto firms, or convertible notes from companies like MicroStrategy. Options tied to these assets offer leveraged exposure, but if the strike price isn’t reached before expiry, they can become worthless. TMTG declined to comment. A White House spokesperson told Bloomberg that the president “has never engaged in, and never will engage in, any conflict of interest.” The decision may also tie into Trump’s personal influence over crypto markets. His posts on Truth Social have previously driven price surges. In March, a post claiming the US should consider a reserve asset composed of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin and Ethereum coincided with a jump in digital asset prices. TMTG’s crypto exposure isn’t new. The company already holds an estimated $2 billion in Bitcoin and related assets, but actively trading options marks a rare approach among public firms. The strategy opens up the possibility of generating profits during sharp price swings while exposing the firm to potentially large losses if the market moves the other way. Trump Media raises $2.44B for a corporate Bitcoin treasury, positioning itself among the top global corporate BTC holders. #Bitcoin #TrumpMedia https://t.co/1ZgY78WNTN — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 30, 2025 Trump’s Crypto Holdings Make Up Key Portion of His Fortune Trump’s crypto-linked holdings are also a substantial part of his personal wealth .

2025-07-28 07:23:24+00:00,Here is the Bitcoin Price Level That Could be an Attractive Entry Point for BTC Bulls,"As bitcoin (BTC) holds near its record highs, traders looking to join the uptrend may be facing a dilemma: should they enter now, or wait for a more favorable pullback? According to Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , a pullback to the former resistance-turned-support level of the May high, under $112,000, would be the best entry point. ""We would prefer to see bitcoin retest its $111,673 breakout level to provide a more favorable risk/reward entry point,"" Thielen said in a note to clients Monday. The risk-reward ratio compares the potential loss of an investment to its potential profit, helping traders determine whether the potential gains justify the associated risks. Traders typically target a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2, necessitating bullish entries close to key support levels, like the $111,673 in BTC''s case. It''s common for markets to revisit the breakout points before staging bigger bull runs, meaning a potential pullback to $111,673 cannot be ruled out. As of writing, BTC traded flat at around $119,500, having risen over 1% on Sunday amid reports that the U.S. had reached the largest-ever trade deal with the European Union. But what if the meaningful pullback doesn''t unfold? In that case, the best entry would be above $120,000, marking a breakout above the trendline connecting July 14 and July 23 highs. ""A break above the descending trendline, particularly a sustained move above $120,000, could justify re-engaging with the trend, though it would warrant unusually tight stop-losses,"" Thielen said.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/28/here-is-the-bitcoin-price-level-that-could-be-an-attractive-entry-point-for-btc-bulls,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ZRX|BUSINESS,Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|News,BTC,"Here is the Bitcoin Price Level That Could be an Attractive Entry Point for BTC Bulls.

2025-07-28 07:30:10+00:00,Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Fuels H100 Group’s Astounding $11.46M Funding Success,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Fuels H100 Group’s Astounding $11.46M Funding Success In the dynamic world where cutting-edge technology meets strategic finance, the H100 Group, a prominent Swedish health-tech firm, has made headlines with its latest funding announcement. The company recently completed a directed share issue, successfully raising approximately SEK 109.19 million, equivalent to a remarkable $11.46 million. What makes this achievement particularly compelling for the crypto community is H100 Group’s pioneering adoption of a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy , a move that has significantly shaped its financial trajectory. Unpacking H100 Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Treasury Strategy For those new to the concept, a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy involves a company holding Bitcoin as a reserve asset on its balance sheet, much like it would traditional fiat currencies or gold. This strategic shift is gaining traction among forward-thinking corporations looking to diversify their assets, hedge against inflation, and align with the burgeoning digital economy. H100 Group has not just dipped its toes but has fully embraced this innovative approach, demonstrating a profound belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. The decision to implement a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy is often driven by several factors: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s finite supply makes it an attractive hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the treasury can reduce overall portfolio risk. Innovation Alignment: For tech companies, embracing digital assets signals a commitment to innovation and future-forward thinking. Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term growth potential. H100 Group’s commitment to this strategy highlights a growing trend where companies are not just observing the crypto space but actively participating in it, integrating digital assets into their core financial operations. The Astounding $11.46 Million Funding Round: A Testament to Vision? The recent share issue, announced by H100 Group on X (formerly Twitter), represents a significant milestone. Raising $11.46 million in a single round is impressive for any firm, but for one openly leveraging a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy , it sends a powerful message to both traditional investors and the crypto market. This latest funding round brings H100 Group’s total gross proceeds since launching its Bitcoin Treasury Strategy to approximately SEK 1.095 billion, which translates to a staggering $114 million. This cumulative figure underscores the substantial financial growth and investor confidence the company has garnered through its unconventional yet strategic financial management. What does this mean for H100 Group? This fresh capital infusion will undoubtedly fuel their health-tech innovations, enabling them to expand their research and development, scale their operations, and reach a broader market. It validates their strategic financial decisions and positions them as a leader not just in health-tech but also in corporate financial innovation. Why are More Companies Adopting a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy? H100 Group is not alone in its embrace of Bitcoin. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have famously adopted similar strategies, albeit on different scales. The rationale behind this trend is multifaceted: Benefit Description Potential Impact Inflation Hedge Protection against purchasing power erosion of fiat currencies. Preserves capital value over time. Balance Sheet Diversification Adding a non-traditional asset to reduce overall portfolio risk. Improved risk-adjusted returns. Innovation & Future-Proofing Signaling adaptability and forward-thinking in a digital age. Attracts tech-savvy talent and investors. Potential for Appreciation Exposure to a high-growth asset class. Significant capital gains if Bitcoin’s value increases. However, adopting a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy is not without its challenges. The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, regulatory uncertainties, and the need for robust security protocols are significant considerations. Companies must conduct thorough due diligence and implement sophisticated risk management frameworks to navigate these complexities effectively.

2025-07-28 07:41:26+00:00,2025’s Best Premium Cloud Mining Providers: Earn Reliable Passive Income from Cryptocurrency,"Written by: Blockchain investment researcher / Crypto asset observer Introduction: Beyond Trading, “Hash Power” Emerges as the New Force in the Crypto Market In 2025, Bitcoin’s price surged past $128,000. With the implementation of the MiCA regulations in Europe and the inclusion of digital assets in U.S. pension plans (like 401(k)s), the market is entering a new phase of compliance and mainstream adoption. Traditional investment strategies—often driven by speculation and volatility—are falling out of favor. Instead, investors are increasingly turning toward more stable, secure, and long-term income-generating methods. At this point, cloud mining has emerged as a new gateway for mainstream asset allocation. Users don’t need to purchase mining machines or handle technical setups. Instead, by renting computing power from a compliant platform, they can remotely participate in cryptocurrency mining and earn real daily returns. Especially those platforms that combine AI-based allocation and green energy are becoming the top choice for building reliable “digital cash flows.” What Is Cloud Mining? How Can You Earn Crypto on Your Phone Through It? Cloud mining is a method of cryptocurrency mining that doesn’t require users to purchase or manage mining hardware themselves. Instead, it leases computing power from large-scale mining farms through online contracts. Users simply select a mining plan online and can remotely mine major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic, or Litecoin—receiving daily payouts. Compared to traditional local mining, cloud mining’s biggest advantage is that it eliminates the need for any hardware purchases, electricity costs, or technical maintenance. Today, many mainstream cloud mining platforms (such as MiningToken ) offer dedicated mobile apps, allowing users to register, choose a contract, track earnings in real time, and even withdraw automatically—making it truly possible to “earn crypto from your phone.” Advantages of Cloud Mining: Zero Hardware Costs – Start Mining from Your Phone: No need for mining rigs, electricity setups, or wiring. Simply register an account to start mining with one click. Low Barrier to Entry – No Technical Knowledge Required: Even beginners without blockchain or programming experience can get started easily. Daily Automatic Earnings: Platforms calculate daily mining rewards based on contracts and support mainstream cryptocurrencies such as BTC, USDT, and ETC, with real-time payout. Short-Term Contracts with Flexible Exit Options: Many platforms offer short contracts (1, 3, or 5 days), making it easy to test the waters or adjust strategies without locking up funds long-term. Powered by Green Energy and AI: Leading platforms often integrate AI-based computing allocation with renewable energy sources (like hydropower and geothermal), maximizing profitability while remaining environmentally friendly. In Summary: Cloud mining offers a device-free, low-maintenance way to invest in cryptocurrencies with controllable returns. Especially at the beginning of a bull market and under clear regulatory conditions, choosing a legal and transparent platform can be a key step in building a stream of passive crypto income. MiningToken — Swiss-Based, AI Optimization + Clean Energy Integration MiningToken has become one of the top-performing cloud mining platforms in 2025. Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, it complies with local financial and energy regulations. The platform uses an AI-powered computing allocation system to identify the most profitable cryptocurrencies at any given time (e.g., BTC, ETC, DOGE), helping users maximize daily returns. All mining operations are powered by renewable energy sources, such as geothermal power in Iceland and hydropower in Norway. Users can choose short-term flexible contracts ranging from 1 to 5 days, which are ideal for quick returns and low-entry strategies. MiningToken also supports multi-coin mining and automatic reward conversion, making it an excellent starting point for building a passive income portfolio.

2025-07-28 07:53:12+00:00,XRP Army Under Attack: 4 Reasons Scammers Keep Coming at Ripple,"TL;DR The growth of the cryptocurrency market resulted in a skyrocketing number of scam attempts, many of which are highly successful for the bad actors. Ripple’s ecosystem is among the most targeted, and here are some of the possible reasons behind this. Brief Scam History and Recent Targets Cryptocurrency scams are nothing new, they have been employed by fraudsters for years. However, they tend to pick up in times when the market is going through the roof, as has been the case for the past several months. In general, the more attention people pay to crypto, the more it is expected that bad actors will search for victims. Arguably, the most utilized type of scam involves offering to double someone’s tokens by sending a certain amount to an address. As expected, the sender never receives the promised profit, nor even their initial funds. Of course, there are others, like Ponzi schemes, pump-and-dumps, and rug pulls, but the ones we will focus on in this article do not fall under that category, as they use an already established and well-known brand or a public figure to impersonate them and lure victims in. Throughout the years, many crypto projects and their communities have been targeted, with scams ranging from hacked Twitter accounts (at the time) promising free BTC to deep fakes of prominent figures such as Elon Musk, Charles Hoskinson, Changpeng Zhao, and Brad Garlinghouse. The last one, in fact, issued a vital warning for Ripple, its investors, and its community, earlier this month. Scammers used YouTube as their main platform to impersonate Ripple’s official account and executives to promote various frauds. XRP Army Under Attack: Why So? One of the possible reasons behind the scam attacks against Ripple and its community is its size – it’s one of the most vocal parts of the entire cryptocurrency space, while the native token has been in the top 10 and 5 digital assets for years. Currently, it’s the third-largest, with a market cap of close to $200 billion. This makes it a prime candidate to be exploited by bad actors. XRP holders are frequently expecting big news, such as partnership announcements with large banks, impactful updates like the ISO 20022 , spot ETF approvals in the States, or new developments on the legal case against the SEC, which started well over four years ago. This also opens the door for creative scams that could dupe investors with something like “Ripple wins SEC case – XRP airdrop now live, claim tokens here.” Speaking of giveaway scams, they are easy to create and promote on various social media channels. Fraudsters often use actual clips of real Ripple events or interviews to layer a fake giveaway – “send 1,000 XRP to this address and receive 2,000 XRP back.” These scams appear polished, typically run via livestream loops, and utilize XRP’s lower price ($3 compared to BTC’s $120,000 and ETH’s $4,000) to lure smaller investors into participating, with the hope of multiplying their holdings. The last possible reason is slightly related to the first, as it aims to capitalize on Ripple’s popularity. The company and its native token are frequently trending on platforms like Google, X, and YouTube, which allows scammers to exploit this search traffic by creating fake SEO-optimized videos, thumbnails, and livestreams. This concludes our article on why Ripple might be under constant fire, especially as its native token just charted a new all-time high. Investors should trust only the official channels of all projects they are interested in, not just Ripple, double- and triple-check everything before engaging with them, and beware that when something sounds too good to be true, it usually is.

The media group behind Truth Social will use the funds to acquire options linked to BTC-related securities in a complex derivative strategy. Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) will allocate $300M to acquire options linked to BTC-related securities. The new investment follows previous direct purchases of BTC and other crypto assets. The details of the deal are still unclear, but may be related to a more complex strategy of tracking BTC price fluctuations. Trump’s individual posting on social media has shown a clear effect on the price of BTC, with the added effect of World Liberty Fi. Options trading may tap the price fluctuations, though exposing the company to other types of risk. TMTG also benefitted from the past month’s crypto performance, as the share price rose by over 6% net. TMTG traded at $19.15 following the news.

Currently, BTC exposure is possible through ETF, crypto company shares and preferred stock or convertible notes, as in the case of Strategy (MSTR). Options contracts may be risky if the market shifts its direction, letting the contracts expire without value.

2025-07-28 07:59:18+00:00,Why SpacePay Is The Top Altcoin to Invest in for Hot Gains This Summer,"The post Why SpacePay Is The Top Altcoin to Invest in for Hot Gains This Summer appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Everyone’s looking for the next big crypto opportunity this summer. Most projects talk a big game but deliver little substance. SpacePay does something different. This London startup lets businesses accept crypto payments through their existing card machines, converts everything to stable fiat currency instantly, and works with 325+ different wallets. They’ve pulled in over $1.2 million so far, and you can still grab $SPY tokens for $0.003181 each. Why SpacePay Works When Others Don’t Think about your local coffee shop or restaurant. The owner invested in a decent POS system that handles cards, tracks inventory, and manages sales. Now some crypto company wants them to buy another machine just for digital payments? That’s not realistic. SpacePay figured this out. Their software works with Android POS terminals that businesses already own. No new hardware needed. Just a software update and boom – the shop can accept payments from hundreds of different crypto wallets. The security side is pretty solid too. They use proper encryption and monitor transactions in real time. Nobody wants their payment system hacked, especially when dealing with irreversible crypto transactions. SpacePay seems to understand this concern. https://twitter.com/SpacePayLtd/status/1946903822778966418 This Altcoin Has The Lowest Fee Structure Around Let’s talk numbers for a minute. Credit card companies typically charge merchants 2.5% to 4% per transaction. That adds up fast for small businesses. If you’re running tight margins, those fees hurt. SpacePay charges 0.5%. That’s it. For a $100 sale, the merchant pays 50 cents instead of $3 or $4. Over a year, that difference could mean keeping the lights on or closing down. Other crypto payment solutions aren’t much better than traditional processors when it comes to fees. Some charge even more because they’re still figuring out their business model. SpacePay keeps it simple and affordable. Visit SpacePay Presale Smart Protection For Merchants Crypto prices jump around like crazy. Bitcoin can drop 10% in an hour. Ethereum might spike 15% overnight. That volatility terrifies business owners who need predictable income to pay rent and employees. SpacePay solves this problem in the most obvious way possible. When someone pays with crypto, the system immediately converts it to regular money. The merchant gets dollars, euros, or whatever currency they use. No price risk at all. This isn’t rocket science, but it’s exactly what businesses need. They want the benefits of accepting crypto without gambling on price movements. SpacePay delivers that stability while keeping everything simple. Understanding The Tokenomics Behind $SPY Most crypto projects create tokens just because they think they need them. The $SPY token serves real purposes in the SpacePay system. Token holders get voting rights on platform decisions. They receive monthly loyalty rewards. Plus, they earn a share of the company’s revenue. The total supply is capped at 34 billion tokens. Twenty percent goes to the public sale, which is happening now. The rest gets distributed for development, partnerships, marketing, and other business needs. Nothing too fancy, just a sensible allocation. Revenue sharing is probably the most interesting part. As SpacePay processes more transactions, token holders get paid. It’s like owning a tiny piece of the business. That creates real incentive to hold tokens long-term instead of just trading them. Breaking Down The Presale Structure The token price goes up at each stage of the presale. Early buyers get better prices than people who wait. Right now, tokens cost $0.003181 each. That price will increase as more people join. You can pay with major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Binance Coin. They also accept regular credit cards, which is handy if you don’t already own crypto. The whole process takes just a few minutes once you connect your wallet. SpacePay already built their core product and they’re working on regulatory compliance. That’s more progress than most crypto projects show during their fundraising phase. The team seems focused on building something that actually works rather than just hyping their token.

While the price is now moving sideways, many traders are looking ahead to October, a month known for strong Bitcoin rallies. With key signals flashing bullish, some believe a powerful crypto bull run may be just around the corner. Here’s how higher bitcoin price could surge by the ends of this year? And what might happen to altcoins if it does? Bitcoin Bull Market Expected in October Last week, Bitcoin closed with its highest weekly candle ever, over $119,000 . A major resistance level around $115,000, also known as the CME gap, has now been cleared. BTC is no longer in the overbought zone, which gives it more room to rise further. But it’s not just about charts. The global economic scene is also improving. The U.S. and China have extended their tariff pause, and the U.S. has signed a trade deal with the EU. These moves could ease pressure on financial markets and bring fresh money into crypto. Because of this, many analysts now believe Bitcoin could rise to around $132,000 by October. Why October Matters for Bitcoin October has a strong track record for Bitcoin. In the past one decade, Bitcoin as posted positive returns in 8 of the last 10 Octobers . This trend, combined with macro support and regulatory clarity, is giving traders hope for another big move. Some analysts say this could be the moment BTC breaks out and enters a parabolic uptrend. Even prediction markets like Polymarket suggest a 78% chance that Bitcoin will touch $130,000, with a 48% chance of hitting $150,000 by year-end. Impact On Altcoins If Bitcoin runs up, altcoins are likely to follow. Ethereum has already crossed $3,800 and is aiming for $4,200 and beyond. BNB just reached new highs. XRP and other altcoins are also hitting its ATH price. MEanwhile, liquidity is now spreading across the market, which often happens during the early phase of a bull cycle.

Bitcoin briefly surged past $119,000 on Sunday, continuing a strong rebound after touching two-week lows near $114,500. The price action marked a notable shift in momentum, with bulls reclaiming key levels despite recent heavy selling pressure. Volatility Returns Near Weekly Close Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView revealed BTC/USD regaining strength as it attempted a daily close above the 10-day simple moving average. This movement came as investors digested easing tensions between the U.S. and China, following an agreement to delay the implementation of reciprocal tariffs.

2025-07-28 08:10:11+00:00,Bitcoin Buy Zone: Unlocking Thielen’s $112K Opportunity,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Buy Zone: Unlocking Thielen’s $112K Opportunity Are you closely watching the cryptocurrency markets, searching for that opportune moment to expand your portfolio? For many investors, identifying the perfect Bitcoin Buy Zone is akin to finding a hidden treasure map in the volatile world of digital assets. Recent insights from a prominent industry expert suggest that such a zone might be closer than you think, potentially offering a strategic entry point for those looking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s next major move. Understanding the Bitcoin Buy Zone: Thielen’s Crucial Insight The cryptocurrency market, known for its rapid price swings, often presents unique opportunities for astute investors. Recently, attention has been drawn to a specific price level that could signal a significant buying opportunity for Bitcoin (BTC). According to CoinDesk, Markus Thielen, the respected head of research at Matrixport, has pinpointed the $111,673 mark as a potential sweet spot for accumulation. Thielen’s analysis is rooted in a fundamental principle of technical analysis: the transformation of resistance into support. What once acted as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s price in May could now serve as a solid floor, preventing further declines and providing a launching pad for a future rally. This shift is critical because it suggests a strengthening of market structure around this particular price point, making it a compelling Bitcoin Buy Zone for strategic investors. Why $111,673 is a Critical Bitcoin Buy Zone The significance of the $111,673 level isn’t arbitrary; it’s backed by historical price action. In May, Bitcoin encountered substantial selling pressure around this figure, preventing it from advancing higher. However, in the ever-evolving dynamics of financial markets, what was once a barrier can become a foundation. Here’s why this level is particularly important: Historical Resistance: The price point of $111,673 previously functioned as a strong resistance level. This means that a significant number of sellers were active at this price, preventing Bitcoin from breaking through. Potential Support Flip: When an asset manages to break above a resistance level and then retests it from above, that former resistance often transforms into new support. This ‘flip’ indicates that buyers who were previously hesitant or sellers who were active at that level have now capitulated or shifted their positions, paving the way for upward momentum. Validation of Strength: A successful retest and bounce off this level would validate Bitcoin’s underlying strength and the conviction of buyers, signaling that the market is ready for a more sustained upward trend. This retest is what defines the crucial Bitcoin Buy Zone . For investors, a slip below $112,000, specifically towards $111,673, isn’t necessarily a cause for alarm but rather a signal to prepare for potential entry. It’s a retest of strength, a chance for the market to confirm its bullish resolve before embarking on a stronger rally. Navigating Market Volatility: Strategies for the Bitcoin Buy Zone While identifying a potential Bitcoin Buy Zone is valuable, it’s equally important to pair this insight with a robust trading strategy. Market volatility is a constant in crypto, and even the most promising setups require careful risk management. Thielen’s analysis extends beyond just identifying the buy zone; it also offers guidance on managing positions as the market evolves. Here’s how investors might approach this: Price Level Thielen’s Analysis Strategic Implication $111,673 Former resistance, now potential support. Key Bitcoin Buy Zone for accumulation, anticipating a retest and bounce. Below $112,000 Favorable buying opportunity as BTC dips. Consider staggered entries or monitoring for a bounce from the $111,673 level. Above $120,000 (Sustained Breakout) Indicates a strong trend reversal. Implement tighter stop-loss strategies to protect gains and manage risk in a confirmed uptrend. A sustained breakout above $120,000 would be a strong indicator of a trend reversal. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it signals that Bitcoin has firmly established an upward trajectory. At this point, Thielen advises a shift in strategy: employing tighter stop-loss orders. This proactive risk management ensures that profits are locked in and potential losses are minimized, even if the market experiences an unexpected downturn after a significant rally. Is This the Ultimate Bitcoin Buy Zone Opportunity? While Thielen’s analysis provides a compelling argument for a strategic Bitcoin Buy Zone , it’s essential to consider the broader market context and individual investment goals. No single indicator guarantees future price movements, but expert insights, especially from reputable sources like Matrixport, offer valuable perspectives. The idea of a retest acting as a strong support level is a classic technical pattern, often observed across various financial markets.

2025-07-28 08:31:24+00:00,BTC could hit a new ATH if it holds above $120K: check forecast,"The cryptocurrency market was bearish last week, with over $200 billion wiped out from the market. However, market conditions improved over the weekend, with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies currently in the green. BTC is looking to break past the $120k resistance level amid institutional backing and could rally higher if market conditions persist over the coming hours and days. Trump’s EU tariff deal boosts investor confidence, Metaplanet adds 780 Bitcoins to holding The cryptocurrency market turned bullish over the weekend thanks to some macroeconomic news. On Sunday, President Donald Trump confirmed a tariff deal with the European Union, scaling levies down to 15% from the previously threatened 30%. The announcement sent the broader cryptocurrency market rallying, with Bitcoin adding 1% to its value to top the $119k mark. Bitcoin could break above the $120k resistance soon and could rally towards a new all-time high. While speaking with CoinDesk, Nassar Al Achkar, Chief Strategy Officer at CoinW, said, “Bitcoin maintained a resilient range and rebounded to $119k after old wallets with tens of thousands of BTC began transferring funds to exchanges, which led some traders to fear a market correction. Numerous institutions continue to onboard into the crypto industry and utilize reserve strategies, showcasing strong demand against recent surges of stock prices.” In addition to that, Japanese firm Metaplanet has continued its Bitcoin buying spree. The company purchased 780 bitcoins for $92.5 million, with an average price of $118,622 per BTC. Thanks to this latest acquisition, Metaplanet now holds 17,132 BTC, worth about $2 billion at current market prices. According to Metaplanet’s CEO, Simon Gerovich, the firm’s average Bitcoin purchase price is now $101,030. BTC could hit a new ATH if the price breaks above $120k The BTC/USD 4-hour chart is bullish and efficient, with a market structure shift created a few hours ago. This indicates a bullish momentum, with the weekly candle also closing bullish. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $119,014 and is approaching its upper consolidation boundary at $120,000. If Bitcoin’s daily candle closes above the $120k resistance level, it could extend its recovery towards the all-time high price of $123k. An extended bullish run would allow BTC to set a new all-time high around $125k or higher. The 4-hour Relative Strength Index of 53 shows that buyers are regaining control of the market. The MACD lines also crossed into the positive region a few hours ago, suggesting a switch to the bullish bias. However, if BTC fails to close its daily candle above $120k, it might undergo a correction that would allow it to test last week’s low of $115k.

2025-07-28 08:40:27+00:00,Bitcoin Penguins presale goes live later today: check out details,"Altcoins saw a sharp surge over the past 24 hours, with PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Jupiter (JUP) leading gains amid renewed buying pressure across the market. Meme coin SPX6900 (SPX) surged to a new all-time high, breaking above the $2 mark and ranking third by market cap at press time. Ethereum (ETH) led the broader altcoin rally, rising over 3% to cross the $3,900 level. The surge followed news that SharpLink Gaming, backed by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, purchased an additional 77,210 ETH—worth approximately $295 million—as part of its ongoing accumulation strategy. The CMC Altcoin Season Index rose to 44, up from 21 last month, signalling increasing investor interest beyond Bitcoin. A new altcoin, Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU), is set to begin its presale later today, aiming to capitalise on the dual momentum of meme-driven enthusiasm and Bitcoin’s recent breakout to new record highs. Positioned at the intersection of viral meme culture and crypto market strength, BPENGU blends the appeal of penguin-themed tokens with the renewed bullishness surrounding Bitcoin. With BTC’s latest rally fueling risk-on sentiment, the project is hoping to ride that wave into the ranks of the top 50 tokens. Why Bitcoin Pengu can grab eyeballs The project aims to blend meme appeal with integration into Bitcoin infrastructure, positioning itself as a potential beneficiary of Bitcoin’s ongoing rally. Among the standout features is a weekly 1 BTC jackpot distributed to top stakers, with rewards issued transparently on-chain—an incentive that aligns with the coin’s alignment to Bitcoin maximalist values. Backed by Bitcoin’s surge above $120,000 this quarter and continued institutional inflows, the broader market has entered what many view as the early phase of altseason. The altcoin season index, which tracks relative performance between Bitcoin and altcoins, has climbed sharply over the past month, suggesting capital rotation is underway. With Bitcoin’s rally showing signs of plateauing, capital rotation appears to be underway, with funds moving into themed altcoins such as BPENGU. The combination of strong Bitcoin momentum, rising interest in meme assets, and the onset of altseason is creating favourable conditions for projects embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem. The presale is going to go live soon The presale for Bitcoin Penguins brings structure and urgency to the token’s early-stage offering, with a clear end date and a dynamic pricing model designed to reward early buyers. The presale is split into 15 stages, with the price of BPENGU increasing by 5% at each successive stage. This results in a cumulative price increase of 75% from Stage 1 through Stage 15. Investors who enter during the initial stage stand to see notional gains of over 75% by the time the token launches. This escalating price mechanism is aimed at creating strong early momentum and encouraging timely participation, in contrast to the open-ended presales that have recently faced fatigue among crypto investors. The presale is strictly limited to 30 days, ending on August 27, or earlier if the project hits its $10 million hard cap. The team has also confirmed a claim and public listing date of September 2, giving buyers a definitive schedule from day one. That clarity—rare in current presale cycles—is likely to resonate with investors eager for transparency and timely token delivery. The project is positioning itself to capitalise on both Bitcoin’s recent surge past $120,000 and the growing popularity of meme tokens. The combination of a structured presale, thematic branding, and integration into the Bitcoin ecosystem has helped BPENGU gain early attention as the next possible breakout in the altcoin space.

2025-07-28 08:55:10+00:00,Digital Asset Inflows Surge: Ethereum Leads Remarkable $1.9 Billion Boom on ETF Optimism,"BitcoinWorld Digital Asset Inflows Surge: Ethereum Leads Remarkable $1.9 Billion Boom on ETF Optimism The cryptocurrency market is buzzing, and for good reason! We’re witnessing a truly remarkable shift in investor sentiment, as evidenced by a colossal influx of capital into digital asset investment products. Last week alone, a staggering $1.9 billion flowed into these products, marking an impressive 15th consecutive week of positive sentiment. This sustained interest underscores a growing confidence among institutional and retail investors alike, particularly as the spotlight turns towards potential new investment avenues. But what’s truly fascinating is which digital assets are leading this charge, and what it signals for the broader crypto landscape. Understanding the Recent Digital Asset Inflows According to the latest Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report by CoinShares, published in a detailed Medium blog post, the narrative is clear: while overall sentiment is positive, the distribution of these Digital Asset Inflows tells a compelling story of market rotation and anticipation. This report serves as a crucial barometer for institutional interest and investor allocation trends within the digital asset space. Here’s a quick breakdown of where the capital is heading: Ethereum (ETH): Leading the pack with an astonishing $1.59 billion in inflows. This marks its second-largest weekly inflow on record, highlighting an unprecedented surge of interest. Solana (SOL): Not far behind in terms of significant gains, attracting a robust $311 million . XRP: Showing strong resilience and renewed interest with $189 million in inflows. Bitcoin (BTC): In a surprising turn, the king of crypto experienced $175 million in outflows. This dynamic flow of capital suggests a strategic reallocation by investors, moving beyond Bitcoin to explore opportunities in other promising digital assets. But what exactly is fueling this shift, especially Ethereum’s meteoric rise in inflows? Why is Ethereum Leading the Charge in Digital Asset Inflows? The primary catalyst for Ethereum’s exceptional performance in attracting Digital Asset Inflows is the escalating optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States. Following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the market is now eagerly awaiting similar developments for Ethereum. The anticipation is palpable, and for good reason: Legitimacy and Accessibility: An Ethereum ETF would provide a regulated, easily accessible investment vehicle for institutional investors and traditional finance players who might be hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. This opens up a vast new pool of capital. Validation of the Asset Class: ETF approvals signal regulatory acceptance and maturity of the underlying asset, boosting investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability and utility. Comparison to Bitcoin ETF Success: The success of Bitcoin ETFs in attracting billions in inflows has set a precedent, suggesting that an Ethereum ETF could see similar, if not greater, demand given Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. CoinShares explicitly attributes this altcoin demand to the anticipation of U.S. spot ETF launches, rather than a broad-based market enthusiasm for all digital assets. This distinction is crucial, as it suggests a targeted, strategic investment approach driven by specific regulatory milestones. The Altcoin Awakening: Solana and XRP Join the Inflow Party While Ethereum’s inflows are undoubtedly the headline, the substantial Digital Asset Inflows into Solana and XRP cannot be overlooked. These figures suggest a broader institutional interest in high-performance altcoins and established projects with strong community backing: Solana’s Appeal: Known for its high transaction speeds and low fees, Solana has emerged as a strong contender in the blockchain space, particularly for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. Its growing ecosystem and developer activity likely contribute to its attractiveness for investors seeking alternatives to Ethereum. XRP’s Resurgence: Despite its past regulatory challenges, XRP continues to command significant attention, particularly for its utility in cross-border payments. Renewed optimism surrounding its legal clarity and potential for wider adoption in financial institutions could be driving these inflows. These inflows indicate a diversification strategy among institutional investors, looking beyond the top two cryptocurrencies to capture growth in other promising blockchain ecosystems. Bitcoin’s Outflow: A Cause for Concern or Strategic Rebalancing? The $175 million in outflows from Bitcoin products might seem concerning at first glance, especially given its status as the market leader. However, CoinShares offers a nuanced perspective, suggesting that this isn’t necessarily a sign of bearish sentiment for Bitcoin itself.

Following the landmark approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the market is now eagerly awaiting similar developments for Ethereum. The anticipation is palpable, and for good reason: Legitimacy and Accessibility: An Ethereum ETF would provide a regulated, easily accessible investment vehicle for institutional investors and traditional finance players who might be hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. This opens up a vast new pool of capital. Validation of the Asset Class: ETF approvals signal regulatory acceptance and maturity of the underlying asset, boosting investor confidence in Ethereum’s long-term viability and utility. Comparison to Bitcoin ETF Success: The success of Bitcoin ETFs in attracting billions in inflows has set a precedent, suggesting that an Ethereum ETF could see similar, if not greater, demand given Ethereum’s role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. CoinShares explicitly attributes this altcoin demand to the anticipation of U.S. spot ETF launches, rather than a broad-based market enthusiasm for all digital assets. This distinction is crucial, as it suggests a targeted, strategic investment approach driven by specific regulatory milestones. The Altcoin Awakening: Solana and XRP Join the Inflow Party While Ethereum’s inflows are undoubtedly the headline, the substantial Digital Asset Inflows into Solana and XRP cannot be overlooked. These figures suggest a broader institutional interest in high-performance altcoins and established projects with strong community backing: Solana’s Appeal: Known for its high transaction speeds and low fees, Solana has emerged as a strong contender in the blockchain space, particularly for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. Its growing ecosystem and developer activity likely contribute to its attractiveness for investors seeking alternatives to Ethereum. XRP’s Resurgence: Despite its past regulatory challenges, XRP continues to command significant attention, particularly for its utility in cross-border payments. Renewed optimism surrounding its legal clarity and potential for wider adoption in financial institutions could be driving these inflows. These inflows indicate a diversification strategy among institutional investors, looking beyond the top two cryptocurrencies to capture growth in other promising blockchain ecosystems. Bitcoin’s Outflow: A Cause for Concern or Strategic Rebalancing? The $175 million in outflows from Bitcoin products might seem concerning at first glance, especially given its status as the market leader. However, CoinShares offers a nuanced perspective, suggesting that this isn’t necessarily a sign of bearish sentiment for Bitcoin itself. Instead,"

This week, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin market trends , as several pivotal factors converge to shape its immediate future. From macro-economic indicators to subtle shifts in global trade and on-chain liquidity, understanding these forces is crucial for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the digital asset space. Let’s dive deep into the five key elements outlined by Cointelegraph that demand your attention. Decoding Bitcoin’s Price Trajectory: Is a $113,000 Revisit on the Horizon for Bitcoin Market Trends? The cryptocurrency market is a perpetual motion machine, and Bitcoin, as its flagship asset, is always at the center of attention. This week, analysts are flagging a potential downside, with some suggesting a possible drop toward the $113,000 mark. This isn’t just a random number; it’s often tied to specific technical analysis points, such as key support levels or the lower bounds of trading channels. What’s driving this concern? A ‘mixed momentum’ signal suggests that while there might be underlying bullish sentiment or buying interest, it’s being counterbalanced by selling pressure or a lack of strong conviction from buyers. This could manifest as: Lower Highs: The price struggles to surpass previous peaks, indicating weakening upward momentum. Increased Selling Volume: Larger sell orders pushing the price down on key resistance breaks. Breakdown of Key Support: If a crucial support level, like a 200-day moving average or a psychological round number, is breached, it can trigger further sell-offs as stop-loss orders are hit. For investors, this potential downside highlights the importance of risk management. While a drop to $113,000 might seem daunting, it could also present a buying opportunity for those with a long-term outlook. It’s a reminder that volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and preparing for both upward and downward swings is part of the game. Keep an eye on the volume accompanying any price moves; high volume on a price decline often signifies stronger conviction behind the move. Economic Juggernauts: How Macro Data Shapes Bitcoin Market Trends Beyond the charts, the broader economic landscape plays an increasingly significant role in shaping Bitcoin market trends . This week is particularly packed with high-impact economic data from the United States, which often sends ripples across global financial markets, including crypto. The Federal Reserve’s Rate Decision: The U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision is arguably the most anticipated event. A rate hike or even a hawkish stance (signaling future hikes) typically strengthens the U.S. dollar and can make riskier assets like Bitcoin less attractive as investors seek safer, yield-bearing alternatives. Conversely, a dovish stance (signaling rate cuts or a pause) can weaken the dollar and potentially boost risk assets. The market will be scrutinizing not just the decision itself, but also the accompanying statement and press conference for clues about the Fed’s future monetary policy trajectory. Q2 GDP and PCE Inflation Data: These two data points provide a snapshot of the U.S. economy’s health: Q2 GDP (Gross Domestic Product): This measures the total economic output. A strong GDP indicates a robust economy, which can sometimes lead to tighter monetary policy (negative for crypto) or reflect strong consumer spending (positive for corporate earnings and broader market sentiment). PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) Inflation Data: This is the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. If PCE inflation remains stubbornly high, it could reinforce the Fed’s resolve to keep rates elevated, potentially dampening crypto enthusiasm. A significant drop in PCE could signal that inflation is under control, giving the Fed more flexibility. Historically, Bitcoin has shown a complex relationship with traditional markets. Sometimes it acts as a ‘risk-on’ asset, moving in tandem with tech stocks; other times, it’s viewed as a hedge against inflation or economic instability. This week’s macro data will be a critical test of how Bitcoin reacts to these traditional economic pressures. Global Trade Dynamics: A Hidden Driver for Bitcoin Market Trends? While often overlooked in daily crypto analysis, global geopolitical and trade developments can have profound, albeit indirect, impacts on Bitcoin market trends . This week, progress on a potential U.S.-EU-Japan trade deal and delays in tariff implementations are on the radar. How does this connect to Bitcoin? Investor Confidence: Positive developments in global trade foster economic stability and boost investor confidence. This can lead to increased capital flows into various asset classes, including risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Currency Strength: Trade deals can influence the strength of major fiat currencies.

It comes with several key benefits. These include preferential rates on loans over $1 million, direct access to a dedicated Relationship Manager, and “complimentary loan rebalances” when the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio improves. Moreover, these clients gain accelerated processing of withdrawals, disbursements, and support requests, the team says. Finally, they get access to Ledn’s executive team and exclusive events. Meanwhile, the company reported increased investor interest in and client demand for tailored credit terms, personalized service, and fast liquidity. Therefore, the Private Wealth program is “a direct response to this emerging behavior and includes services previously delivered informally to top clients,” the press release says. Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder and CSO at Ledn, commented that BTC-backed loans are going mainstream. “Our most sophisticated clients are using them to fund everything from real estate to new businesses, while keeping upside exposure,” he says. “The Private Wealth program gives them the tools, speed, and trust to operate at scale.” You may also like: Adam Reeds, CEO of Ledn, on Crypto Lending and Why Bitcoin Makes Great Collateral | Ep. 281 A group of Senate Democrats is demanding answers from the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) over a controversial move to consider crypto assets in mortgage assessments.In a letter sent Friday, five senators led by Jeff Merkley raised concerns about FHFA Director William Pulte’s recent directive instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to explore how crypto holdings could factor into mortgage risk evaluations without being converted into US dollars.The letter,... $2.4 Billion in Loans Processed in 2024 Ledn says that in the second quarter of 2025, it originated $329 million in BTC-backed loans for retail customers.

It facilitated over $690 million in loans, with $584 million going to institutional clients and $106 million to retail investors. Then, in Q3 2024, Ledn managed loan transactions of over $506 million. Up to that point, for 2024 year-to-date, it processed $1.67 billion . In the latest press release, the company says it processed a record $2.4 billion in loans in 2024. Bitcoin isn’t just a HODL game. It’s collateral. It’s income. It’s leverage.

JPMorgan is looking into crypto-collateralized loans . This is a milestone for the sector. That said, Ledn says that it is ahead of traditional institutions. It has already developed the custody, risk management, and liquidation infrastructure to support BTC-backed credit at scale, it states. Moreover, crypto-native investors are increasingly adopting “a version of the MicroStrategy playbook: hold BTC, borrow against it, and deploy capital into yield-bearing or growth strategies while preserving upside exposure.” According to Adam Reeds, co-founder and CEO at Ledn, Private Wealth clients “entrust us with significant portions of their digital assets.” Therefore, the newly launched program “formalizes our commitment to these valued relationships while creating clear pathways for more clients to access premium services as they grow their holdings,” Reeds concludes.

It facilitated over $690 million in loans, with $584 million going to institutional clients and $106 million to retail investors. Then, in Q3 2024, Ledn managed loan transactions of over $506 million. Up to that point, for 2024 year-to-date, it processed $1.67 billion . In the latest press release, the company says it processed a record $2.4 billion in loans in 2024. Bitcoin isn’t just a HODL game. It’s collateral. It’s income. It’s leverage.

JPMorgan is looking into crypto-collateralized loans . This is a milestone for the sector. That said, Ledn says that it is ahead of traditional institutions. It has already developed the custody, risk management, and liquidation infrastructure to support BTC-backed credit at scale, it states. Moreover, crypto-native investors are increasingly adopting “a version of the MicroStrategy playbook: hold BTC, borrow against it, and deploy capital into yield-bearing or growth strategies while preserving upside exposure.” According to Adam Reeds, co-founder and CEO at Ledn, Private Wealth clients “entrust us with significant portions of their digital assets.” Therefore, the newly launched program “formalizes our commitment to these valued relationships while creating clear pathways for more clients to access premium services as they grow their holdings,” Reeds concludes.

If you’re following the dynamic ebb and flow of digital assets, then understanding regional community sentiment is absolutely crucial. In the vibrant and highly influential South Korean market, often referred to as the K-Community, investor behavior can offer unique insights into broader market sentiment and emerging interests. This past week, from July 18 to 24, we saw some fascinating Korean crypto trends emerge from the depths of Bitcoin World’s K-Community data, highlighting which tokens truly captured the attention of this influential investor base. What Are the Current Korean Crypto Trends? Unveiling K-Community Insights The South Korean cryptocurrency market is renowned globally for its passionate and active community. Often, trends originating here can ripple outwards, influencing broader Asian and even global markets. Bitcoin World’s K-Community provides a valuable lens into this unique ecosystem, offering a glimpse into what tokens are sparking curiosity and discussion among its members. For the period between July 18 and 24, we’ve compiled data on the most searched for and mentioned tokens, giving us a clear picture of the prevailing Korean crypto trends . This data is not just a list; it’s a snapshot of collective interest, reflecting a mix of established giants, rising stars, and even niche tokens. Understanding these patterns can help investors and enthusiasts gauge market sentiment, identify potential movers, and stay informed about the specific interests driving one of the world’s most engaged crypto communities. Diving Deep into Top Searched Tokens: Understanding Key Korean Crypto Trends When the K-Community hits the search bar, what are they looking for? The “Top 10 searched tokens” list reveals a compelling story about investor curiosity and potential interest in new developments or opportunities. Here’s a breakdown of the tokens that dominated search queries: Token Search Volume XRP 77,148 SOL 20,370 ETH 18,477 DOGE 14,466 ONDO 13,596 ADA 10,065 STRIKE 7,602 BTC 6,813 UXLINK 6,600 ENA 6,255 The standout here is unequivocally XRP , commanding an astonishing 77,148 searches – more than three times its closest competitor. This overwhelming interest is likely tied to the ongoing legal developments surrounding Ripple and the SEC. Any news, rumors, or court filings related to the case tend to generate significant buzz, and the K-Community, known for its active participation, is clearly keeping a close watch on potential outcomes that could dramatically impact XRP’s price and market standing. The hope for a favorable resolution or a significant turning point in the lawsuit often fuels intense search activity. Following XRP, we see familiar heavyweights like SOL (Solana) and ETH (Ethereum) holding strong positions. Their consistent presence reflects their foundational role in the broader crypto ecosystem and ongoing developments within their respective networks, such as upgrades, dApp growth, or NFT activity. DOGE (Dogecoin) continues to capture attention, indicative of the enduring appeal of meme coins and their often-volatile price movements driven by social media sentiment and celebrity endorsements. Intriguingly, newer or less established tokens like ONDO , UXLINK , and ENA have also made their way into the top searches. ONDO, often associated with real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, might be gaining traction due to increasing interest in this emerging sector. UXLINK and ENA could be attracting searches due to recent listings, promising new features, or specific community-driven campaigns. Their appearance suggests that the K-Community is not just focused on blue-chip assets but is also actively exploring newer, potentially high-growth opportunities. Even BTC (Bitcoin), the market leader, finds itself lower on this list of searched tokens, which isn’t a sign of disinterest but rather an indication that users are likely searching for specific, potentially more volatile altcoins for short-term opportunities or detailed news. What Tokens Are Sparking Conversations? Analyzing Mentioned Korean Crypto Trends While searches indicate curiosity, mentions reveal active discussion and community engagement.

2025-07-28 09:16:51+00:00,"Fed Decision, $175M Token Unlocks, and Starknet Upgrade Set to Rock Crypto Markets This Week","The cryptocurrency market stands at a pivotal moment as we enter the final week of July 2025. With Bitcoin and major altcoins showing renewed momentum after months of consolidation, three key events are poised to create significant market volatility and potentially establish the trajectory for August trading. The Federal Reserve Takes Center Stage Wednesday''s Federal Open Market Committee meeting represents the week''s most consequential event for crypto markets. While the financial world expects rates to hold steady at the current 4.25%-4.50% range, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell''s afternoon press conference could send shockwaves through digital asset markets. The crypto community has developed an increasingly sophisticated understanding of how monetary policy impacts digital assets. Lower interest rates traditionally weaken the dollar and drive investors toward higher-risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, any hawkish rhetoric about future rate hikes could trigger a flight to traditional safe havens. Market sentiment heading into the meeting appears cautiously optimistic, with prediction markets showing overwhelming confidence that rates will remain unchanged. However, Powell''s commentary on inflation trends, employment data, and the Fed''s forward guidance will likely prove more impactful than the rate decision itself. For crypto traders, Wednesday afternoon represents a make-or-break moment. A dovish pivot could unleash the next major rally phase, while unexpectedly hawkish tones might derail the recent recovery momentum that has lifted Bitcoin above key technical levels. Token Unlocks Create Supply-Side Pressure The cryptocurrency market faces a significant supply shock this week as major projects release previously locked tokens worth over $175 million. These unlock events represent one of the most underappreciated drivers of short-term price volatility in digital assets. Jupiter leads the unlock schedule with over 53 million tokens entering circulation on Monday afternoon. Having rallied approximately 50% throughout July, Jupiter faces a critical test as early investors and team members gain the ability to liquidate their holdings. The timing proves particularly challenging given the token''s recent outperformance. SUI''s unlock dwarfs others in dollar terms, with $108 million worth of tokens becoming tradeable. While this represents less than 1% of the total supply, the sheer magnitude creates potential for significant selling pressure, especially if institutional holders decide to rebalance their positions. Optimism rounds out the major unlocks with $21.5 million in tokens entering circulation. As one of the leading Layer 2 scaling solutions, Optimism''s price action could influence broader sentiment toward Ethereum-based scaling technologies. The psychological impact of unlock events often exceeds their fundamental significance. Even when recipients choose not to sell immediately, the mere possibility of increased supply can weigh on prices and create choppy trading conditions. Starknet''s Technological Leap Forward Monday''s launch of Starknet V0.14.0 represents a watershed moment for Ethereum Layer 2 scaling technology. The upgrade introduces distributed sequencer architecture, marking Starknet''s first major step toward true decentralization – a critical differentiator in the increasingly competitive Layer 2 landscape. The technical improvements extend beyond decentralization. Block times shrink to just two seconds, dramatically improving user experience and positioning Starknet to compete more effectively with established players like Arbitrum and Optimism. The implementation of mempool functionality and fee markets brings additional sophistication to transaction processing. Pre-confirmed transactions represent perhaps the most user-facing improvement, addressing one of the key friction points that have limited broader DeFi adoption. By reducing confirmation uncertainty, Starknet aims to create a more seamless experience for both developers and end users. Major network upgrades historically generate increased trading activity and price volatility. The combination of technical improvements and the psychological impact of a successful upgrade often creates a catalyst for renewed interest in the underlying token.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/the-week-ahead,MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS,,BTC,"Fed Decision, $175M Token Unlocks, and Starknet Upgrade Set to Rock Crypto Markets This Week.

The project is designed to reflect on the original principles underlying Bitcoin’s creation and to explore new directions through community participation and knowledge sharing in the current blockchain environment. The memecoin sector continues to maintain visibility, with assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) contributing to broader market activity. According to CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of memecoins stands at approximately $54 billion. Within this landscape, SatoshiMeme introduces an approach that emphasizes philosophical reflection. The project highlights the theme of “returning to Bitcoin’s fundamentals” as a central concept, distinguishing itself from other memecoin initiatives. The Place Where Satoshi Once Resided: A 16-Year Homecoming SatoshiMeme''s most distinctive feature is the direct participation of the P2P Foundation, the only digital space where Satoshi Nakamoto first publicly announced Bitcoin in 2009. The P2P Foundation holds the unique significance in Bitcoin history as the platform that still possesses Satoshi Nakamoto''s only account and posts. At that time, Satoshi Nakamoto announced on the P2P Foundation, ""I have been working on a P2P electronic cash system, and I am now releasing the beta version,"" sharing the Bitcoin whitepaper and initial software. This was the historic moment when Bitcoin was first introduced to the world. P2P Foundation founder Michel Bauwens stated, ""We expect the SatoshiMeme project to support the P2P Foundation''s knowledge sharing activities and contribute to fund creation for public interest-based projects. This is a meaningful attempt to realize the values of cooperation and openness that Satoshi Nakamoto pursued in a contemporary way."" Questioning Bitcoin''s Essence Through Memes SatoshiMeme presents reflection on the current cryptocurrency market through a whitepaper released under the concept of ""The Return of Satoshi Nakamoto."" The whitepaper points to the reality of Bitcoin''s transformation into a financial product through a hypothetical message from Satoshi: ""Bitcoin is no longer the free currency I sent to the world."" The project humorously conveys complex blockchain concepts through ''Satoshi Scripture'' parodies, strengthening genuine community belonging through its unique educational approach. Detailed information about SatoshiMeme is available on the official website (satoshimemes.com).

It operates in an open-source manner with developers from around the world participating. The Commons Foundation announced plans to expand cooperation with Bitcoin communities worldwide through SatoshiMeme. The foundation aims to spread the practical value of decentralization and P2P economics through creative collaboration with open-source developers, and support the continuous development of the cryptocurrency field.

The project is designed to reflect on the original principles underlying Bitcoin’s creation and to explore new directions through community participation and knowledge sharing in the current blockchain environment. The memecoin sector continues to maintain visibility, with assets such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe (PEPE) contributing to broader market activity. According to CoinMarketCap, the total market capitalization of memecoins stands at approximately $54 billion. Within this landscape, SatoshiMeme introduces an approach that emphasizes philosophical reflection. The project highlights the theme of “returning to Bitcoin’s fundamentals” as a central concept, distinguishing itself from other memecoin initiatives. The Place Where Satoshi Once Resided: A 16-Year Homecoming SatoshiMeme’s most distinctive feature is the direct participation of the P2P Foundation, the only digital space where Satoshi Nakamoto first publicly announced Bitcoin in 2009. The P2P Foundation holds the unique significance in Bitcoin history as the platform that still possesses Satoshi Nakamoto’s only account and posts. At that time, Satoshi Nakamoto announced on the P2P Foundation, “I have been working on a P2P electronic cash system, and I am now releasing the beta version,” sharing the Bitcoin whitepaper and initial software. This was the historic moment when Bitcoin was first introduced to the world. P2P Foundation founder Michel Bauwens stated, “We expect the SatoshiMeme project to support the P2P Foundation’s knowledge sharing activities and contribute to fund creation for public interest-based projects. This is a meaningful attempt to realize the values of cooperation and openness that Satoshi Nakamoto pursued in a contemporary way.” Questioning Bitcoin’s Essence Through Memes SatoshiMeme presents reflection on the current cryptocurrency market through a whitepaper released under the concept of “The Return of Satoshi Nakamoto.” The whitepaper points to the reality of Bitcoin’s transformation into a financial product through a hypothetical message from Satoshi: “Bitcoin is no longer the free currency I sent to the world.” The project humorously conveys complex blockchain concepts through ‘Satoshi Scripture’ parodies, strengthening genuine community belonging through its unique educational approach. Detailed information about SatoshiMeme is available on the official website (satoshimemes.com). Alternative Economy Realization Through Community Collaboration SatoshiMeme is built on the MicroBitcoin (MBC) blockchain, which hard-forked from Bitcoin’s 525,000th block. MBC is a project that started in 2018 with the goal of implementing the micro-economic currency function that Satoshi pursued. It operates in an open-source manner with developers from around the world participating. The Commons Foundation announced plans to expand cooperation with Bitcoin communities worldwide through SatoshiMeme. The foundation aims to spread the practical value of decentralization and P2P economics through creative collaboration with open-source developers, and support the continuous development of the cryptocurrency field. Currently, listing discussions are underway with major exchanges worldwide, with plans for phased market entry through launchpads and presales. This project presents the goal of promoting community-based economic experiments through a contemporary reinterpretation of Satoshi Nakamoto’s philosophy.

2025-07-28 09:30:10+00:00,Bitcoin Accumulation: Unwavering Investor Confidence at $117K,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Accumulation: Unwavering Investor Confidence at $117K Are you tracking the pulse of the crypto market? If so, you’ve likely noticed a fascinating trend emerging around the $117,000 price point for Bitcoin. This isn’t just another number on a chart; it signifies a robust area of interest where Bitcoin accumulation is reaching remarkable levels. It suggests a powerful underlying demand that could shape future market dynamics. For many long-term holders and new entrants alike, this specific price level has become a magnet for sustained buying activity, signaling strong confidence in the digital asset’s future. Why is Bitcoin Accumulation So Significant at $117K? The cryptocurrency market is a vibrant ecosystem, constantly evolving and reacting to a myriad of factors. However, certain price levels often act as critical junctures, revealing deeper market psychology and investor conviction. Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics firm, recently highlighted on X that approximately 73,000 Bitcoin (BTC) are now held at the $117,000 level. This isn’t just a random statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of sustained investor interest and a testament to the market’s belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition. A Strong Support Zone: When a significant amount of an asset is held at a particular price, it often indicates a strong support level. This means that buyers are consistently stepping in whenever the price dips to or near this point, preventing further declines. Investor Confidence: The sheer volume of BTC held at this level underscores a high degree of confidence among investors. They are not just holding; they are actively adding to their positions, suggesting they believe the current price offers good value for future appreciation. Absorption of Dips: Glassnode specifically noted that “dips in this range are consistently being absorbed as accumulation continues.” This is crucial. It means that any sell-offs or profit-taking attempts around this price are quickly met with buying pressure, reinforcing the strength of this accumulation zone. This sustained Bitcoin accumulation at a specific price point suggests a maturation of the market, where participants are increasingly looking beyond short-term volatility and focusing on long-term value. Decoding the Data: Glassnode’s Insights into Bitcoin Accumulation On-chain analytics firms like Glassnode provide invaluable insights by examining transactions directly on the blockchain. Unlike traditional market analysis, which often relies on exchange data, on-chain data offers a transparent view of actual network activity, giving us a clearer picture of investor behavior. Glassnode’s methodology tracks the movement of Bitcoin, identifying addresses that have acquired BTC at specific price levels and held onto them. When they report 73,000 BTC held at $117,000, it means that a substantial amount of Bitcoin was acquired by unique entities (or clusters of entities representing a single holder) when the price was around that mark, and these entities have not yet moved those coins. This indicates a strong conviction among these holders. Consider the implications of such data: Metric Interpretation for $117K Accumulation Held Supply Large volume of BTC bought and not sold, indicating long-term conviction. Accumulation Trends Consistent buying behavior, suggesting a strategic entry point for investors. Supply Shock Potential As more BTC is accumulated and held, less is available on exchanges, potentially leading to price increases if demand surges. Market Structure The $117K level acts as a psychological and technical anchor, strengthening market stability. This deep dive into on-chain metrics provides a more robust understanding of market sentiment than simply looking at price charts. It reveals the fundamental strength building beneath the surface, driven by consistent Bitcoin accumulation . The Psychology Behind Sustained Bitcoin Accumulation Why do investors continue to accumulate Bitcoin, especially at a specific price like $117,000? The answer lies in a blend of fundamental belief, strategic thinking, and a historical understanding of Bitcoin’s market cycles. 1. Long-Term Conviction: Many Bitcoin investors are driven by a strong belief in its long-term potential as a store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a decentralized digital currency. They view dips as opportunities to “buy the dip” and add to their holdings, rather than signals to sell. 2. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For many, accumulation isn’t about timing the market perfectly but rather about consistently investing a fixed amount over time, regardless of price fluctuations. This strategy, known as Dollar-Cost Averaging, helps reduce the impact of volatility and is a common approach to Bitcoin accumulation . 3. Halving Cycle Awareness: Bitcoin undergoes a “halving” event approximately every four years, which reduces the supply of new BTC entering the market.

2025-07-28 09:38:23+00:00,BITW: Against My Bitcoin‑Maximalist Philosophy,"Summary Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF catches my attention during the screening of new strong buy ratings. The benchmark of BITW is simple, transparent, and representative. Unfortunately, its structure seems to present itself in a less efficient way. In the long term, neither an effective hedge nor any alpha can be observed compared to holding only Bitcoin in the portfolio. This confirms my maximalist soul: I think BTC is enough to represent the crypto segment in a portfolio, and that the concept of diversification in DeFi is overrated. ""In the middle of a bull market , is it better to stay maximalist on BTC, or also gain exposure to altcoins?"" It''s with this question that I approach the study of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund ETF ( OTC:BITW ), an instrument that in theory offers more diversified exposure to the crypto market. Well, it''s a challenging question. And yet it leads to a clear answer. Beyond the fact that I think BITW still has structural issues that are hard to digest, I still don''t see concrete advantages from diversifying into other altcoins. My personal opinion? Even today, BTC maximalism wins. What Kind of Fund is It? BITW is neither an ETF nor a CEF: it is a Delaware Statutory Trust with shares traded on OTCQX. Although the benchmark index, the Bitwise 10 Large Cap Crypto Index, is indeed a sort of S&P 500 of crypto, we certainly cannot say that BITW is destined to become as solid as the SPY ETF. Simply put, the index tries to represent in a single instrument the performance of the 10 largest cryptos by market capitalization (free-float adjusted), following a rules‑based methodology, but the problem is that BITW replicates the index using a structure different from an ETF. For this reason, the representation between NAV and market price is not that accurate. If the NAV is the value of the underlying cryptos divided by the number of shares, and the market price is the price of the shares traded, the relationship between these two figures is not very linear. And I want to highlight this right away: being an OTC‑traded Trust (the shares trade on OTCQX, not the NYSE or Nasdaq) there is no daily creation/redemption mechanism , so it is subject to significant discounts or premiums relative to the NAV. In the past there have been discrepancies that were far too evident: such as premiums above 600% or discounts greater than 30%. Well, let''s just say I know more than one person who wouldn''t sleep at night faced with such swings. The Switch to an ETF Theoretically, the SEC had approved the switch to an ETF. This would have eliminated much of BITW''s structural issues. The problem? It then abruptly put the plan on hold. This calls BITW''s future into question: it''s not at all certain that the transformation will happen. There are no standards for ETFs on crypto like XRP and ADA, so how could BITW or GDLC make this conversion? Therefore, today, BITW has structural limits that an investor cannot ignore. The Selection Strategy It is a market‑weight fund and seeks to maintain an orderly structure, with transparent capping rules: for example, to reduce turnover, an asset is replaced only if another asset surpasses it by 10% for five consecutive days. As for the selection strategy, I must admit, it is actually very simple and transparent (more than other funds analyzed): it selects liquid cryptos (liquidity >1% of the market) it avoids stablecoins or memecoins and any asset under $0.01 for 30 consecutive days they must be custodial by regulated third parties (e.g., Coinbase Custody, Fidelity Digital Assets…) Then there is a committee in place, which can remove an asset or an exchange on the same day in case of extraordinary events (hacks, legal issues, frauds). The same committee can claim hard forks, airdrops, staking rewards (even though these are not considered in the default index calculation). The result is this holding distribution. Bitcoin 74.4% Ethereum 14.1% XRP 5.9% Solana 3.1% Cardano 0.9% SUI 0.4% ChainLink 0.4% Avalanche 0.3% Litecoin 0.3% Polkadot 0.2% What Should Make You Think There is an overexposure to Bitcoin compared to its dominance. And the question I ask myself as an investor is: is it worth getting exposure to such a complex fund just for less than 30% diversification in altcoins? In fact, considering that ETH covers 14%, we are talking about a concrete exposure to coins not accessible through ETFs of only 12%. Let''s look at it with the numbers: BITW - Holding distribution (Author) BITW or a BTC/ETH Portfolio? First of all, BITW has an expense ratio 16 times higher than BTC (2.5% vs 0.15%). So, I would expect BITW to deliver alpha compared to Bitcoin, or at least hedging power. And here''s the first conflicting clue: BITW has a beta of 0.98 to BTC. This already rules out the idea that altcoins (at least that small percentage) manage to hedge Bitcoin. Regarding outperformance, it can be debated: today, on short timeframes (during bull runs) there is alpha.

2025-07-28 09:40:44+00:00,Vitalik Buterin Explains How Ethereum Will Reach Millions Without Going Centralized,"The post Vitalik Buterin Explains How Ethereum Will Reach Millions Without Going Centralized appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has been gaining momentum lately, and not just in price. As the crypto market heats up, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently shared his thoughts on how Ethereum can grow bigger without losing what makes it special. With new tech upgrades and more real-world use, Ethereum is finally getting closer to living up to its full potential. Time to “make ETH great again”. Here’s the plan! The Two Pillars: Scalability and Decentralisation In a recent podcast , Buterin shared two core goals that Ethereum must balance when he was asked, “How do we make Ethereum great again?” First, massive real-world usage. He stressed that Ethereum needs to scale and provide a good user experience so that millions of people can use it. That means improving scalability and user experience so that the network is fast, affordable, and easy to use. And secondly, sovereign decentralization . He believes Ethereum must stay truly different from centralized systems by being neutral, resistant to censorship, and easy for anyone to verify. To support this, Ethereum is already rolling out major technical upgrades. Technologies like zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups and stateless clients are being adopted so that powerful nodes can process data while allowing everyone else to verify it more easily. Interesting Upgrades to Ethereum’s Tech Stack Thanks to Layer 2 networks, Ethereum can already process hundreds of transactions per second. But it won’t stop there. The upcoming “Pectra” upgrade is expected to significantly increase transaction throughput, potentially reaching thousands of transactions per second. By 2026, Buterin believes the main Ethereum network could become ten times faster than it is today, making it a much stronger foundation for global adoption. DeFi is Getting Safer and Stronger Vitalik admits that in the past, recommending DeFi to average users was not responsible, as the risk of losing 100% of your money from bugs or hacks was too high. However, he also points out that the ecosystem has matured. Data shows that such incidents are becoming less common, especially among mature protocols. At the same time, user safety is improving with tools like social recovery wallets, multisig setups, and account abstraction, making it easier for regular users to manage their assets more securely. ETH Leads the Market Rally With strong fundamentals, Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin, gaining over 60% this month.

The post Vitalik Buterin Explains How Ethereum Will Reach Millions Without Going Centralized appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has been gaining momentum lately, and not just in price. As the crypto market heats up, Ethereum co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, recently shared his thoughts on how Ethereum can grow bigger without losing what makes it special. With new tech upgrades and more real-world use, Ethereum is finally getting closer to living up to its full potential. Time to “make ETH great again”. Here’s the plan! The Two Pillars: Scalability and Decentralisation In a recent podcast , Buterin shared two core goals that Ethereum must balance when he was asked, “How do we make Ethereum great again?” First, massive real-world usage. He stressed that Ethereum needs to scale and provide a good user experience so that millions of people can use it. That means improving scalability and user experience so that the network is fast, affordable, and easy to use. And secondly, sovereign decentralization . He believes Ethereum must stay truly different from centralized systems by being neutral, resistant to censorship, and easy for anyone to verify. To support this, Ethereum is already rolling out major technical upgrades. Technologies like zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups and stateless clients are being adopted so that powerful nodes can process data while allowing everyone else to verify it more easily. Interesting Upgrades to Ethereum’s Tech Stack Thanks to Layer 2 networks, Ethereum can already process hundreds of transactions per second. But it won’t stop there. The upcoming “Pectra” upgrade is expected to significantly increase transaction throughput, potentially reaching thousands of transactions per second. By 2026, Buterin believes the main Ethereum network could become ten times faster than it is today, making it a much stronger foundation for global adoption. DeFi is Getting Safer and Stronger Vitalik admits that in the past, recommending DeFi to average users was not responsible, as the risk of losing 100% of your money from bugs or hacks was too high. However, he also points out that the ecosystem has matured. Data shows that such incidents are becoming less common, especially among mature protocols. At the same time, user safety is improving with tools like social recovery wallets, multisig setups, and account abstraction, making it easier for regular users to manage their assets more securely. ETH Leads the Market Rally With strong fundamentals, Ethereum continues to outperform Bitcoin, gaining over 60% this month. It is currently trading at $3,890, up 3% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of over $34 million. Despite the latest rally, it remains 20% below its all-time high of $4,891."

This move, directly impacting Bithumb lending services , signals a strategic shift towards enhancing stability and streamlining its product portfolio. For users and market observers alike, understanding this crucial transformation is key to navigating the evolving world of decentralized finance. Bithumb’s strategic move towards a more stable financial ecosystem. Bithumb Lending Services Undergo Crucial Transformation: What You Need to Know What’s Happening with Bithumb Lending Services? Bithumb has officially declared its intention to discontinue its existing Bithumb lending services . This cessation is scheduled for July 29, 2024. The exchange’s announcement, made via its official website, clarifies that these services will not simply vanish but will instead be consolidated into its existing coin rental service. The primary objective behind this consolidation is to provide users with more stable and robust offerings in the long run. This decision marks a notable pivot for Bithumb, an exchange that has long been a cornerstone of the South Korean crypto market. For years, crypto lending platforms have offered users the opportunity to earn passive income by lending out their digital assets, often for attractive yields. However, this model has also faced scrutiny and challenges, particularly concerning market volatility and regulatory compliance. Bithumb’s move reflects a broader trend within the industry to adapt and evolve in response to these pressures. Why the Shift? Understanding Bithumb’s Strategic Move The decision to cease Bithumb lending services and pivot to coin rental is not arbitrary; it’s a calculated strategic maneuver driven by several factors aimed at bolstering the exchange’s stability and user confidence. Understanding these underlying reasons is essential for grasping the significance of Bithumb’s action: Enhanced Stability and Risk Mitigation: Traditional crypto lending, while lucrative, often involves higher risks associated with borrower defaults, fluctuating collateral values, and smart contract vulnerabilities. By consolidating into a coin rental model, Bithumb aims to reduce its exposure to these risks, offering a more predictable and secure environment for both the exchange and its users. This aligns with a global trend towards more regulated and stable financial products in the crypto space. Regulatory Compliance and Clarity: South Korea has one of the most stringent regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrency exchanges globally. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) and other bodies continuously refine rules pertaining to digital asset services. Moving away from a direct lending model, which can sometimes blur lines with traditional financial services, toward a rental model might offer greater regulatory clarity and reduce potential compliance burdens for Bithumb. This proactive step helps Bithumb align more closely with evolving legal requirements and secure its operational longevity. Streamlined Product Offerings: Simplifying and consolidating services can lead to a more efficient operational structure. By focusing resources on a single, unified coin rental service, Bithumb can dedicate more efforts to improving its core offerings, enhancing user experience, and ensuring the reliability of its platform. This streamlining can lead to better service quality and reduced complexity for users. Market Adaptation and User Protection: The crypto market is dynamic. Lessons learned from past market downturns and incidents involving lending platforms (e.g., Celsius, BlockFi) have highlighted the need for greater transparency and robust risk management. Bithumb’s shift is a response to these market realities, prioritizing user protection by offering a service model that inherently carries different risk profiles and potentially more straightforward mechanics. This strategic realignment underscores Bithumb’s commitment to long-term sustainability and its proactive approach to adapting within a rapidly maturing industry. It’s a testament to the exchange’s efforts to provide a secure and compliant environment for its users. Coin Rental vs. Lending: Decoding the Differences for Users For many users, the terms “lending” and “rental” might seem interchangeable in the context of digital assets. However, there are fundamental distinctions that define their operational mechanics, risk profiles, and regulatory implications.

However, with major U.S. crypto policy reports due July 30, the flagship digital asset could still surprise us this week. Further complicating the situation, President Trump’s recent announcement of a new trade framework with the European Union (EU) covered tariff cuts on European imports, lowering political and commercial uncertainty and potentially changing how investors see safe-haven assets such as Bitcoin. To figure out where the BTC price might be by August 1 given all the changes in the market, Finbold’s AI price prediction tool relied on three machine learning models ( GPT-4o , Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Grok 2 Vision) and a suite of technical indicators, including moving average convergence divergence ( MACD ), relative strength index ( RSI ), stochastic oscillators, and 50-day moving averages. AI predicts BTC price According to the collective efforts of the three machine learning models, the average BTC price on August 1, the end of this week will be $119.833, implying a modest 0.7% upside from its current price of $119,003. AI price prediction for BTC. Source: Finbold Claude 3.5 Sonnet was the most bullish with a Bitcoin forecast of $121,500 (+2.1%). GPT-4o was also optimistic, with a BTC target price of $120,500 (+1.26%). Grok 2 Vision, however, leaned more bearish , predicting a price of $117,500 (-1.26%). From a technical point of view, it appears as if Grok was justified in its prediction. We note, for example, that the RSI fell from 75 to 62 in the past two weeks, suggesting a weakening bullish momentum.

2025-07-28 09:57:10+00:00,Senate Democrats Question Housing Agency Over Crypto in Mortgage Plans,"A group of Senate Democrats is demanding answers from the head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) over a controversial move to consider crypto assets in mortgage assessments. Key Takeaways: Senate Democrats are pressing FHFA for clarity on plans to include crypto in mortgage assessments. Lawmakers warn the move could pose financial risks due to crypto’s volatility and fraud exposure. Concerns over potential conflicts of interest and lack of transparency are central to the probe. In a letter sent Friday , five senators led by Jeff Merkley raised concerns about FHFA Director William Pulte’s recent directive instructing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to explore how crypto holdings could factor into mortgage risk evaluations without being converted into US dollars. The letter, co-signed by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, Mazie Hirono, and Bernie Sanders, calls for a detailed explanation by August 7. “We urge you to fully assess the potential risks and benefits of your order and its implications for the U.S. housing market and financial system,” the senators wrote. FHFA Rules Require Crypto to Be Converted Before Mortgage Use The FHFA has overseen Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac since the 2008 financial crisis, when both institutions were placed under federal conservatorship. Under current policy, crypto holdings must be liquidated into fiat before being considered in mortgage applications. Pulte’s order, however, signals a possible shift. The senators say such a move “could introduce unnecessary risks to consumers and pose serious safety and soundness concerns for the U.S. housing and financial markets.” They also warned that crypto’s volatility and history of liquidity issues could jeopardize borrowers’ ability to repay loans. “Borrowers may not be able to exit a crypto position and convert to cash at a price that would allow them to buffer against risk of mortgage default,” they wrote. JUST IN: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been ordered by the FHFA to consider crypto as a mortgage asset. pic.twitter.com/bPkd2EXAJn — CryptosRus (@CryptosR_Us) June 25, 2025 Beyond market risk, the senators cited concerns over scams, cyberattacks, and theft, which they say leave homeowners “vulnerable to losing their crypto assets with little hope of recovery.” The letter also raised potential ethical concerns. “We are concerned about how the FHFA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac will prevent conflicts of interest,” the lawmakers stated, pointing to former President Donald Trump and his family’s involvement in multiple crypto ventures. The Trumps reportedly have connections to trading platforms , stablecoins, mining businesses, memecoins, and NFTs. The senators also took direct aim at Pulte, alleging a potential conflict due to his wife’s crypto holdings, which financial disclosures indicate could be worth up to $2 million. They argue that Pulte’s dual role as FHFA Director and board chair of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is problematic. “You have stacked those boards with industry allies,” the letter said. Senators Slam FHFA for Lack of Clarity on Crypto Mortgage Order The lawmakers criticized the lack of transparency surrounding the order, stating it “includes no information on how Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would develop a proposal” or how the FHFA would assess risks or collect feedback. They referenced the 2023 banking crisis , where crypto exposure contributed to the collapse of three banks, as a cautionary tale. They also noted that in 2021, Fannie Mae concluded that crypto use for deposits, payments, or collateral was the “least appealing application” of blockchain. The senators asked Pulte to provide internal communications related to the order, details on the approval process, and information on how he plans to address potential conflicts of interest.

2025-07-28 10:00:34+00:00,60% Of Americans Uncomfortable With Crypto More Than They Understand It—Study,"About 14% of US adults report owning Bitcoin or another type of crypto today. That’s roughly one in seven people. Few others plan to jump in soon. Just 4% say they’ll probably buy it in the near future. Most Americans aren’t interested. A solid 60% say they have no plans to ever buy crypto. Only 6% are unsure or unfamiliar with the idea. Crypto Ownership Skews Young According to a June 2–15 Gallup survey , men under 50 lead the way with a 25% ownership rate. Older men trail at 12%, while women aged 18 to 49 come in at 8%. Women 50 and older sit at 9%. College graduates and upper‑income adults each report 19% ownership. Conservatives are at 18%. Seniors and lower‑income earners fall to 7% and 9%, respectively. These gaps show that digital currency is concentrated among certain groups. Interest In Crypto Remains Limited Familiarity doesn’t seem to help much. Almost everyone—95%—has heard of crypto. But only 35% say they know something about it. A clear 60% say they’ve heard of it but don’t know much. About 55% call it “very risky,” and 32% say “somewhat risky.” Even among current owners, 42% see it as very risky. Among those with no interest in buying, that number jumps to 72%. Politics plays a part here too. Democrats rate crypto as very risky at 66%, liberals at 71%, while Republicans and conservatives both land at 45%. Regulatory Clarity Could Help Based on reports, the poll wrapped up just before US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act on Friday. That new law aims to set clear rules for some types of crypto. It may ease worries over time. Right now, only 4% of adults name crypto as the best long‑term investment. By contrast, about 60% own stocks or real estate. Among investors—defined as people with $10,000 or more in stocks, bonds or mutual funds—ownership jumped from 2% in 2018 to 6% in 2021, and now sits at 17%. Yet 64% of these investors still say they’d never own crypto , up from 60% in 2021 but down from 72% in 2018. For now, crypto stays on the fringes. Younger men, higher earners and certain political groups make up most of the base. Many others will likely watch from the sidelines until they see clearer rules, better safety nets and solid returns. In the meantime, the market waits to see if broader interest will ever follow.

Yet 64% of these investors still say they’d never own crypto , up from 60% in 2021 but down from 72% in 2018. For now, crypto stays on the fringes. Younger men, higher earners and certain political groups make up most of the base. Many others will likely watch from the sidelines until they see clearer rules, better safety nets and solid returns. In the meantime, the market waits to see if broader interest will ever follow. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"
2025-07-28 10:03:54+00:00,XRP Giant Just Launched a $11.4M Bullish Position at $3.29. Is Something Big Coming?,"A recent tweet by crypto enthusiast Radar has drawn attention to the notable action of an XRP whale who bet on a continued rally from current prices. According to the post, a whale wallet identified by the address prefix 0x2ef7…e6 initiated a significant long position on XRP worth $11.44 million at a price of $3.2979. This trade was recorded at 06:37, as seen in a data chart labeled “Latest Whale Activity,” which Radar included in the post. The whale’s action was marked as an “Open Long,” indicating an expectation that the price of XRP will increase from the current entry point. The sheer size of the position, which exceeds $11 million, has generated attention from market observers, especially as the entry price appears well above recent average market prices for XRP, which have remained significantly below the $3.29 level for an extended period. This has led to scrutiny about the legitimacy of the price feed or the source of the trade execution data. ALERT: #XRP GIANT JUST LAUNCHED A $11.4M BULLISH POSITION AT $3.29. WHAT’S HIS INSIDE SCOOP?? pic.twitter.com/F7Eggmy4B0 — Radar (@raderevaluate) July 28, 2025 Questions Raised About Price Accuracy and Timing Radar’s post did not include speculation, but the accompanying image reveals other high-value trades on Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) , and HYPE, with comparatively smaller positions. What stands out in the list is the XRP trade, both for its size and the recorded price. The data shows the whale entering at $3.2979. This price discrepancy has led to speculation about whether this trade occurred on a derivative platform, was the result of thin order book conditions, or potentially reflects an off-market agreement. Regardless of the mechanism, some XRP followers interpret the trade as an aggressive bullish signal.

A reply by an X user, tschando, stated , “Perhaps only an idiot with a lot of money,” suggesting disbelief that any rational person would open such a large long position at that price point unless they possessed specific knowledge unavailable to the general public. Radar’s post included the statement: “ALERT: XRP GIANT JUST LAUNCHED A $11.4M BULLISH POSITION AT $3.29. WHAT’S HIS INSIDE SCOOP??” suggesting curiosity about whether the whale might be acting on private knowledge or an upcoming market development that has not yet been publicly disclosed. However, no evidence was provided to support such a conclusion. Whale Activity Tracking Across Multiple Assets The image used in Radar’s tweet comes from a real-time monitoring tool that tracks whale activity across various digital assets. Other transactions in the chart show long and short positions on BTC, ETH, and HYPE, but none rival the XRP trade in size or price irregularity. Notably, an Ethereum long position worth $7.87 million at $3,931.24 was also recorded shortly before the XRP trade. The overall context raises questions about the nature of the trading platform and the source of pricing used for this data. If confirmed accurate, the XRP whale’s move could reflect either an isolated trading event with unique circumstances or early positioning ahead of a potential shift in market sentiment.

Two Possible Scenarios For BTC! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin ended last week in a strong way . But some smart traders are warning that it might be a trick. A popular crypto trader named KillaXBT says that Bitcoin may be getting ready to move in a way that fools both buyers and sellers. It could drop first to scare people, and then go up. Or it could rise fast and then fall. He also points to a price gap near $117,000, which could act like a magnet. Let’s break it down. Last Week’s Moves Gave Early Clues Before this week even begin, KillaXBT had already posted two likely ideas for Bitcoin’s path. In the first idea, he expected Bitcoin to open strong, dip slightly near $116,000, and then bounce higher. Meanwhile, in the second idea, Bitcoin would fall even deeper, around $114,800, take out weak hands, and then bounce up hard. Out of the two, KillaXBT said the first idea was more likely. And last week, Bitcoin did dip to around $115,000, suggesting that the trap might have already happened. However, he also gave a warning: if Bitcoin fails to stay above recent lows, it could fall deeper, into the $112,000–$113,800 zone. That risk is still on the table. Watching the $117K Price Gap Last week’s dip to $115,800 was not just a random drop. According to KillaXBT, it was a smart “liquidity hunt”—a trick move to remove seller from the market before heading up again. For this week, the focus is on a key price gap near $117,316, which is the CME gap. KillaXBT believes this level could pull the price back like a magnet. So even if the price rises for a bit, it might return to this level to “fill the gap.” This Week: Two Big Scenarios Again Keeping things in mind KillaXBT shared a two key possible scenario for this week for bitcoin. His first scenario suggests Bitcoin might dip early in the week to form a higher low, then bounces back strongly. This move would shake out late buyers and set up a clean path for a bigger upward move. $BTC | Weekly Analysis Report Currently, BTC closed the weekly candle strongly, and the CME gap aligns closely with the previous weekly open.

This means people buying late might get stuck if the price suddenly drops. KillaXBT points to a danger zone between $119,300–$119,700.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the crypto analytics platform Altcoin Vector says that leverage risk is building within the second-largest digital asset by market cap despite ETH’s most recent price rise being backed by the spot market and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “ETH Futures OI (open interest) just hit a new ATH (all-time high) – double since May – and price is climbing with it. Unlike late 2024, this rise is backed by ETF inflows and spot momentum, but… OI at historic levels is a double-edged sword. Conviction is back, but leverage risk is building.” Source: Altcoin Vector/X Ethereum is trading for $3,771 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day. Moving on to Solana ( SOL ) challenger Sui ( SUI ), Altcoin Vector says that the layer-1 chain looks like it’s picking up momentum that could lead it to outperform Bitcoin ( BTC ) en route to a $5 price tag and beyond. “ETH is leading, even outpacing BTC – but this phase of rotation is about spotting alts that don’t just catch up… they outperform. SUI fits that bill. High-beta, strong trader interest, and just pumped +10% in 24h. Momentum is awakening. Impulse hasn’t fully kicked in yet – when it does, $5 target is just the beginning.” Source: Altcoin Vector/X SUI is trading for $4.22 at time of writing, a 5.2% increase on the day. Concluding its analysis with the top crypto asset by market cap, Altcoin Vector says that BTC’s latest dip shouldn’t be a concern. “Bitcoin’s drop isn’t a breakdown, it’s a healthy correction. Structure remains bullish. Optimal signal was cooling but now shows the first signs of recovering momentum. BTC is holding above support, though we could still test $112,500. Momentum paused, but trend is intact.” Source: Altcoin Vector/X BTC is trading for $119,503 at time of writing, a fractional increase during the last 24 hours.

This marks the first time a major Japanese credit card rewards program allows direct point-to-crypto conversion. The program officially launched on July 8, 2025, and reflects SBI Holdings’ growing push to integrate XRP into everyday finance. BREAKING NEWS: Japan’s Aplus credit card now turns reward points into crypto; including XRP, ETH, and BTC. BOOOOOOM! #XRP #RLUSD #XRPETF pic.twitter.com/yxiZARVVlN — Kenny Nguyen (@mrnguyen007) July 20, 2025 Real-World Use Case Gives XRP a Boost For every 200 yen spent with an Aplus credit card, users earn 1 point. Once they collect 2,100 points, worth just over 2,000 yen (roughly $13–$15), they can redeem them for XRP, BTC, or ETH via the SBI VC Trade platform. This bridges daily spending with digital assets, giving mainstream users easy, cash-free exposure to the crypto market . Moreover, XRP isn’t just any random token in the changing digital finance. SBI has backed it for years, using it for fast, low-cost payments and listing it first on its crypto exchange in 2018. Now, with Aplus letting users earn XRP through credit card points, SBI is blending everyday finance with blockchain. It’s a clear step toward making crypto more mainstream in Japan, and it might push other Asian banks to follow suit. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will XRP Price Hit ATH This Week? , Crypto for the Curious-No Cash, No Risk While the point-to-crypto value is modest, the program makes it easier for crypto-curious consumers to dip their toes in the digital asset world without financial risk. It’s ideal for beginners or cautious users who want to explore crypto through familiar systems like credit card points. This development echoes similar global trends, with major players like Mastercard and Amex offering crypto rewards through partners like Coinbase and BlockFi. However, Japan’s Aplus program stands out thanks to clear regulatory backing by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), which ensures consumer protection and regulatory compliance. On the Downside… Though the initiative is exciting, it comes with a few strings. The crypto redemption value is relatively small, asset management is the user’s responsibility, and taxes may apply if the redeemed crypto appreciates. Also, the rules around how frequently points can be converted are still unclear, meaning the long-term appeal will depend on how the program evolves. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This strategic move sees the company substantially increase its Bitcoin holdings, signaling a robust commitment to integrating cryptocurrency into its treasury management strategy. But what does this mean for Sequans, and for the broader corporate adoption of Bitcoin? The Latest Chapter in Sequans’ Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Sequans Communications recently announced a major expansion of its Bitcoin reserves, acquiring an additional 755 BTC for a hefty $88.5 million. This purchase, as detailed in a Newsfile press release, was executed at an average price of $117,296 per Bitcoin. This latest transaction brings Sequans’ total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 3,072 BTC as of July 25. The funding for this substantial purchase was sourced from the proceeds of a $380 million convertible note offering, highlighting a deliberate financial strategy to bolster the company’s digital asset portfolio. This isn’t just a one-off event; it’s part of a calculated approach. For a company primarily focused on IoT technology, this significant investment in Bitcoin raises interesting questions about future corporate finance trends. It suggests a growing confidence in Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a viable component of a corporate balance sheet. Why Are Companies Like Sequans Making a Bitcoin Acquisition? The decision by a tech company like Sequans to make such a substantial Sequans Bitcoin acquisition is multifaceted. Several factors typically drive companies to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies: Inflation Hedge: In an economic climate marked by inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets. Store of Value: Many proponents believe Bitcoin serves as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold. Companies may hold Bitcoin to preserve purchasing power over the long term. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can provide diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, potentially enhancing overall portfolio resilience. Future-Proofing: As the digital economy evolves, holding digital assets like Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking strategy, positioning the company at the forefront of financial innovation. Investor Appeal: For some companies, holding Bitcoin can also appeal to a new segment of investors who are bullish on cryptocurrencies and the broader digital asset space. Decoding the Numbers: What Does $117,296 Per Bitcoin Imply? The average purchase price of $117,296 per Bitcoin is a crucial detail. This figure provides insight into the market conditions during which Sequans made its acquisition. It reflects a specific valuation point and underscores the company’s willingness to invest heavily even at what might be considered a premium price by some. This level of investment indicates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, despite its notorious price volatility. To put this into perspective, here’s a simplified look at the company’s holdings: Metric Details Latest Purchase (BTC) 755 BTC Latest Purchase (USD) $88.5 million Average Price Per BTC (Latest) $117,296 Total BTC Holdings (as of July 25) 3,072 BTC Funding Source $380 million convertible note offering This significant outlay highlights the scale of conviction Sequans holds regarding Bitcoin’s role in its financial future. The decision to use proceeds from a convertible note offering further emphasizes a strategic, rather than speculative, approach to this Sequans Bitcoin acquisition . Navigating the Challenges: Risks of Corporate Bitcoin Holdings While the benefits of a Sequans Bitcoin acquisition can be compelling, it’s also important to acknowledge the inherent challenges and risks involved in holding a volatile asset like Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet: Price Volatility: Bitcoin is known for its dramatic price swings, which can significantly impact a company’s financial statements. Large unrealized gains or losses can affect investor perception and financial reporting. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in regulations could impact the legality, taxation, or liquidity of Bitcoin holdings.

The latest addition pushes its total holdings to 17,132 BTC, which is worth more than $2 billion. Metaplanet Adds 780 BTC In an update shared by Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich, the company disclosed a remarkable year-to-date (YTD) Bitcoin yield of 449.7% for 2025. The latest development came less than a month ago, when it purchased 797 BTC. This buying spree aligns with the Tokyo-listed firm’s revised “555 Million Plan,” which replaced its previous 21,000 BTC target for 2026. Under the new roadmap, the firm aims to hit 100,000 BTC by the end of this year and scale up to 210,000 BTC by 2027. It was in April 2024 that Metaplanet first embraced its Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Since then, the company has aggressively scooped up the digital asset, earning the moniker “Japanese MicroStrategy.” Metaplanet’s Bitcoin-focused strategy paid off in the second quarter as revenue reached 1.1 billion yen (which is around $7.6 million. This represents a 42.4% year-over-year jump, according to its latest quarterly report released earlier this month. Just as Metaplanet ramps up its Bitcoin reserves, SharpLink Gaming is gaining momentum in the Ethereum market. SharpLink Acquires 77,210 ETH The Nasdaq-listed firm has made a fresh purchase of 77,210 ETH, estimated to be around $295 million. In its latest update, Lookonchain revealed that the move brings the total Ether holdings of the company to over 438,000 ETH, worth more than $1.7 billion, which positions SharpLink as the second-largest corporate holder of ETH after Bitmine Immersion Tech. Interestingly, most of the newly acquired ETH has already been staked. The aggressive expansion comes on the heels of a leadership shakeup, as former BlackRock executive Joseph Chalom stepped in as co-CEO. Data from Yahoo Finance reported that Sharplink closed at $21.99 on July 25, with a 5.7% decline for the day. The stock shed $1.33 during regular trading hours.

The ETF is best suited for investors with a bullish Bitcoin outlook and a very high-risk tolerance, given its leveraged and derivative-based structure. Bitcoin recently reached an all-time high just below $123k as pro-crypto regulation -- the GENIUS Act -- changed investor sentiment for the better. MSTY has delivered strong NAV returns since inception, but income distributions are volatile and upside is capped due to the covered call approach. While recent pro-crypto regulation and Bitcoin price surges are positives, MSTY is only appropriate for those willing to accept significant risk and potential underperformance if the crypto market corrects. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF ( MSTY ) is a potentially attractive investment product for investors that have a favorable view on cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), and that want to monetize a synthetic long position in Bitcoin investor Strategy ( MSTR ). Strategy is the biggest corporate owner of Bitcoin in the world and with the cryptocurrency market recently receiving favorable stimulus from the GENIUS Act, the Bitcoin price has reached new all-time highs. A yield-oriented position in the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF could make sense for investors that understand the risks of an investment in MSTY and that have a very high tolerance when it comes to taking risk in their portfolios. Data by YCharts Previous Rating I have no previous coverage on the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, but up-graded Strategy to hold in my last work in June: Bitcoin Recovery Creates Less Risk . At the time of my last coverage, Strategy owned more than 580,000 Bitcoins which was equal to about 3% of the outstanding Bitcoin supply. Further, cryptocurrencies made a big comeback lately on the back of favorable stablecoin regulation -- the GENIUS Act -- which creates the first regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers. This move has sparked optimism in the cryptocurrency market, causing Bitcoin to grapple with a price of ~$123,000 for the first time ever. Strong NAV Upside And High-Income Potential The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is a way for investors to turn a favorable view on Strategy into a high-yielding income plan. Since Strategy is basically a Bitcoin investor (although it has a software business as well), the company has been a primary vehicle for investors to get Bitcoin exposure. Fundamentally, Strategy itself is a leveraged way to invest in Bitcoin as the company is issuing both equity and debt (mostly 0% convertible senior notes) in order to finance Bitcoin purchases. As a result, Strategy has out-performed Bitcoin by a massive margin in recent years. Data by YCharts This YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF does not own shares of Strategy, however, but rather builds a synthetic long position through the use of derivatives. In addition to the synthetic position in Strategy, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF sells covered calls in order to generate recurring dividend income for investors. The YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF therefore allows investors to monetize a long position in Strategy through option income, but it is a high-yielding ETF that is likely only suitable to very high risk-takers. There are two sources of potential gains for investors that buy into MSTY: 1) A high annualized distribution yield that is currently standing at 132.5%, and 2) Potential NAV gains. The majority of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF''s are going to come from distributions... which are made monthly. In the trailing-twelve-month period, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF made $27.59 in cumulative distributions. The monthly distribution has fluctuated widely, however, so investors that depend on predictable income would likely not want to own this ultra-high-yield investment product. Data by YCharts Favorable stablecoin legislation recently catapulted the Bitcoin price to an all-time high just short of $123,000 and changed sentiment towards many other digital currencies as well. Stablecoins are a critical pillar of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, allowing investors to (relatively) safely park capital and move into and out of digital currencies easily and without high costs. The stablecoin market, which is a part of the broader cryptocurrency market, has boomed in recent years as well.

2025-07-28 10:57:30+00:00,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Correction Over? Here’s What Signals a New ATH,"Bitcoin recently flushed a key liquidity zone below the $116K mark, triggering a period of sideways consolidation. With the FOMC meeting scheduled for Wednesday, traders are bracing for a potentially significant price move driven by macroeconomic developments. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Bitcoin remains within a steep ascending price channel, recently triggering a sweep of significant sell-side liquidity just below the $116K level. This area was loaded with stop-losses and long liquidations, which were flushed as the market dipped. Despite a short-term rebound following the sweep, bullish momentum has yet to regain full strength, likely due to a spike in supply pressure following a historic whale transaction, where one of the oldest known wallets moved dormant BTC after years of inactivity. Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating between the ascending channel’s support at $114K and the ATH resistance around $123K. This range-bound behavior reflects market hesitation ahead of the FOMC meeting scheduled for Wednesday, which is expected to trigger a major volatility event based on the Fed’s rate policy decision. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, BTC’s corrective drop was absorbed near the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement zone around $115K, prompting a reversal. Moreover, the price action has broken above a bullish flag formation, signaling a potential continuation toward $123K if momentum sustains. However, this bullish setup is contingent upon upcoming macro developments. All eyes are now on Wednesday’s FOMC meeting, with traders awaiting confirmation of a rate cut or hawkish tone. Depending on the Fed’s stance, Bitcoin could either break above its ATH or revisit lower support zones. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets As Bitcoin continues to trade sideways without a decisive breakout, the behavior of large holders is raising eyebrows across the market. On July 25th, a notable spike in Binance Whale Inflows was recorded, with over $1.2 billion in cumulative BTC entering the exchange in a single day. This surge marks the largest 30-day inflow observed in recent months, signaling a major shift in market dynamics. This wave of inflows led to immediate short-term selling pressure, pushing Bitcoin down from the $120K resistance to the $115K–$116K support zone, where it currently consolidates. While retail inflows have been gradually rising, they pale in comparison to this whale activity, highlighting a significant imbalance in market supply. If buyers fail to absorb this wave of supply, further downside toward $110K becomes a likely scenario. However, should Bitcoin rebound from current support, a retest of $121K and potentially new all-time highs remain on the table. The post Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Correction Over?

2025-07-28 10:58:43+00:00,Crypto Scammers Waste 4K Hours & China Makes $12M Crypto Bust: Best Wallet Protects You,"Scammers will always find a way, especially in crypto, where regulation is often lacking and enforcement feels like a distant dream. So, how do you fight back? Simple. Beat them at their own game, waste their time, and watch them squirm. Kitboga Strikes Back A pseudonymous streamer known as Kitboga designed an effective and satisfying new weapon in the fight against crypto fraud: a fake Bitcoin ATM ‘maze.’ A popular tool for crypto scammers is to have victims deposit cash into a Bitcoin ATM; the machine will then produce the destination wallet address and transaction ID. Once the scammers have the newly converted Bitcoin, they can ignore the victim and move on. Bitcoin ATMs are surprisingly accessible – there are over 40K worldwide – and so are an easy tool for scammers to use. Kitboga has weaponized the ATM part of the scam and turned it against would-be scammers. He crafted a digital ‘maze’—a nightmare of customer service loops, endless hold queues, CAPTCHA, and AI-powered confusion. It’s like an evil bureaucrat’s dream: a twisted journey through digital hell, with a fake Bitcoin waiting at the end. Kitboga’s trap has wasted over 4,000 hours of scammers’ time. What started as comedic content has transformed into a real-time weapon against scams, gathering intel and frustrating fraudsters at every turn. Engineering the Maze When scammers demand victims deposit cash at Bitcoin ATMs, Kitboga counters with a Photoshopped receipt: a QR code linking to a fictional exchange and a hotline that leads victims (or, in this case, scammers) into a purpose‑built labyrinth. Once inside, attackers must solve tedious tasks in the guise of CAPTCHA or human verification: estimate the number of nuts in a bucket, gauge wave heights, or even play Derude’s ‘Sandstorm’ on a keyboard (as an added bonus, each attempt causes the CAPTCHA to speed up). Enter the wallet address incorrectly – and of course, it’s a fake, so it will automatically be incorrect – and Kitboga’s system triggers automated phone interactions where an AI will intentionally mishear digits, repeat prompt failures, and eventually trap the scammer in prolonged hold periods. Over the past year, the fake ATM has trapped about 500 scammers, occupying them for 3,953 hours, approximately 164 days. On average, each scammer spends nearly 3 hours in the maze, while the record stands at 156 hours; that’s more than six days. Six days in which the scammer wasn’t scamming someone else. More Than a Time Waster Kitboga isn’t merely playing games with scammers; he’s gathering actionable intelligence. Registering on the fake crypto exchange Kitboga set up requires scammers to enter their Bitcoin address, giving the team a growing database of known scam wallets. Some attackers inadvertently reveal video feeds or other identifiers. In collaboration with Kraken, crypto funds obtained by scammers have reportedly been frozen based on information from the maze. The fake ATM maze is Kitboga’s ‘second most effective tool,’ behind AI‑powered autodialers. His team is launching similar infinite‑maze tactics for other scam types, including gift card fraud and mailed‑cash schemes. Bitcoin ATM scams are nothing new—but their scale is increasing. In the first half of 2024, U.S. consumers lost nearly $65M to scams routed through ATMs; 2023 saw over $100M lost in crypto ATM scams. But like normal people, for fraudsters, time is money. Every minute spent in Kitboga’s maze is not spent scamming real victims – the maze even requires scammers on hold to respond with ridiculous phrases or risk losing their spot. Scambaiting isn’t the only tool in the arsenal – other entities, like Chinese law enforcement, are turning to different tools. Chinese Local Law Enforcement Step Up Beijing’s Haidian District People’s Procuratorate exposed an embezzlement-driven crypto laundering operation involving Kuaishou employees. The employees siphoned approximately ¥140M ($20M) via Bitcoin and mixers routed through at least eight overseas exchanges. Authorities recovered 92 BTC (¥89M, $11.7M) and successfully prosecuted eight insiders, issuing prison terms ranging from 3 to 14 years alongside financial penalties. China has some of the strictest anti-crypto policies in the world. That makes the potential gains from crypto scams even greater, though it elevates the risk. A prosecutor noted the case exhibits all the traits of modern digital-era corruption: Small-scale officials engaging in big fraud Crypto-aided money laundering Poor risk control within corporations Though China has banned crypto trading and mining, underground operations remain vibrant. Earlier investigations uncovered a $2.2B money laundering ring using OTC brokers, secret shell companies, and exchanges, often used to bypass China’s strict foreign exchange caps. In the end, what brought down the latest crypto scamming ring was dedicated local law enforcement, illustrating that the path forward to fight scams involves boots-on-the-ground in more than one w",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-scammers-waste-4k-hours-china-12m-bust-best-wallet/,BTC|ASIA|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|MINING,Cryptocurrency Market News,BTC,"Crypto Scammers Waste 4K Hours & China Makes $12M Crypto Bust: Best Wallet Protects You.

A prosecutor noted the case exhibits all the traits of modern digital-era corruption: Small-scale officials engaging in big fraud Crypto-aided money laundering Poor risk control within corporations Though China has banned crypto trading and mining, underground operations remain vibrant. Earlier investigations uncovered a $2.2B money laundering ring using OTC brokers, secret shell companies, and exchanges, often used to bypass China’s strict foreign exchange caps. In the end, what brought down the latest crypto scamming ring was dedicated local law enforcement, illustrating that the path forward to fight scams involves boots-on-the-ground in more than one w"

He explained: “If you were neutral on everything, in other words, you didn’t have a point of view, and you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio you would have, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin.” Dalio made it clear he still “strongly prefers” gold to Bitcoin, but acknowledges the case for both assets. He personally owns “some Bitcoin,” though he cautions that central banks are unlikely to adopt it due to privacy concerns and regulatory risk. Even so, Dalio underlines that the choice between gold and Bitcoin is personal, and it’s up to each investor to decide how they want to hedge against inflation, currency swings, and mounting U.S. debt. Dalio also warns that America will need to issue approximately $12 trillion in new debt over the next year, making the case for including alternative stores of value like gold and Bitcoin even stronger right now.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/dalio-recommends-15-in-bitcoin,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS,,BTC,"Dalio’s 15% Rule: Gold or Bitcoin?.

2025-07-28 11:00:44+00:00,Ripple Price Warning: XRP Could Tumble if This Crucial Support Cracks (Analysis),"Following Bitcoin’s record-breaking rally, Ripple (XRP) has experienced a notable uptrend in recent weeks, establishing a strong bullish market structure across both its USDT and BTC trading pairs. However, the current price action indicates a potential overextension, suggesting a short-term correction or consolidation phase may occur before further upside continuation. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair XRP has recently surpassed the significant $3.30 resistance level against USDT, extending a rally that began in early July. This bullish breakout was triggered by the price moving above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, which are now trending upward and forming a bullish crossover near the $2.40 area. These moving averages are likely to act as dynamic support in case of a deeper retracement. Despite the bullish momentum, XRP is showing early signs of rejection at the $3.30 level. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) entered the overbought zone but has since declined below 70, coinciding with the current price pullback. The $3.00 level is now serving as short-term support. If this level holds, it could provide a solid foundation for the next leg up. However, a break below $3.00 could trigger a more pronounced decline toward the $2.40 region, where the aforementioned moving averages converge. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC chart reflects a similar trend, with Ripple’s token surging from early July and breaking above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, both positioned near the 2,400 SAT level. This bullish move was met with resistance at 3,200 SAT, where the rally temporarily stalled. Currently, the market is retesting a bullish fair value gap near the 2,700 SAT area. If this zone provides support, it could serve as a launchpad for another attempt at the 3,200 SAT resistance, with potential for a breakout. Conversely, failure to hold above 2,700 SAT could open the door to a deeper correction, with downside targets around 2,400 SAT or possibly the key 2,000 SAT support level. Overall, while XRP’s trend remains bullish, short-term caution is warranted due to potential overbought conditions.

2025-07-28 11:07:42+00:00,CZ Binance’s Net Worth Hits $75B as BNB Token Breaks New ATH Above $850 – Richer Than Warren Buffett?,"Changpeng Zhao’s (CZ) net worth has surged to an estimated $75 billion following BNB’s breakthrough to a new all-time high of $857.18, positioning the Binance founder among the world’s wealthiest individuals. The cryptocurrency mogul owns approximately 64% of BNB’s circulating supply, equivalent to roughly 98 million tokens worth $83 billion at current prices. Combined with his 90% ownership stake in Binance, valued at $35 billion, CZ’s wealth has reached levels that challenge traditional billionaire rankings. CZ Surpasses Tech Giants But Trails Ultra-Wealthy Elite Forbes currently ranks CZ as the 23rd to 25th richest person globally, placing him close behind Facebook’s Zuckerberg ($245 billion), Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin ($150-160 billion each), and comparable to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer ($144 billion). Source: Forbes Similarly, CZ remains behind the ultra-wealthy elite, including Elon Musk ($400+ billion), Jeff Bezos ($200-240 billion), and Warren Buffett ($144 billion). To surpass Buffett, BNB would need to reach approximately $1,245, representing just a 45% increase from current levels. The milestone coincides with Bitcoin’s dominance falling 5.8% in one week to under 61% , marking the steepest decline since June 2022 as capital rotates into alternative cryptocurrencies. BNB’s surge has helped drive the Altseason Index to 51, approaching the 75 threshold that signals the official start of altseason. Path to Surpassing Global Wealth Elite Through BNB Price Targets Mathematical projections based on CZ’s estimated 98 million BNB holdings and $35 billion Binance equity stake reveal specific price targets needed to surpass the world’s wealthiest individuals. To surpass Jeff Bezos’s $240 billion fortune, BNB would need to double in value to approximately $2,328 per token. Surpassing Elon Musk’s $400 billion+ wealth requires BNB to reach $4,095, while overtaking Bernard Arnault’s $220 billion+ fortune demands $2,079 per token. These calculations assume Binance’s equity valuation remains stable at current estimates. Warren Buffett’s $140 billion net worth represents the most achievable target, requiring BNB to reach $1,245, a modest 45% increase from current levels. Given the volatility of cryptocurrency, this threshold could be crossed within weeks or months during favorable market conditions. CZ’s wealth composition differs dramatically from that of traditional billionaires, who typically hold diversified portfolios across stocks, real estate, and private companies. His concentrated exposure to BNB creates both massive upside potential and downside risk during market corrections. The Binance founder’s fortune has grown exponentially since BNB’s launch at $0.09611 in August 2017, representing gains exceeding 890,000%. This appreciation timeline surpasses even the most successful tech entrepreneurs’ wealth accumulation periods. Corporate Treasury Adoption Fuels BNB’s Institutional Validation Windtree Therapeutics secured $520 million in funding to build one of the largest corporate BNB treasuries, potentially becoming the first Nasdaq-listed company with direct BNB holdings.

The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 2.7% over the past 24 hours, but it still holds above $4 trillion, now standing at $4.03 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $148 billion, lower than the ~$220 billion level we’ve been seeing lately. TLDR: Crypto market cap holds above $4 trillion; The majority of the top 100 coins and all top 10 coins are green today; BTC trades at $118,976 and ETH at $3,886; BNB hits new ATH of $852; BTC could hit $132,000 soon and $150,000 by year-end; The probability of ETH hitting $6,000 by 25 December has more than quadrupled. US ETH spot ETFs hit the 16th inflow day in a row; US BTC spot ETFs record positive flows of $130.69 million; ’Expect a smoother climb for BTC, and a wilder ride for ETH’; Market sentiment is set firmly on the lower edge of the greed zone. Crypto Winners & Losers By the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have appreciated over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) increased by 0.6% in a day, now trading at $118,976. This is the second smallest increase today. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 2.8% and is now trading at $3,886. Tron (TRX) increased the least: 0.2% to the price of $0.3224.

Overall, the market keeps reacting to positive signals, including higher adoption, while defying negative factors, including macroeconomic pressures. Though not everyone agrees, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan argues that Bitcoin could break from its historical four-year cycle and post significant gains in 2026. “I broadly think we’re in for a good few years,” he said .

Source: Ledn He continues: “A corrective wave iv will likely follow as we see early profit takers come into play, and we will sell off to somewhere in the region of $120,000 before the rally into year-end to $136,000 to $142,000 to complete Wave 5.” Meanwhile, Nick Forster, Founder at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , argued that “Mike Novogratz’s $150,000 prediction isn’t some moonshot anymore.

The crypto market is up today, with most of the top 100 coins per market turning green. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 2.7% over the past 24 hours, but it still holds above $4 trillion, now standing at $4.03 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $148 billion, lower than the ~$220 billion level we’ve been seeing lately. TLDR: Crypto market cap holds above $4 trillion; The majority of the top 100 coins and all top 10 coins are green today; BTC trades at $118,976 and ETH at $3,886; BNB hits new ATH of $852; BTC could hit $132,000 soon and $150,000 by year-end; The probability of ETH hitting $6,000 by 25 December has more than quadrupled. US ETH spot ETFs hit the 16th inflow day in a row; US BTC spot ETFs record positive flows of $130.69 million; ’Expect a smoother climb for BTC, and a wilder ride for ETH’; Market sentiment is set firmly on the lower edge of the greed zone. Crypto Winners & Losers By the time of writing, all top 10 coins per market capitalization have appreciated over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) increased by 0.6% in a day, now trading at $118,976. This is the second smallest increase today. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 2.8% and is now trading at $3,886. Tron (TRX) increased the least: 0.2% to the price of $0.3224. On the other hand, Binance Coin (BNB) appreciated the most in this category. It’s up 6.6%, currently changing hands at $848. The coin surged to its new all-time high of $852 today. In the top 100 coins category, three coins recorded double-digit increases. SPX6900 (SPX) is the highest among these: it’s up 12.1% to $2.22. It’s followed by Optimism (OP) and Ethena (ENA) with 11.2% and 10.7% to $0.8133 and $0.6811, respectively. Fewer than 10 coins in this category are down. The highest drop among these is 5.9% by Curve DAO (CRV) , now trading at $1.02. Others are down 2.3% and less per coin. Overall, the market keeps reacting to positive signals, including higher adoption, while defying negative factors, including macroeconomic pressures. Though not everyone agrees, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan argues that Bitcoin could break from its historical four-year cycle and post significant gains in 2026. “I broadly think we’re in for a good few years,” he said . DID I HEAR SUPER CYCLE??? The four-year cycle is dead and adoption killed it. @Matt_Hougan says we''re going higher in 2026. Early profit takers will be left behind!!!

Source: Ledn He continues: “A corrective wave iv will likely follow as we see early profit takers come into play, and we will sell off to somewhere in the region of $120,000 before the rally into year-end to $136,000 to $142,000 to complete Wave 5.” Meanwhile, Nick Forster, Founder at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , argued that “Mike Novogratz’s $150,000 prediction isn’t some moonshot anymore. Options markets now imply a 52% chance of BTC hitting $150,000 by year-end.” “What’s even more interesting is the volatility differential: BTC’s implied December volatility is just 30%, while ETH’s is 60%.

Kiyosaki Warns of Market Crash Worse Than 1929 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Robert Kiyosaki , the best-selling author of Rich Dad Poor Dad , has warned that a massive financial crash may be just around the corner and says Bitcoin, along with gold and silver, could be the best protection. In a new tweet, Kiyosaki compared the current state of the U.S. economy to the period leading up to the 1929 Great Depression. He believes another crash, possibly worse than that historic collapse, is now possible. “We may be on the brink of another 1929 crash and another Great Depression,” he said. Debt, Money Printing, and a Failing System Kiyosaki blames the rising risk on two key problems: the U.S. government’s aggressive money printing and its fast-growing debt. “America’s debt is out of control. America is the world’s biggest debtor nation in history. You can only print money to pay your bills… for so long,” he wrote. He warned that most people are unaware of how serious the situation is, especially those relying on traditional retirement plans like 401(k)s or IRAs, which are often heavily invested in stocks. Why the Smart Money Is Moving Out of Stocks To back his point, Kiyosaki pointed out that well-known investors Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers have already sold most of their stocks and bonds. “They are both in cash or silver,” he noted. It’s a signal, Kiyosaki says, that the traditional stock market may no longer be the safest place to park wealth. Instead, he says he’s staying focused on three assets: gold, silver, and Bitcoin. However, Kiyosaki garners a lot of criticism from other analysts or market watchers who feel he might be a tad too “dramatic”. 1. No they didn''t 2. pic.twitter.com/gbUtNALQ5c — Mark McGrath (@MarkMcGrathCFP) July 28, 2025 A Word of Caution on ETFs In another tweet, Kiyosaki also commented on the growing popularity of ETFs, including Bitcoin ETFs. While he acknowledges they make investing easier, he warned they’re not the same as owning the real thing. “An ETF is like having a picture of a gun for personal defense,” he said. “Sometimes it’s best to have real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a gun.” In short, he believes owning physical or direct assets offers far more protection than holding paper exposure, especially if the financial system takes a hit. While Wall Street is focused on short-term gains, Kiyosaki is urging people to think long-term and consider what might actually hold value if the system breaks.

2025-07-28 11:25:52+00:00,Strategy STRC Stock Offering Legitimizes Bitcoin & Boosts Bitcoin Hyper,"Strategy (previously MicroStrategy) has launched a $2.521B Bitcoin-backed investment product so that investors can earn up to 9% annual returns. Named the ‘Stretch Preferred Stock’ (STRC), it doesn’t give investors direct exposure to $BTC. Instead, it uses the crypto’s strong historical performance to support steady, high-yield payouts. But as Bitcoin dives deeper into TradFi, the network is bound to face growing pressure to evolve. Even before this heightened demand, it struggles with limitations, like slow transactions and limited programmability. Thankfully, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will fix such woes. Once deployed in Q3 2025, the Layer 2 network promises to unlock critical utility for Bitcoin as the network continues to attract both DeFi and TradFi attention. STRC Tops Venture Capital as Largest US IPO Strategy is using its hefty $BTC treasury as a financial backbone to create a stable, income-generating product. And its attention is already unmatched. Given that the STRC has already raised $2.521B , it has quickly become the most extensive US initial public offering (IPO) of 2025 so far. It even outpaces prominent names like Venture Global and CoreWeave. All the proceeds made from the stock offering will go toward corporate needs, which involve snagging more $BTC. And it won’t be small amounts. Just days before the STRC’s launch, Strategy scooped up an additional 6,220 $BTC for $739.8M , pushing its total holdings to 607,770 $BTC (at the time of writing, it’s worth a whopping $72.27B) . The hype surrounding STRC not only shows growing interest in $BTC-backed investment products but signals Wall Street’s increasing interest in crypto-powered income strategies. STRC Stands Out With 9% Yield & SOFR Volatility Guardrails What boosts the stock’s appeal is that it’s designed to trade at $100 per share based on Bitcoin’s tendency to average out a 3-4% annual return. Plus, the fact that it offers monthly dividend payments starting at a 9% annualized rate. The payout isn’t fixed; it may fluctuate based on market conditions. However, Strategy is aware of such challenges, so has guardrails in place to protect investors from sudden or arbitrary drops. Any changes to the payout must follow a well-established interest rate called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) . As such, the company cannot simply lower it without justification. Suppose Strategy misses a payment, interest will accrue and be paid later. This ensures that investors still get paid what they’re owed – even if Strategy temporarily pauses monthly payouts. Moreover, once the shares are listed on the Nasdaq or NYSE, Strategy has the right to redeem them at $101 per share, including any unpaid dividends. Additionally, if the company undergoes any major changes, investors can request that Strategy buy back their shares at full value. Each of these features helps keep the stock price steady (at roughly $100), while offering higher returns than most short-term investments that you’d find in traditional finance. It also shifts the narrative around $BTC being a volatile asset to a productive store of value. Consequently, it’s a major win for #1 crypto (currently valued at a hefty $119K , up by over 10% compared to last month), as well as the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. But as Bitcoin moves deeper into TradFi, the network is bound to face growing pressure in order to evolve. But fear not: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is set to launch to extend the network’s capabilities. Bitcoin Hyper to Redefine Bitcoin’s Capabilities Bitcoin Hyper goes beyond being yet another Layer 2 network; it’s the infrastructure that’s highly necessary to update Bitcoin as it continues attracting unprecedented attention. Once launched in the coming months, it promises to solve the blockchain network’s most pressing challenges: slow transaction speeds, high fees, and the lack of native smart contracts. It’ll integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to make the network fast and inexpensive, similar to Solana. This upgrade will also unlock key features, including high-performance dApps, DeFi protocols, the launch of the best meme coins , and real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Considering that experts predict that 30% of the world’s financial assets could be tokenized by 2030 , Bitcoin Hyper is well-positioned to make Bitcoin a powerhouse in this rapidly evolving market alone. Notably, a Canonical Bridge is the foundation of the entire Layer 2 network. It’ll allow $BTC to flow seamlessly between the Layer 1 and Layer 2. This way, you’ll be able to tap into Bitcoin’s original security while relishing the speed and flexibility of a modern smart contract platform. The platform’s native token, $HYPER, powers the network through governance, cost-friendly gas fees, and staking rewards (of which are currently valued at a commendable 189% APY).

In a post on the social media platform X, Grogan says that based on his research, a “minimum” of 913,111 ETH, worth about $3.43 billion, has been lost forever due to user error. The lost coins represent about 0.76% of the supply of ETH, according to Grogan. Among the biggest losses was when the Web3 Foundation – a major crypto-supporting nonprofit – lost access to 306,276 ETH due to a bug in the Parity multisig wallet software. Grogan also notes that when accounting for Ethereum’s EIP-1559 burn mechanism, about $23.42 billion or around 5% of all ETH ever made has been permanently destroyed. And the number gets even bigger when considering the amount of ETH that aren’t necessarily gone forever, but likely inaccessible due to lost private keys. “To be clear, this $3.4 billion+ number significantly undershoots the actual lost/inaccessible ETH amount. It just covers instances where Ethereum is locked forever. For example, it doesn’t cover all lost private keys or things like Genesis wallets that have been forgotten.” At time of writing, ETH is trading at $3,869, up nearly 60% in the last month.

2025-07-28 11:56:27+00:00,Bitcoin Seeing Severe Exhaustion of Bullish Momentum,"This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin: Correction risks mount Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade directionless near $120,000 amid data from the Deribit-listed options showing a significant positive dealer gamma at the $120,000 and $120,500 strikes. When dealers have a positive gamma exposure, they buy low and sell high to rebalance their net exposure to neutral, inadvertently arresting volatility. The crucial support area between $116,000 and $117,000, validated by both price charts and on-chain activity , if breached, would likely pave the way for a retest of the May high just below $112,000. Conversely, a convincing move above $120,000 will likely bring record highs. That said, the case for an extended pullback looks strong, as the miniscule 0.12% green bar, confirmed on July 22 on the three-line break chart with daily configuration, indicates uptrend exhaustion. AI''s take: On a three-line break chart, where each bar signals a confirmed trend move, the minuscule 0.12% green bar on July 22 is a significant warning. It indicates that the strong uptrend is experiencing severe exhaustion of buying momentum, suggesting a potential imminent consolidation or reversal despite the overall bullish trend. Resistance: $120,000, $123,181. Support: $116,000-$117,000, $114,700, $111,965. Ether: Hits 7-Month Ether (ETH) has risen nearly 2% in the past 24 hours, hitting a seven-month high of $3,937 at one point, which invalidated the indecisive Doji signal from last week. The momentum, however, was short-lived, as prices quickly pulled back to $3,880 as of the time of writing, validating the 14-day RSI, which did not confirm the fresh multi-month high in prices, hinting at potential bearish divergence and an impending correction. The daily chart MACD histogram also teased a bearish cross, with on-chain fundamentals like Ethereum''s native fees and revenue failing to keep pace with the rising prices. The higher low of $3,510 established on Thursday remains key support, below which, the risk of an extended slide would increase. On the higher side, the $3,900-$4,100 is the key resistance range from 2024. AI''s take: The MACD is flashing an impending negative cross, signaling weakening bullish momentum, while the RSI shows bearish divergence, failing to confirm new price highs. These indicators collectively point to a loss of upward thrust, increasing downside risk. Resistance: $4,000, $4100, $4,382. Support: $3,770 (daily low), $3,510, $3,000. XRP: Retreats from support-turned-resistance XRP (XRP) has reversed the gains from the Asian session, retreating from near the former support-turned-resistance level at $3.35. The pullback appears to have legs, as the hourly chart''s RSI has violated the bullish trendline and the MACD histogram has crossed below zero, signaling a bearish shift in momentum. This structure favors a retest of the July 24 low of $2.96, below which, the focus would shift to the May high of $2.65. The tweezer top pattern on the weekly chart, characterized by consecutive candlesticks with highs at $3.65, also suggests a bearish shift in momentum. AI''s take: XRP''s impressive rally has been capped by a significant ""tweezer top"" candlestick pattern, a strong bearish reversal signal that warns of potential downside from its multi-year highs. Resistance: $3.35, $3.65, $4.00. Support: $2.96, $2.65, $2.44 (the 200-day SMA) Solana: Not out of the woods yet SOL''s (SOL) price has recovered to trade above the hourly chart Ichimoku cloud, establishing higher lows to suggest renewed upward momentum and a possible retest of $200, the upper end of the ascending channel. Still, we are not out of the woods yet, as the tweezer top formation at $205-$206 on the daily chart remains valid. Hence, a move below $184, the higher low, cannot be ruled out and will likely lead to an accelerated pullback to the 200-day SMA at $163. AI''s take: Solana''s impressive July rally has produced a ""Tweezer Top"" candlestick pattern at its peak, signaling a strong bearish reversal that suggests significant selling pressure has entered the market. Resistance: $205-$206, $218, $252.

2025-07-28 12:00:07+00:00,"Ethereum Is About To Breakout Of Massive Consolidation Toward $5,000","Crypto analyst BATMAN has revealed that Ethereum is primed to make a parabolic run to a new all-time high (ATH) of $5,000. The analyst also mentioned the first resistance that ETH needs to break to reach this psychological level. Ethereum Ready To Break Out And Reach $5,000 In an X post, BATMAN noted that Ethereum is ready to break out of a massive consolidation and rally towards $5,000. He stated that the first resistance is between $4,000 and $4,200. Once that is done, there is no resistance until between $4,800 and $5,000, which could spark this rally to the $5,000 psychological level. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000 The analyst declared that Ethereum is still in bullish territory and outperforming Bitcoin. As such, he believes any dips from here could be strong buy zones. Indeed, ETH is currently outperforming BTC. The former is up over 61% in the last 30 days while the latter is up just 11% during this period. It is also worth noting that Ethereum is already looking to reclaim the first resistance between $4,000 and $4,200. The largest altcoin by market just recently broke above $3,900 and is now looking to touch $4,000 for the first time since November last year. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also indicated that a parabolic move may be on the horizon for ETH. In an X post, he stated that the ETH/BTC chart is heading to the reload zone, which could spark a massive breakout for Ethereum. His accompanying chart showed that the altcoin could rally to between $7,300 and $8,700 on this move. This suggests that a rally to $5,000, as predicted by BATMAN, is unlikely to signal the top for ETH in this market cycle. ETH Dominance Also On The Rise In an X post, crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealed that Ethereum’s dominance is on the rise, increasing to around 12% for the first time in five years. He noted that the last time the ETH dominance reached 12% was exactly five years ago, in July 2020. With this latest increase, Rekt Capital stated that the altcoin’s dominance is now looking to reach as high as 14%. Related Reading: This Ethereum Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern Looks Similar To 2019-2020, Here’s What Happened Last Time This development is significant as it could usher in altcoin season, led by Ethereum. Blockchain Center data shows that the altcoin season index has surged recently to 47, although it still needs to touch 75 for it to be considered altcoin season. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto believes this should happen soon, especially with a golden cross forming on the ETH/BTC chart. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,900, up over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Crypto analyst BATMAN has revealed that Ethereum is primed to make a parabolic run to a new all-time high (ATH) of $5,000. The analyst also mentioned the first resistance that ETH needs to break to reach this psychological level. Ethereum Ready To Break Out And Reach $5,000 In an X post, BATMAN noted that Ethereum is ready to break out of a massive consolidation and rally towards $5,000. He stated that the first resistance is between $4,000 and $4,200. Once that is done, there is no resistance until between $4,800 and $5,000, which could spark this rally to the $5,000 psychological level. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000 The analyst declared that Ethereum is still in bullish territory and outperforming Bitcoin. As such, he believes any dips from here could be strong buy zones. Indeed, ETH is currently outperforming BTC. The former is up over 61% in the last 30 days while the latter is up just 11% during this period. It is also worth noting that Ethereum is already looking to reclaim the first resistance between $4,000 and $4,200. The largest altcoin by market just recently broke above $3,900 and is now looking to touch $4,000 for the first time since November last year. Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto also indicated that a parabolic move may be on the horizon for ETH. In an X post, he stated that the ETH/BTC chart is heading to the reload zone, which could spark a massive breakout for Ethereum. His accompanying chart showed that the altcoin could rally to between $7,300 and $8,700 on this move. This suggests that a rally to $5,000, as predicted by BATMAN, is unlikely to signal the top for ETH in this market cycle. ETH Dominance Also On The Rise In an X post, crypto analyst Rekt Capital revealed that Ethereum’s dominance is on the rise, increasing to around 12% for the first time in five years. He noted that the last time the ETH dominance reached 12% was exactly five years ago, in July 2020. With this latest increase, Rekt Capital stated that the altcoin’s dominance is now looking to reach as high as 14%.

2025-07-28 12:15:11+00:00,Bitcoin Investment: Convano’s Bold $10.1M Move Shakes Up Corporate Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment: Convano’s Bold $10.1M Move Shakes Up Corporate Strategy In a world where digital assets are increasingly reshaping traditional finance, some of the most intriguing shifts are coming from unexpected corners. Imagine a Japan-based nail salon operator making headlines not for its latest beauty trends, but for its substantial Bitcoin investment . This is precisely the story of Convano, a company that has just secured 1.5 billion yen (approximately $10.1 million) specifically to bolster its holdings in the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This move, as reported by @btcNLNico on X, follows a prior acquisition of around 80 BTC last week, signaling a clear and deliberate pivot towards digital assets. For many, this raises questions: Why would a nail salon dive so deeply into Bitcoin investment ? And what does this tell us about the evolving landscape of corporate finance? Convano’s Strategic Bitcoin Investment: A Closer Look Convano’s decision to raise a significant sum for additional Bitcoin purchases isn’t just a fleeting interest; it appears to be a well-thought-out strategic play. The company, primarily known for its nail salon operations, is now positioning itself within the volatile yet potentially lucrative cryptocurrency market. This latest fundraising round, amounting to $10.1 million, is earmarked directly for increasing their Bitcoin reserves. This follows their initial venture into the Bitcoin space with the purchase of roughly 80 BTC just a week prior. Such swift and substantial action suggests Convano views Bitcoin investment not as a speculative gamble, but as a legitimate treasury management strategy or a long-term value play. It reflects a growing confidence, even among non-traditional tech companies, in Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value or a hedge against economic uncertainties. Why Are Companies Embracing Bitcoin Investment? Convano isn’t an isolated case, though its industry might make it seem so. A growing number of corporations worldwide are exploring or actively engaging in Bitcoin investment . But what drives this trend? Several factors contribute to this paradigm shift: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is often touted as ‘digital gold.’ Its finite supply of 21 million coins makes it attractive to companies looking to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Diversification of Treasury Reserves: Traditional corporate treasury strategies often involve holding cash, bonds, or other low-yield assets. Adding Bitcoin offers a new avenue for diversification, potentially enhancing overall portfolio returns, albeit with higher risk. Future-Proofing and Innovation: Companies investing in Bitcoin signal an embrace of emerging technologies and a forward-thinking approach. It can attract talent, appeal to tech-savvy customers, and position the company at the forefront of digital transformation. Potential for Significant Returns: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically offered substantial returns over longer periods, far outperforming traditional assets. For companies with a higher risk tolerance and long-term vision, this potential upside is a major draw. Public Perception and Brand Image: For some, adopting Bitcoin can be a statement. It aligns the company with innovation and a decentralized future, potentially boosting brand appeal among certain demographics. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Investment While the allure of Bitcoin investment is strong, it’s not without its complexities and risks. Companies venturing into this space must carefully consider several challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience dramatic swings in short periods. This volatility can impact a company’s balance sheet and quarterly earnings, making financial reporting more complex. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. Changes in laws or new regulations could significantly impact the value or usability of Bitcoin holdings. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to protect against hacks, theft, or loss of private keys. This necessitates specialized expertise and infrastructure. Accounting and Tax Implications: The accounting treatment for cryptocurrencies can be intricate and varies by jurisdiction. Companies need clear guidance on how to report holdings, gains, and losses for tax purposes. Public Scrutiny: Investing in a volatile and relatively new asset class can draw scrutiny from shareholders, analysts, and the public, especially if the investment underperforms. Convano’s move highlights that even businesses outside the tech sector are weighing these risks against potential rewards, suggesting a growing institutional comfort level with digital assets.

In a recent social media post , the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad warned that the global economy could be on the brink of a collapse comparable to the 1929 crash and the Great Depression. Kiyosaki’s warning cites ballooning U.S. debt as the chief reason for concern and recommends, in his characteristic fashion, a shift toward assets such as gold , silver , and Bitcoin ( BTC ). “I sit tight with gold, silver, & Bitcoin. Good luck. We may be on the brink of another 1929 crash and another Great Depression. America’s debt is out of control. America is the worlds biggest debtor nation in history. You can only print money to pay your bills….for so long.” DO YOU have a 401k or IRA filled with stocks?

In the hours leading up to the post, the Bitcoin price dipped below the critical $119,000 mark. While the asset has somewhat rebounded since, some of the ongoing market developments could undermine its status as a hedge in the future. Nonetheless, Kiyosaki appears steadfast in his advocacy for “digital gold”, implying once again that the coin is a viable counterweight to fiat instability. His reasoning appears to follow that of veteran financiers like Warren Buffett and Jim Rogers, who have reportedly also increased their exposure to cash and precious metals. On July 25, Kiyosaki also noted the limitations of exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ), which he called “paper assets,” given their intrinsic lack of security that comes with tangible holdings like precious metals. “ETFs make investing easier for the average investor… so I do recommend them.… Yet an ETF is like having a picture of a gun for personal defense.” The author’s most recent remarks thus reflect a long-standing skepticism toward traditional financial instruments. His strategy remains consistent: focus on accumulating tangible stores of value and non-fiat hedges.

This resilience followed a swift intra-week drop of nearly 5 percent, which triggered large-scale liquidations. Over $1.1 billion in long positions were wiped out across major exchanges across a range of assets, on July 23rd and 24th, revealing how overheated speculative positioning had become during BTC’s recent run to all-time highs. While the correction was shallow in price terms, its effect on leverage was deep, reinforcing the reflexive nature of crypto markets when froth builds too quickly. Under the surface, risk appetite continues to rotate aggressively into altcoins. Ethereum’s open interest dominance has risen from 17 to 26 percent, while Bitcoin’s has declined to just 41 percent, a sharp drop from 51 percent in April. Although total altcoin open interest dominance remains steady in the low 30s, its composition has been fluid, driven by fast-changing narratives and listing activity. The combined open interest across major altcoins such as ETH, SOL, XRP, and DOGE has surged from $26 billion to $44 billion in just four weeks, reflecting a clear return of speculative capital. The market is now at a critical juncture. Bitcoin’s structural strength remains intact, with support levels holding and ETF demand steady, but the growing concentration of leverage in altcoins leaves the broader crypto complex vulnerable to sharp deleveraging events. As speculative positioning builds, the risk of cascading liquidations increases, especially if macro headlines turn negative or if price momentum stalls. Recent data shows the US economy’s rebound is masking deeper weaknesses. Business investment is slowing , with durable goods orders falling 9.3 percent in June and core capital goods down 0.7 percent, as tariff uncertainty disrupts planning.

This resilience followed a swift intra-week drop of nearly 5 percent, which triggered large-scale liquidations. Over $1.1 billion in long positions were wiped out across major exchanges across a range of assets, on July 23rd and 24th, revealing how overheated speculative positioning had become during BTC’s recent run to all-time highs. While the correction was shallow in price terms, its effect on leverage was deep, reinforcing the reflexive nature of crypto markets when froth builds too quickly. Under the surface, risk appetite continues to rotate aggressively into altcoins. Ethereum’s open interest dominance has risen from 17 to 26 percent, while Bitcoin’s has declined to just 41 percent, a sharp drop from 51 percent in April. Although total altcoin open interest dominance remains steady in the low 30s, its composition has been fluid, driven by fast-changing narratives and listing activity. The combined open interest across major altcoins such as ETH, SOL, XRP, and DOGE has surged from $26 billion to $44 billion in just four weeks, reflecting a clear return of speculative capital. The market is now at a critical juncture. Bitcoin’s structural strength remains intact, with support levels holding and ETF demand steady, but the growing concentration of leverage in altcoins leaves the broader crypto complex vulnerable to sharp deleveraging events. As speculative positioning builds, the risk of cascading liquidations increases, especially if macro headlines turn negative or if price momentum stalls. Recent data shows the US economy’s rebound is masking deeper weaknesses. Business investment is slowing , with durable goods orders falling 9.3 percent in June and core capital goods down 0.7 percent, as tariff uncertainty disrupts planning. A front-loaded surge in equipment spending early this year has faded , and Q2 GDP growth—forecast at 2.4 percent—is largely driven by temporary inventory and trade adjustments rather than real demand.

2025-07-28 12:30:11+00:00,Bitcoin Purchases: Unveiling MicroStrategy’s Strategic Pause,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Purchases: Unveiling MicroStrategy’s Strategic Pause In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, every move by major players sends ripples across the market. So, when news broke that MicroStrategy, a company synonymous with significant Bitcoin purchases , did not acquire any Bitcoin (BTC) between July 21 and July 27, 2023, it naturally piqued the interest of investors and analysts alike. This brief pause, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, prompts a deeper dive into the company’s well-known strategy and what such a decision might signify for the broader digital asset landscape. Is this a deviation, a strategic recalibration, or simply business as usual for the corporate Bitcoin giant? Who is MicroStrategy, and Why Do Their Bitcoin Purchases Matter So Much? Before we dissect the recent news, it’s crucial to understand the entity at the heart of it: MicroStrategy. Founded in 1989 by Michael Saylor, the company started as a business intelligence firm. However, it gained immense prominence in the crypto space when it began aggressively accumulating Bitcoin in August 2020, becoming the first publicly traded company to adopt BTC as its primary treasury reserve asset. Under Saylor’s fervent advocacy, MicroStrategy transformed into a proxy for institutional Bitcoin adoption, with its stock price often mirroring BTC’s performance. Their Bitcoin purchases matter for several key reasons: Market Bellwether: MicroStrategy’s consistent buying has been seen as a vote of confidence in Bitcoin, influencing broader institutional sentiment. Significant Holdings: The company holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin, making it one of the largest corporate holders globally. Their actions, whether buying or pausing, can impact market dynamics. Pioneering Strategy: MicroStrategy’s unique strategy of leveraging debt to fund Bitcoin acquisitions has been closely watched, setting a precedent (or a cautionary tale) for other corporations considering similar moves. Michael Saylor’s Influence: Saylor himself is a prominent Bitcoin maximalist, and his public statements and the company’s actions often drive discussions and analyses within the crypto community. The Unveiling: MicroStrategy’s Brief Halt in Bitcoin Purchases The core of the recent news is straightforward: MicroStrategy did not add to its substantial Bitcoin holdings during the specified week. Walter Bloomberg’s concise update on X (formerly Twitter) highlighted this period of inaction from July 21 to July 27. For a company that has, at times, announced multiple Bitcoin purchases within short spans, even a week-long pause can raise eyebrows. It’s important to note that MicroStrategy has typically disclosed its Bitcoin acquisitions through official filings (like 8-Ks with the SEC) or direct announcements. The information from Walter Bloomberg, while reliable for market updates, primarily points to the absence of such an announcement during that specific timeframe. This isn’t an announcement of selling, nor is it necessarily a shift in long-term strategy, but rather a momentary lull in their otherwise relentless accumulation. Decoding the Pause: What Could Be Behind the Lack of Bitcoin Purchases? When a major player like MicroStrategy takes a temporary break from its characteristic Bitcoin purchases , speculation naturally arises. While the company itself has not provided specific reasons for this particular week’s inactivity, several plausible factors could contribute to such a decision: Potential Reason Explanation Market Conditions & Price Action Bitcoin’s price often moves in cycles, with periods of consolidation or uncertainty. The week in question might have seen price levels that MicroStrategy’s strategists deemed less optimal for significant entry, perhaps waiting for a dip or clearer upward momentum. Strategic Re-evaluation or Capital Allocation Companies regularly review their capital allocation strategies. This pause could indicate an internal assessment of available capital, debt servicing, or even exploring alternative funding mechanisms for future acquisitions. Operational Lull or Timing Executing large-scale corporate Bitcoin purchases involves significant operational and logistical planning. It’s possible that the necessary internal processes, legal reviews, or funding arrangements were not aligned for an acquisition during that specific week. Regulatory Clarity or Caution The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Companies, especially public ones, might exercise caution during periods of regulatory uncertainty or pending decisions that could impact their digital asset holdings. Patience and Long-Term Vision MicroStrategy’s strategy is fundamentally long-term. They aren’t day traders. A week without buying might simply reflect that there was no urgent need or compelling opportunity to add to their already substantial stack, consistent with a patient ‘hodl’ approach.

2025-07-28 12:33:51+00:00,Bitcoin’s MVRV Ratio Flashes Warning: Top of the Cycle Incoming?,"Analysts are sounding the alarm that Bitcoin’s current uptrend may be nearing a peak, not based on price action alone, but through a powerful on-chain metric: the Market Value to Realized Value, 365-day moving average (MVRV 365DMA). According to a July 28 analysis shared by CryptoQuant contributor Yonsei_dent, the 2025 cycle resembles 2021’s “double-top camel” structure, where two peaks formed roughly six months apart before ushering in a painful bear market. MVRV Flashing Caution The MVRV 365DMA is a historically reliable indicator of market cycle tops. It measures the average profit or loss of holders over a one-year period. In 2021, it formed a dual-peak structure before Bitcoin entered an extended downtrend. Per Yonsei’s analysis , this year’s pattern is now mirroring that setup, with the first peak already in and a second one potentially materializing around September 10 if history repeats. The market watcher warned traders that despite BTC pushing toward the $119,000 region, they should “tighten risk management and stay nimble,” as the MVRV is a lagging indicator, meaning Bitcoin’s actual price peak could arrive sooner, possibly in late August. “We’re entering a zone where optimism and caution must coexist,” he wrote. “Let on-chain timing guide your strategy.” His cautious outlook is in stark contrast with current market sentiment, which is largely bullish following a weekly candle close at $119,466. Fellow analyst Rekt Capital noted this break is a sign that there could be a potential breakout from a long-term bull flag pattern. However, cracks are forming beneath the surface. As CryptoVizArt recently reported, a bearish divergence between price and the RSI could be undermining bullish momentum, and a liquidation cluster around $114,000 and $113,600 remains a mid-term downside risk. Price Action Stays Strong As of Monday, BTC is trading at $118,800 per CoinMarketCap, up 0.5% in 24 hours and 3.4% below its all-time high of $123,091, set on July 14. While the asset has gained 10.6% in the past month and 75% over the last year, its weekly change is flat at just 0.1%, signaling a likely pause in momentum. The OG cryptocurrency ranged between $117,953 and $119,754 in the last 24 hours, and between $115,184 and $119,959 over the past week, showing it is still consolidating in a tight zone. With the MVRV ratio flashing red and macro catalysts like potential Fed rate cuts on the horizon, the next six weeks could define the fate of this market cycle if Yonsei_dent’s assessment is to be believed.
