2025-07-20 07:00:24+00:00,Ethereum Open Interest Hits Record $50 Billion – Volatility Incoming?,"Ethereum is holding firm above the $3,500 level, a key support reclaimed last Friday, signaling renewed strength in the market. After surging over 70% since late June, ETH appears to have entered a new bullish phase driven by rising demand and institutional interest. The momentum has shifted clearly in favor of the bulls, with technical structure and price action aligning to support further upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Sales Surge To Highest Level Since April – Details Adding to the bullish outlook, CryptoQuant data shows that Ethereum open interest has reached an all-time high, pointing to growing trader activity and rising capital in ETH derivatives markets. This surge in open interest often precedes large price movements, suggesting that Ethereum could see heightened volatility and expansion in the coming days. The combination of sustained price levels, strong trend continuation, and increasing participation sets the stage for a potentially explosive move. If bulls can maintain control above $3,500, Ethereum could be gearing up for a fresh leg higher in the short term. As the market awaits confirmation, all eyes are on ETH to see whether this momentum can drive it toward new 2025 highs. The coming week could prove pivotal for Ethereum’s medium-term trend. Ethereum Open Interest Hits Record ATH Ethereum’s market setup continues to strengthen, with open interest in ETH derivatives reaching a new all-time high of $50 billion, according to CryptoQuant data shared by analyst Ted Pillows. “Buckle up and enjoy the Ethereum ride,” Pillows stated, highlighting the elevated volatility ahead as a potential springboard for aggressive price action. This level of open interest is historically significant and often signals that large players are positioning for a major move. Such a dramatic increase in capital committed to ETH futures and options suggests rising investor confidence and heightened anticipation of directional momentum. While high open interest can lead to either a sharp rally or a correction, current on-chain and macro fundamentals indicate that the market may be leaning bullish. Ethereum’s network growth remains steady, with rising active addresses, validator participation, and increased activity on Layer 2s. More importantly, the recent passage of the GENIUS Act in the US provides legal clarity for stablecoins and lays the foundation for broader crypto regulation, benefiting Ethereum directly as the base layer for DeFi and real-world asset tokenization. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Signals Aggressive Ethereum Accumulation: Institutional Demand Accelerates ETH Breaks Out With Eyes On Key Resistance Ethereum (ETH) has confirmed a powerful breakout above the psychological $3,500 level, closing at $3,588.26 on the 3-day chart. The move follows a strong rally from late June lows, with the price now up over 70% in less than a month. Importantly, ETH has broken past all major moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200 SMAs, signaling a shift toward bullish momentum across longer timeframes. Volume has increased significantly during this breakout, reinforcing the strength of the move. The next major resistance lies at $3,742.95, a level that previously acted as a local top earlier in the year. A successful close above this mark could open the door for a retest of the $4,000–$4,200 range.

2025-07-20 07:55:09+00:00,Bitcoin minimum transaction fee drops by 90%,"The minimum fees required for a Bitcoin transaction have been slashed by 90%. This news comes amid the debates over what the asset is best suited for. Some believe it is better for everyday payments, while others are still adamant that it satisfies the conditions to be a store of value. Over the past few years, there have been several enthusiasts who have felt Bitcoin is no longer a regular digital asset, considering the fact that the asset’s value has been quite stable since it launched. To make it more appealing, users of the biggest crypto network can now pay as low as 0.1 satoshi per virtual byte (sat/vByte) to process their transactions. A satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, with 1 satoshi currently standing at about 0.00000001 BTC. Bitcoin minimum transaction fee drops by 90% According to previous records, miners usually need to pay 1 satoshi/vByte as minimum fees to process their transactions. But because the leading digital assets network has been lacking in activities for a while, miners have decided to cut the minimum rate down by 905 in order to add more blocks to the blockchain. This refers to the weight of a transaction and how fast it will be processed. When the blockchain is busy, it will typically cost more to have miners prioritize your transactions. This latest development shows that demand for block space has dropped drastically. In other words, people are no longer making as many transactions as they used to, pushing miners to consider accepting lower fees. The Bitcoin network is run mainly by miners, which today mostly comprises industrial operations of warehouses full of sophisticated computers that process transactions on the network. Miners earn rewards by processing blocks, which contain transaction data, and adding them to the blockchain. For every block that is processed, miners are open to rewards of up to 3.125 BTC, which is currently worth around $367,000 at the current price, along with transaction fees. But as fewer people carry out transactions like sending funds, Ordinals inscriptions (NFTs), or other actions, transaction fees have been forced to remain low, which means miners earn less for every successful block they win. Prominent BTC proponents bemoan drop in network activity According to a pseudonymous Bitcoin miner Econoalchemist, transactions at the 0.1 sat/vByte fee rate have always been acceptable by most miners in the protocol. However, he noted that some node operators may choose to ignore such low fees. With Mempool and others now pushing the low fees, it means that there is a growing consensus among them towards accepting these kinds of transactions. “Over time, policy rules will trend toward matching consensus rules, lifting most relay restrictions,” he said. Prominent personalities in the payments and crypto space have previously lamented the slow rate of transactions on the blockchain, with former Twitter boss and Square CEO Jack Dorsey being the latest. Dorsey, a big fan of Bitcoin, said that the cryptocurrency would only succeed if people use it for sending and receiving money as it was designed for. “I think if it doesn’t transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it just gets increasingly irrelevant,” Dorsey said during a podcast in April. While Bitcoin has not been used for sending and receiving money like most people believe, it is currently satisfying another use case: individuals and firms are using it as a store of value. This action has propelled the asset to new all-time highs. “I suppose time will tell, but Bitcoin seems to be moving into [a store of value asset] and not being used for any type of transactions,” Scott Norris, CEO of Bitcoin miner Optiminer, said. Even with this new development, the sender of a crypto transaction can still choose the fee. This means that if they are in a hurry to get a payment seen and processed on time by miners, they can just increase the fee, and it will be added to a block quicker. Meanwhile, some users on X have expressed delight at how cheap it was to use the blockchain. “I love seeing sub-1 sat/vbyte transactions in my Mempool,” adding that he wanted to “pay as little as possible,” a user wrote.

2025-07-20 08:04:17+00:00,"Billion-Dollar Bank Loses $107,635 in One Day As Thieves Allegedly Infect ATMs With Malware: Report","A Michigan-based bank has reportedly lost tens of thousands of dollars in just 24 hours to thieves running an advanced ATM scheme. Authorities are charging Florida residents Robert R. Rosales Rivero and Geniver Antonio Pinuela Testa with conspiracy to commit bank theft and bank theft in violation of federal law for allegedly draining $107,635 from multiple Isabella Bank ATMs, reports MLive. An affidavit by a Homeland Security special agent alleges that the duo executed an “ATM jackpotting” operation in a single day, infecting the hard drives of Isabella Bank ATMs with malware to trick the machines into releasing cash. The agent says the ploy involves one person using a key to open an ATM and applying glue on its sensors before leaving for a short period to wait for the adhesive to take effect. The person would return to either change the ATM’s hard drive or use a device to corrupt its system. The other half of the duo would subsequently arrive with a mobile phone and a keyboard to control the machine to dispense cash. The alleged thieves were careful not to leave any trace of tampering. Isabella Bank’s surveillance video footage shows that four ATM locations across Michigan were hit between 1 a.m. and 8:09 p.m. on September 22nd. Using facial recognition software, authorities identified Testa as a potential suspect. He had been cited earlier this year for speeding while driving a 2011 Toyota Yaris. The lead helped police locate the alleged thieves in Minnesota, where they pulled over a Yaris with Testa and Rivero as occupants. Inside the car, authorities found a superglue, ATM keys, a mobile phone, a laptop and an electronic device. The police also searched the duo’s hotel room, where they found about $8,000 in cash, latex gloves, a flash drive and a hard drive. Testa and Rivero were charged in Minnesota but managed to post bail. Rivero is now in custody following a court appearance, while Testa remains at large. Both are Venezuelan nationals who arrived in the US legally. Isabella Bank has 35 branches across Michigan and $2.1 billion in total assets.

2025-07-20 08:30:47+00:00,Altseason: 3 Signals Investors Should Watch For – Analyst,"Aside from a new all-time high in the Bitcoin market, the last trading week also heralded some altseason shouts as a slight price decline by the premier cryptocurrency coincided with significant price rallies by major altcoins. A popular market analyst with the X username PlanD has weighed in on these recent market developments, highlighting three factors that would confirm the presence of an altseason. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Price Failed To Break $123,000 In The Past Week — Analyst Explains A BTC.D Retest At 63% May Mark Crucial Altseason Moment – Analyst Over the last week, a bullish rise in the altcoin market cap to $1.45 trillion sparked widespread speculations about the current status of the altseason. Interestingly, in an X post on July 19, PlanD outlines three market events that will signal the altseason’s commencement, namely a potential pullback in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside a critical technical development in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D). Following Bitcoin’s ascent beyond $121,000 and Ethereum’s price rise above $3,400, PlanD says the first two signals to watch for are healthy corrections in these assets’ prices. Specifically, the analyst explains that pullbacks toward the $111,000 and $3,250 regions for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, present an ideal situation that would allow capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, effectively causing a decline in BTC.D. Far from indicating weakness, PlanD says this retracement could actually catalyze the rise broader crypto market. Notably, if Ethereum finds support at $3,250, the ETH/BTC pair could strengthen, creating a favorable setup for altcoin rallies. This is because a stronger ETH/BTC pair is often a precursor to altcoin outperformance, as it signals increased investor appetite beyond Bitcoin. The third and perhaps most pivotal signal is unfolding in Bitcoin dominance. After months of holding above a rising support trendline, Plan D notes BTC.D has broken below it, signaling a potential change in market structure. However, the next test lies at the 63.40% dominance level. Should BTC.D retest this zone and fail to reclaim it, the analyst believes a new downtrend in dominance may begin, i.e., presenting the largest hallmark of altseason. In case of this scenario, PlanD also tells investors to expect strong bullish momentum in tokens linked to sectors such as real-world Assets (RWA), artificial Intelligence (AI), and gaming beyond the large and medium-cap tokens on popular blockchains.

In a post on the social media platform X, Scott Bessent says that the greenback will embrace the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies following President Donald Trump’s signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The law sets strict regulatory standards for banks and qualified stablecoin issuers to ensure the secure and transparent issuance of payment stablecoins. “Blockchain technologies will power the next generation of payments, and the US dollar is coming on-chain. Thanks to President Trump’s visionary leadership, and Senator Hagerty’s important work in Congress, the GENIUS Act will help cement the US dollar as the global reserve currency for generations to come.” Bloomberg reports that during a White House ceremony on Friday, Trump said the bill’s passage marks a major leap forward for US financial technology. “The Genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins.

The Home Office has announced a tender for the storage and sale of confiscated cryptocurrencies; the contract is valued at $53.7 million. The proceeds from the sale are expected to be transferred to the Treasury. UK authorities plan to sell at least 61,000 BTC (about $7 billion at the time of the announcement). The assets were confiscated after the uncovering of a financial pyramid scheme linked to a Chinese citizen, according to The Telegraph . In early 2024, British police confiscated 61,000 BTC connected to a large-scale investment fraud in China. At the same time, the trial of 42-year-old Jian Wen began; he is accused of involvement in laundering funds worth £5 billion. The proceeds from the sale of the bitcoins are expected to go to the Ministry of Finance, which is facing a budget deficit. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, is closely involved in overseeing the process. Simultaneously, the government announced a tender for the storage and sale of confiscated crypto-assets. The contract is valued at £40 million (about $54 million). However, as The Telegraph notes, no suitable bids have been submitted.

2025-07-20 09:35:11+00:00,Bitcoin Forms Golden Cross Again — How High Can BTC Climb?,"Following an impressive rally to new all-time highs (ATHs), bitcoin has been consolidating below the $120,000 range. However, market analysts have identified a signal that suggests the asset could see more explosive gains in the coming months. This signal is the BTC golden cross. It always forms when its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses the 200-day equivalent. Golden crosses often precede massive price gains, although this does not happen all the time. Golden Cross Appears Again According to the crypto trader Merlijn, the bitcoin golden cross just appeared , increasing the chances of BTC going parabolic in the coming months. The trader mentioned that BTC ballooned 139% when the cross appeared in 2016 and 2,200% when it showed up in 2017. Bitcoin also surged another 1,190% after the golden cross was spotted in 2020. “Now it’s flashing again in 2025. Same setup. Same signal. Miss this and you’ll remember it forever. Bitcoin is about to leave orbit,” Merlijn stated. Notably, not all golden crosses come with massive rallies. In September 2021, the signal flashed again, but BTC climbed only 50%. Another SMA crossover in October 2023 triggered a 45% rise in bitcoin’s price. These brief surges are often associated with the 50-day SMA failing to remain above its 200-day equivalent for an extended period. Short-lived crosses lead to minimal price spikes, while the long ones can trigger parabolic movements for bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin Fundamentals Stay Positive It is also worth noting that golden crosses do not always precede BTC price spikes. There have been cases where price crashes have followed the cross, primarily due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. One incident occurred in February 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak, which affected the global financial market, led to a 62% decline in bitcoin’s price after the golden cross appeared. Such experiences highlight the need to factor in broader technical and macro factors when analyzing the golden cross. Currently, analysts believe bitcoin fundamentals will support a sustainable bullish trend. With diminishing supply and rising demand, the chances of the bears taking control over the next few weeks are low. However, market analyst Rekt Capital says BTC needs a daily close above $120,000 and a post-breakout retest to reach new highs.

This massive shift isn’t just another portfolio rebalance; it highlights how quickly fortunes can change when on-chain titans make their move. This is huge. 😱The largest Bitcoin whales in history are dumping their holdings quietly this week—right as the U.S. government moves to enforce audit requirements on stablecoins like Tether. That alone will burst the biggest bubble and fraud in financial history: Bitcoin. It’s… pic.twitter.com/J5cDS2gveW — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) July 18, 2025 As regulatory scrutiny tightens around the GENIUS Act’s audit mandates for US stablecoins, risk management becomes paramount. Against this backdrop, it’s time to rethink allocations and pinpoint the best crypto to buy now, blending opportunity with discipline. ""Take Profits"": Crypto Expert''s Warning as Whale Wallet Moves $9.6B in BTC A $9.6 billion Bitcoin transfer by an early whale and new stablecoin rules in the GENIUS Act have some market experts warning of a potential price correction. This whale activity, along with the passage of three major U.S. crypto regulation bills in the Senate, has analysts on edge. Financial expert Jacob King (CEO of WhaleWire) suggests the seller might fear the GENIUS Act''s stablecoin audit requirements, calling it a potential catalyst. His take? ""That alone will burst the biggest bubble and fraud in the financial history of Bitcoin. It’s entirely propped up by fake money printed out of thin air,"" he posted Friday. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Innerdevcrypto remains long-term bullish, predicting Bitcoin could soar 10x in 5 to 10 years, potentially rivaling gold''s market cap. But here’s the catch: he strongly warns against endlessly holding without taking profits. The bullshit begins again:¨nobody was bullish enough¨¨the only thing that matters now is alts¨¨crime-season¨¨if you hold bitcoin now you are an idiot¨Ignore it allThe louder the insanity becomes on this app, the more you should do your daily inner work session, keep your… — Innerdevcrypto (@Innerdevcrypto) July 18, 2025 ""Take some profits on the way up,"" he urged, advising investors to enjoy gains responsibly. Bull markets, he notes, still experience brutal swings, with Bitcoin capable of plunging 30% and altcoins 50% during normal volatility. In short, don’t just believe blindly; have an exit strategy. Use crypto wins for real-life priorities like health, family, or experiences, and avoid becoming ""bitter maxis"" who never spend. Remember, even hot assets like Solana, Sui, and NFTs (Pudgy Penguins included) remain a wild ride. On the flip side, technical signals look promising.

When an OG Bitcoin whale moved a staggering $9.6 billion worth of BTC and worries rippled through markets over looming stablecoin audit rules, seasoned investors sat up and took notice. This massive shift isn’t just another portfolio rebalance; it highlights how quickly fortunes can change when on-chain titans make their move. This is huge. 😱The largest Bitcoin whales in history are dumping their holdings quietly this week—right as the U.S. government moves to enforce audit requirements on stablecoins like Tether. That alone will burst the biggest bubble and fraud in financial history: Bitcoin. It’s… pic.twitter.com/J5cDS2gveW — Jacob King (@JacobKinge) July 18, 2025 As regulatory scrutiny tightens around the GENIUS Act’s audit mandates for US stablecoins, risk management becomes paramount. Against this backdrop, it’s time to rethink allocations and pinpoint the best crypto to buy now, blending opportunity with discipline. ""Take Profits"": Crypto Expert''s Warning as Whale Wallet Moves $9.6B in BTC A $9.6 billion Bitcoin transfer by an early whale and new stablecoin rules in the GENIUS Act have some market experts warning of a potential price correction. This whale activity, along with the passage of three major U.S. crypto regulation bills in the Senate, has analysts on edge. Financial expert Jacob King (CEO of WhaleWire) suggests the seller might fear the GENIUS Act''s stablecoin audit requirements, calling it a potential catalyst. His take? ""That alone will burst the biggest bubble and fraud in the financial history of Bitcoin. It’s entirely propped up by fake money printed out of thin air,"" he posted Friday. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Innerdevcrypto remains long-term bullish, predicting Bitcoin could soar 10x in 5 to 10 years, potentially rivaling gold''s market cap. But here’s the catch: he strongly warns against endlessly holding without taking profits. The bullshit begins again:¨nobody was bullish enough¨¨the only thing that matters now is alts¨¨crime-season¨¨if you hold bitcoin now you are an idiot¨Ignore it allThe louder the insanity becomes on this app, the more you should do your daily inner work session, keep your… — Innerdevcrypto (@Innerdevcrypto) July 18, 2025 ""Take some profits on the way up,"" he urged, advising investors to enjoy gains responsibly. Bull markets, he notes, still experience brutal swings, with Bitcoin capable of plunging 30% and altcoins 50% during normal volatility. In short, don’t just believe blindly; have an exit strategy. Use crypto wins for real-life priorities like health, family, or experiences, and avoid becoming ""bitter maxis"" who never spend. Remember, even hot assets like Solana, Sui, and NFTs (Pudgy Penguins included) remain a wild ride. On the flip side, technical signals look promising.

2025-07-20 09:50:36+00:00,UK Home Office Plans to Sell $7 Billion in Seized Bitcoin: The Telegraph,"The UK government is preparing to offload billions of pounds worth of seized Bitcoin, as pressure mounts on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to plug a widening budget gap. Key Takeaways: The UK government is planning to sell over £5 billion in seized Bitcoin to help ease fiscal pressures. A centralized framework is being developed to manage storage and sales, with the Treasury closely monitoring potential proceeds. Experts warn against a hasty sell-off, drawing parallels to the UK’s poorly timed gold sale in 1999. Working alongside police forces, the Home Office is designing a centralized framework to store and sell confiscated digital assets, according to a report from The Telegraph . The plan, dubbed the “crypto storage and realisation framework,” could enable the sale of more than £5 billion ($6.5 billion) in Bitcoin, most of it recovered from historic criminal investigations. A single 2018 raid alone netted 61,000 BTC, now valued at over £5.4 billion, after prices hit $123,000 last week. Treasury Monitors Crypto Seizures as Law Enforcement Leads Sales While law enforcement handles the seizures and sales, the Treasury is reportedly keeping a close eye on the operation. Any proceeds not returned to fraud victims are typically split between the central government and law enforcement programs. Experts believe the Treasury could receive billions from the sales, providing a rare financial boost as Reeves faces the dual challenge of rising debt costs and weak economic growth. “There is oil under our feet in terms of digital assets,” said Aidan Larkin, CEO of seizure specialist Asset Reality. “I do think digital assets will lead to a large windfall for government agencies and the public purse over the next five to ten years.” The Home Office had previously invited bids for the contract to manage the crypto sale system , with terms suggesting up to £40 million in commissions for the chosen provider. While initial bids failed to meet requirements, the project is expected to continue in a revised form. The 2018 seizure of Bitcoin tied to Chinese fraudster Jian Wen is now under review, with victims requesting restitution. If the Treasury were to keep half of that haul, approximately £2.6 billion, it would go a long way toward easing fiscal pressures. Former Chancellor Norman Lamont urged Reeves to “spend it right away,” but others warn against rushing. UK’s Bitcoin Sell-Off Sparks Fears of “Another Gold Blunder” Comparisons have already been drawn to Gordon Brown’s infamous 1999 gold sale, when the UK sold 401 tonnes of gold at rock-bottom prices, a decision that cost the country tens of billions.

2025-07-20 10:00:19+00:00,UK Government Looks To Offload $7 Billion Seized Bitcoin – Details,"The UK government is reportedly planning to sell billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in a bid to support public spending. This development comes following Bitcoin’s latest success in establishing a new all-time high at $123,091. UK Chancellor Turns To Crypto Proceeds To Plug Financial Holes – Report According to a report by local media Telegraph, the UK Home Office is presently exploring means to offload at least £5 billion ($6.71 billion) in seized BTC as the Labor-led government reportedly struggles with financing the public budget following recent policy reversals on welfare and winter fuel allowance by Prime Minister Kier Starmer. The Telegraph explains that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, is looking to seal a budget hole of £20 billion amid rising inflation figures, higher borrowing costs, and weak economic growth. While some ministers have proposed a rise in taxes to fill this gap, Reeves is currently exploring other means to alleviate the financial mayhem, including sales of confiscated crypto assets from illicit activities. The exact amount of digital assets seized by the UK government is unknown. However, a specific police operation in 2018 resulted in the impoundment of 61,000 BTC from a Chinese ponzi scheme. These assets, valued just above £300 million ($402.36 million) at the time of seizure, are now worth £5.4 billion ($7.24 million) at the present market rate, representing a resounding 1700% price gain. UK To Launch Crypto Storage System In handling the purported BTC offload, Telegraph further reports that the UK Home Office is looking to develop a crypto storage and realization system that will enable law enforcement agents to effectively preserve and sell seized digital assets. Official documents reveal this project is expected to cost £40 million ($53.65 million), with the service provider set to receive a further commission on each asset sale. Interestingly, it’s worth noting that the UK government has previously kicked against the idea of a National Bitcoin Reserve following suggestions by Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party. But these recent plans may suggest that government figures may now acknowledge crypto assets as a source of significant revenue. Meanwhile, confiscated crime proceeds are usually split between the UK Treasury and law enforcement agencies. Therefore, it remains unknown what the exact percentage of the reported £5.4 billion BTC sale will be credited to balance the UK government’s books.

In a notice, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) says 103,000 individuals across the United States with accounts on Medicare.gov are impacted by a data breach. CMS says it discovered that user data had been compromised after receiving multiple complaints through its call center. According to the federal agency, hackers may have used information from external sources to collect data such as names, dates of birth, Medicare Beneficiary Identifiers, coverage start dates and ZIP codes to fraudulently create Medicare.gov accounts. Once inside, the thieves gained access to more sensitive data, including provider details, mailing addresses, dates of service, diagnosis codes, services received and plan premiums. “On May 2, 2025, representatives at our 1-800-MEDICARE call center flagged complaints from people with Medicare who had received a letter through the mail about the creation of a Medicare.gov account. However, these callers hadn’t created the accounts or asked anyone else to do it for them. Noticing the similarities in the reports, we investigated further and discovered more cases of accounts created between 2023 and 2025 that matched this pattern. We quickly deactivated those accounts, while also launching a larger effort to find the bad actors who created them.” The CMS is a federal agency under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tasked with overseeing the country’s healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Health Insurance Marketplace. The CMS is encouraging affected individuals to get a free credit report from each of the three major nationwide credit reporting companies.

Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s ETHE recorded modest outflows. Ether ETF trading volumes hit $2.8 billion, while total assets under management for Ether products surged to a record $18.37 billion. Inside Coinbase’s $300M ETH heist The Coinbase hack itself remains one of the most controversial incidents in 2025. As first reported by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, the attacker initially swapped $42.5 million worth of stolen Bitcoin for Ethereum via Thorchain. They later converted nearly 18,000 ETH into over $45 million in DAI stablecoins, further obfuscating the trail. The breach reportedly stemmed from a social engineering scheme. Hackers bribed external contractors and support employees located outside the United States to gain access to sensitive user data, impacting 97,000 Coinbase accounts. Login credentials weren’t compromised, but names, addresses, and emails were exposed. Coinbase has pledged to reimburse affected users and estimate damages.

Its 24-hour trading volume hovers around $30 billion. Source: SoSoBValue The institutional appetite for Ethereum is still accelerating. Ether-linked US ETFs recorded $402.5 million inflow on Friday and outpaced Bitcoin ’s $363.45 million. BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone accounted for $394.91 million of that total. Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s ETHE recorded modest outflows. Ether ETF trading volumes hit $2.8 billion, while total assets under management for Ether products surged to a record $18.37 billion. Inside Coinbase’s $300M ETH heist The Coinbase hack itself remains one of the most controversial incidents in 2025. As first reported by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, the attacker initially swapped $42.5 million worth of stolen Bitcoin for Ethereum via Thorchain. They later converted nearly 18,000 ETH into over $45 million in DAI stablecoins, further obfuscating the trail. The breach reportedly stemmed from a social engineering scheme. Hackers bribed external contractors and support employees located outside the United States to gain access to sensitive user data, impacting 97,000 Coinbase accounts. Login credentials weren’t compromised, but names, addresses, and emails were exposed. Coinbase has pledged to reimburse affected users and estimate damages. However, the company reportedly refused to meet the attacker’s $20 million ransom demand. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025. Learn More"

Meanwhile, Hedera’s HBAR rally points to explosive altcoin season, with several tokens flirting with 50x upside. Here’s why a short-term pullback may clear the path for new highs, and which DeFi utility project deserves a spot on every best crypto presale 2025 list. BTC Bears Filling Gaps Before Bull Resumes A classic V‑shaped reversal after Bitcoin’s all‑time high near $123,000 signals profit‑taking and bearish control. Two Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) on the 4‑hour chart, first at $119,000 and the next around $111,000, are magnets for price reversion. A CME gap near $114,000–$116,000 adds credence to an imminent retracement toward that zone before bulls reclaim their footing. Yet on-chain metrics remain supportive: daily volumes have averaged over $100 billion, and the Fear & Greed Index sits firmly in “Greed,” not yet extreme. Should BTC fill these gaps, the next bitcoin price prediction targets of $170,000 and even $200,000 become plausible as leverage unwinds and fresh buyers step in.

Weekly RSI above 50 and a positive MACD echo October 2023 readings that preceded a multi‑month boom, underpinning a bullish Hedera outlook for 2025. Shorter‑term, however, the six‑hour chart shows HBAR hitting a Fibonacci extension at 1.61× wave one, accompanied by bearish divergences in RSI and MACD. A pullback to $0.240 would offer a healthier base for the next leg higher, potentially positioning HBAR for 50× gains against select low cap crypto gems once macro tailwinds return.

Analysis Company Releases Technical Analysis,"In its latest technical assessment of Solana (SOL), cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision stated that the correction structure predicted in their previous analysis has come true and the price has declined further with the bearish (c) wave. The company said that Solana currently appears to be in a recovery phase, but critical resistance levels need to be overcome for this move to turn into a sustained rally. According to the analysis, the overall downward pattern in Solana remains corrective, defined by the blue (A)-(B)-(C) formation. This structure may be completed in the short term. However, whether the recovery will transform into an impulsive, strong, and sustainable upward wave will become clear in the coming days. If the recovery is merely a new corrective wave, the current uptrend may be limited. Technical analysis chart shared by MakroVision.

MakroVision notes that the $223 level, in particular, represents a strong resistance area with high liquidity. A break above this level could be the first sign of a sustained upward trend. After $223, the next significant hurdle is $246. A break above this level could trigger a move towards the $270 region for Solana. Meanwhile, support levels to watch in the event of a potential pullback are also being carefully considered. $198 (0.5 Fibonacci) and $193 (0.618 Fibonacci) are seen as short-term support zones, while $188 is considered a strong support level.

2025-07-20 10:52:49+00:00,Ethereum Price Prediction: ETH Just Hit 180-Day Peak – Can This Last?,"Ethereum has surged to a dramatic 180-day peak of $3,671, delivering an explosive 152% rally from March lows near $1,392. The latest surge gained momentum through July with ETH posting a record 37% monthly gain , driven by historic institutional demand through spot ETFs that recorded single-day inflows of $720 million. ETH is currently trading well above all major moving averages, and it is approaching the critical $4,000-$4,200 resistance zone. Institutional accumulation behind Ethereum’s rally has outpaced Bitcoin’s ETF flows, with BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale funneling billions into Ethereum products. This shifting institutional preference provides fundamental support for technical breakouts, positioning ETH for potential acceleration. Technical analysis reveals that Ethereum is approaching a historic inflection point, where cycle patterns suggest that the most explosive phase may still lie ahead. Ascending Channel Targets $4,100 Breakout Ethereum’s 4-hour chart reveals methodical progression through a well-defined ascending channel, building momentum since March lows. ETH is currently testing the upper boundary around $3,700-$3,800, and trades well above all exponential moving averages in bullish alignment. Source: TradingView The positioning indicates strong underlying momentum with pullbacks likely finding support at progressively higher levels. RSI readings of 78.54 indicate strong momentum approaching overbought conditions, but institutional ETF flows provide fundamental support for sustained advances. The projection above $4,100 is based on measured moves from a channel breakout, combined with resistance levels aligning with previous cycle highs. ETF inflows exceeding those of Bitcoin indicate a shifting institutional preference toward Ethereum, with multiple public companies expanding their treasuries to cover ETH as well. Cycle Analysis Suggests Explosive Phase Ahead Ethereum approaches major resistance around $4,000-$4,200, which must be cleared to confirm the initiation of a new bull market cycle. A breakout above this “Strong High” resistance zone would likely trigger what analysts describe as “the most explosive part of the cycle.” Source: Crypto Caesar Market structure analysis reveals that ETH has successfully reclaimed multiple intermediate levels as it approaches the final major hurdle. Cycle comparison analysis provides an even more compelling long-term outlook.

Current positioning suggests that the transition point may be approaching even further, with Bitcoin showing signs of deceleration. At the same time, Ethereum builds momentum for its expansion phase, targeting cycle parity and potentially parabolic advances. BTC Hyper: Final Chance to Join $3M Presale Success As Ethereum moves towards $4,000+ levels, Bitcoin is not left behind.

2025-07-20 11:03:56+00:00,Law enforcement investigate crypto-linked disappearance of California octogenarian,"Sheriffs in California have launched investigations into the disappearance of a 74-year-old man. According to reports, the man, Naipang Hou, disappeared in May after leaving his California home without his phone, and authorities believe the disappearance is linked to his family’s crypto fortune. According to local law enforcement, they believe that the disappearance is a result of the affluence of his family through digital assets . Hou was said to have left home on a Monday without his mobile phone, and days later, his silver Toyota Yaris was found abandoned near a hiking trail in Rancho Cucamonga. Authorities proceeded to declare him missing on May 4, with sheriff’s deputies now suspecting that he may have been kidnapped. California sheriffs kickstart investigations into Hou’s disappearance According to a statement by the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department on July 7, its Specialized Investigations Division had started looking into Hou’s disappearance, branding it suspicious and finding evidence of extensive fraudulent activities related to his bank accounts. The Sheriff’s Department mentioned that an unnamed suspect contacted Hou’s family with his phone to impersonate him. While law enforcement in California has yet to arrest any suspect in the case, investigators have not ruled out foul play. In response to his disappearance, Hou’s son, Wen Hou, offered a $250,000 reward for anyone with information leading to the safe return of his father. He believes that someone stole his father’s identity and drained more than $1 million from his accounts. Wen, who made his fortune in crypto, has been serving as the CIO of investment firm and hedge fund Coincident Capital since 2019. Discussing his father’s disappearance, Wen said he had no reason to disappear. “I miss him a lot,” he told local media. “He’s sort of a guide to my life,” he said in an interview with ABC. He mentioned that his father had been remodelling their home earlier this year after he discovered a massive leak. “He did not mention anything suspicious; we knew he’d been getting bids from multiple contractors,” said Wen. “He was living actually at an apartment that insurance provided, so he wasn’t always directly involved with the day-to-day repair.” Wen noted that the last time he saw his father physically was when they went on a fishing trip. We had a great time,” Wen said. “He was mentally well, and he was happy, and there was nothing off about his personality or anything like that.” Authorities have mentioned that he was likely abducted days after the fishing trip. Wen said he started growing suspicious after he texted his father to visit, and I felt like he was not the one replying. According to commentators, wealthy crypto users often make themselves targets of criminals by flaunting their wealth online, neglecting online privacy or security. They added that poor security habits, along with the misconception that crypto is fully anonymous despite traceable blockchains, also increase vulnerability. Another comment mentioned that users are unknowingly exposed as targets through data leaks, wallet activities, and their social media posts. The trend, known as “wrench attacks” in the crypto industry, has seen an increase in kidnapping , threatening, and holding people hostage to steal their money or seed phrases. Founder of blockchain forensic firm CryptoCare, Nick Harris, mentioned that there have been 22 reported cases globally in the first half of the year. Harris mentioned that police and other authorities are now deploying cybercrime units and blockchain forensic teams to trace transactions for ongoing investigations.

Discussing his father’s disappearance, Wen said he had no reason to disappear. “I miss him a lot,” he told local media. “He’s sort of a guide to my life,” he said in an interview with ABC. He mentioned that his father had been remodelling their home earlier this year after he discovered a massive leak. “He did not mention anything suspicious; we knew he’d been getting bids from multiple contractors,” said Wen. “He was living actually at an apartment that insurance provided, so he wasn’t always directly involved with the day-to-day repair.” Wen noted that the last time he saw his father physically was when they went on a fishing trip. We had a great time,” Wen said. “He was mentally well, and he was happy, and there was nothing off about his personality or anything like that.” Authorities have mentioned that he was likely abducted days after the fishing trip. Wen said he started growing suspicious after he texted his father to visit, and I felt like he was not the one replying. According to commentators, wealthy crypto users often make themselves targets of criminals by flaunting their wealth online, neglecting online privacy or security. They added that poor security habits, along with the misconception that crypto is fully anonymous despite traceable blockchains, also increase vulnerability. Another comment mentioned that users are unknowingly exposed as targets through data leaks, wallet activities, and their social media posts. The trend, known as “wrench attacks” in the crypto industry, has seen an increase in kidnapping , threatening, and holding people hostage to steal their money or seed phrases. Founder of blockchain forensic firm CryptoCare, Nick Harris, mentioned that there have been 22 reported cases globally in the first half of the year. Harris mentioned that police and other authorities are now deploying cybercrime units and blockchain forensic teams to trace transactions for ongoing investigations.

2025-07-20 11:30:57+00:00,Republican Lawmaker Warns GENIUS Act Opens Door To Layered CBDCs,"On Friday, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, marking a pivotal moment for stablecoin regulation in the United States. After months of debate and two previous rejections, the bill finally passed through Congress, setting a clearer legal framework for payment stablecoins and their role in the broader digital economy. The legislation aims to boost innovation while reinforcing the US dollar’s position in the digital financial system. However, the bill did not pass without resistance. Among the most vocal opponents was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who represents Georgia’s 14th District and serves as Chairwoman of the DOGE Committee. Greene reaffirmed her vote against the GENIUS Act, citing concerns that it lays the groundwork for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) without explicitly banning it. Her position echoes a wider debate in Washington over the future of digital currencies, surveillance risks, and financial freedom. Despite the pushback, the GENIUS Act’s passage reflects a growing bipartisan consensus that regulatory clarity is needed to foster crypto innovation in the US. While not all voices are aligned on its implications, the bill is now law, and its real-world impact on stablecoins and DeFi could be felt in the months ahead. Marjorie Taylor Greene Slams GENIUS Act Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Chairwoman of the DOGE Committee, delivered a strong rebuke of the GENIUS Act following its passage and President Trump’s signature on Friday. Greene, who voted against the bill, warned that the American public “hardly has any idea what it is, what it means, and what passed.” In her statement, she called the bill a Trojan horse for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) development, stating, “This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency.” Greene has long opposed any legislation that might open the door to CBDCs, arguing that a cashless society controlled by government-issued digital currency could be weaponized against US citizens. “Do you actually trust your government to never do that to you?” she challenged. “I don’t.” While Greene opposed the GENIUS Act, she voted yes on the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, a bill that would ban the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. Despite House approval, Greene warned that the Senate lacks the votes to move the bill forward. She also supported the Clarity Act, which passed the House and includes provisions for self-custody and clear regulatory guidelines for digital assets. However, she promised to vote no if self-custody protections are removed in Senate revisions. “The most important thing that needs to remain is protecting people’s self-custody of their digital currency.” Referencing the US exit from the gold standard in 1971, Greene argued the country is again at a crossroads—this time moving from tangible cash to a fully digitized currency system. “Your ability to buy and sell will ultimately be held in digital accounts controlled by the banks and the government,” she warned. Crypto Market Cap Analysis The total crypto market capitalization has broken decisively above the $3.6 trillion level, reaching a new yearly high at $3.81 trillion, as shown in the chart. This breakout comes after several weeks of consolidation and signals renewed bullish strength across the digital asset space. The move was supported by strong green candles and increasing volume, suggesting broad participation across majors and altcoins. Importantly, the breakout confirms a bullish structure, with higher highs and higher lows forming since the June bottom. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) sits around $3.04T, and the 100-day SMA nears $3.01T — both significantly below current price levels, reinforcing the strength of the uptrend. The 200-day SMA at $2.55T also confirms the long-term bullish posture. This breakout coincides with a backdrop of legal clarity in the US, particularly after the signing of the GENIUS Act, which boosts confidence in stablecoins and tokenized finance. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to lead the charge, but altcoins are now gaining momentum as capital rotates across the ecosystem.

In a post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous analyst TechDev shares with his 535,000 followers a TOTAL3 chart, which measures the entire market cap of crypto assets excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. Using three-month candles, TechDev’s analysis suggests that TOTAL3 is currently breaking out of a massive ascending triangle that started forming in late 2020. “Macro altcoin expansion has triggered. Not seen since late 2020. But this one comes after a 4-year coil…the longest in history.” Source: TechDev/X The analyst believes that the altcoin market is trading in line with what’s known as a Livermore Accumulation Cylinder, a pattern identified by trader Jesse Livermore, a pioneer of day trading prominent in the early 1900s. Livermore Cylinders typically see price trade within an ascending megaphone pattern, making increasingly higher highs and higher lows before a final parabolic run well outside the upper resistance line of the range. Says TechDev, “It’s not complicated. The entire alt market is in a Livermore cylinder.” Source: TechDev/X TechDev is also keeping an eye on stablecoins. He shares a chart showing the inverse of stablecoin dominance, or as he describes it, “stablecoin deployment.” The analyst notes that as stablecoins get deployed, it boosts digital asset prices, but that stablecoin deployment has never truly entered an uptrend, only temporary consolidations. “Most still don’t get it. This is stablecoin deployment. When it rises, crypto rises. But the moves associated with prior bull runs have only been countertrend moves. This will be the first actual breakout.

2025-07-20 12:27:09+00:00,"Bitcoin flashes ‘highest bearish’ signal in years; $100,000 crash next?","The Bitcoin Dominance Index has recorded its most bearish volume session since February 2021, signaling the strongest negative momentum in more than four and a half years. According to analysis by Master Ananda , this breakdown could mark a key turning point in the cryptocurrency cycle, possibly foreshadowing a crash from the six-figure price levels, he said in a TradingView post on July 20. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Notably, the bearish signal has emerged as Bitcoin ( BTC ) attempts to reclaim the $120,000 level after recently hitting a record high above $123,000. Ananda’s analysis indicates that Bitcoin dominance is breaking down from a steep ascending wedge on the weekly chart, a bearish pattern. The move is backed by a large volume candle, echoing the heavy selling pressure seen during the 2021 and 2022 peaks. At the same time, altcoins are gaining momentum, with Ethereum ( ETH ) and Litecoin ( LIT ) leading the charge, while Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ), and XRP are poised to follow. As Bitcoin consolidates near its resistance level, altcoins are steadily rising, signaling a maturing bull market. Master Ananda also pointed out that technical indicators suggest Bitcoin dominance could fall to around 49.16%, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, a historically strong area of support. A drop to this level would indicate a significant capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. Bitcoin next price level to watch This trend, Ananda said, sets the stage for a major market shift. Once Bitcoin completes its consolidation, it is expected to resume its upward trajectory, with targets projected between $134,000 and $136,000. However, a sudden correction, or even a sharp drop toward $100,000, remains a possibility if Bitcoin dominance continues to erode faster than expected. While Bitcoin’s volume appears to be weakening, social media activity around the asset has surged. Notably, since its climb to a new all-time high, Bitcoin has seen a dramatic spike in social media chatter, fueling concerns of a near-term pullback. According to sentiment platform Santiment , nearly 43% of all crypto-related mentions this week were focused on Bitcoin, marking its highest “social dominance” in years. Analyst Brian Quinlivan noted that this spike suggests rising retail investor FOMO, often a signal of overheated market conditions. Bitcoin social sentiment data.

2025-07-20 13:00:08+00:00,"Bitcoin Re-Enters Profit Zone As Greed Rises, But Rally To $200,000 Still Possible","Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $122,838 on July 14, but has since slipped into a phase of consolidation around the $118,000 level. The recent pause in upward momentum hasn’t dampened market sentiment, which remains firmly bullish. According to Coinmarketcap’s Fear & Greed Index, Bitcoin is still currently sitting at a greed level of 68. This sentiment, combined with technical analysis of the Logarithmic Growth Curve (LGC), shows that Bitcoin is still on track for powerful upward moves. Related Reading: $57 Billion Mistake? Ex‑Ripple Engineer Reveals XRP Investment Blunder Greed Returns To The Market, But Not Yet Overheated Bitcoin’s price action has spent the majority of the past 48 hours holding above $118,000 after a wave of profit-taking took place just after it peaked at $122,838. However, on-chain data shows an interesting overview of Bitcoin investors. Particularly, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. shared data from CryptoQuant showing that the 30-day moving average of the Fear and Greed Index has climbed back into the optimism zone, now sitting at 66.2%. Although sentiment surrounding the leading cryptocurrency is currently in greedy territory, this level is well below the 75% to 80% range, which coincided with new price highs in March 2024 and December 2025 The current 66% reading, while in the green level, suggests there’s still room for bullish sentiment to grow before the market enters a euphoric blow-off phase. In essence, this metric shows that if Bitcoin continues to consolidate and push higher without the sentiment entering into extreme greed levels between 75% and 80%, it will continue on a sustainable push to new heights. Image From X: @AxelAdlerJr Bitcoin Re-Enters Resistance Zone On Growth Curve As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin’s break above the $120,000 price level and its subsequent peak were followed by a wave of profit-taking. The trend saw Bitcoin’s price correct to $116,000 very briefly before stabilizing around $118,000. Interestingly, technical analysis of the weekly candlestick timeframe shows that Bitcoin re-entered the first band of the Logarithmic Growth Curve (LGC) resistance zone as it reached this price peak. This band, which is identified as the light pink region in the chart below, has always served as the profit-taking area in each of Bitcoin’s past bull markets. Interestingly, Bitcoin briefly tapped this area in December 2024 and January 2025 before being rejected, in a pattern similar to that of January 2021’s first top in the previous bull cycle. Image From TradingView: TradingShot Basically, this indicator implies that Bitcoin is now at the start of a final build-up phase. According to crypto analyst TradingShot, who posted the analysis on the TradingView platform, the ultimate top for this cycle is going to be between October and November 2025. Depending on the timing and strength of factors like anticipated US rate cuts in September, Bitcoin’s peak could land anywhere between $140,000 and $200,000. Related Reading: Whales?

2025-07-20 13:00:43+00:00,Crypto Exchange CoinDCX Falls Victim To $44 Million Hack – Details,"Indian exchange CoinDCX has suffered a cybersecurity attack, resulting in the loss of $44 million. This incident comes exactly one year after Indian exchange WazirX suffered a $235 million hack. CoinDCX Server Breach: User Funds Secure In an X post on July 19, CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta said that the crypto exchange suffered a server breach to one of its internal operational accounts. Gupta said that the affected wallet address is only used for liquidity supply on a partner exchange. Therefore, all assets in user wallets are safe and accounted for, with INR withdrawals fully functional. Furthermore, the CoinDEX CEO states the hack has been contained by isolating the affected operational account. Meanwhile, the value of the total lost assets would be offset by the exchange’s reserve as they commence efforts to track down the parties behind this hack. Gupta explains that these efforts involve various legs, ranging from an ongoing internal security review to the planned launch of a bug bounty program. The CoinDCX CEO said: Our internal security and operations teams have been working through the day along with leading cybersecurity partners to investigate the matter, patch any vulnerabilities and trace the movement of funds. We are collaborating with the exchange partner to block and recover assets, including coming out with a bug bounty program soon. Meanwhile, on-chain investigator ZachXBT has criticized CoinDCX for revealing the hack incident 17 hours after its occurrence, despite claiming to operate in transparency. Meanwhile, the renowned investigator also shared some updates on the hackers’ action in a telegram message: The attacker address was funded with 1 ETH from Tornado Cash and later bridged a portion of the stolen funds from Solana to Ethereum. Sumit Gupta has described the security breach as a learning moment, as the crypto industry continues to take major steps in battling cybersecurity threats. Crypto Service Losses Reach $2.17 Billion Notably, the attack on CoinDCX marks the latest major hack in the crypto industry, underscoring the ongoing need for robust and evolving security measures. Meanwhile, data by Chainanalysis shows bad actors made away with a total stolen funds of $2.17 billion from crypto services in 2025 H1 alone. This revelation is highly discouraging as the reported loot is already greater than the total value lost in 2024, which was nearly $2 billion. Chainanalysis warns that if the current rate of successful malicious events continues to occur, the cryptocurrency business may end up losing a projected $4.3 billion to hacks.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-coindcx-falls-to-44-million-hack/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK,Crypto News|CoinDCX|Ethereum|Sumit Gupta|Tornado Cash|Wazir|ZachXBT,BTC,"Crypto Exchange CoinDCX Falls Victim To $44 Million Hack – Details.

2025-07-20 13:54:10+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: Price Action Muted As BTC Consolidates Above $118,000","Bitcoin (BTC) has had a quiet weekend, with the price tethered around $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp drop on Friday, falling to $117,877, and registered another marginal decline on Saturday. The price has stayed above $118,000, indicating strong support at this level. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $118,035. Macro Drivers Could Dampen Bitcoin Halving Cycle Tim Draper, investor and founding partner of Draper Associates, believes macroeconomic drivers such as the decline of the US Dollar could dampen the impact of Bitcoin halving cycles. Halving cycles have been a major source of the flagship cryptocurrency’s volatility and bull cycles. Draper stated, “Between 10-20 years from now, the dollar will be extinct. The world is changing, and we are watching it happen. We are right in the center of an anthropological leap forward.” Draper believes investors are increasingly treating Bitcoin as an escape valve against fiat currency inflation, geopolitical tensions, poor governance, and a lack of trust in banking institutions. According to Draper, these factors are driving the global adoption of the asset. “The halvings may have less of an effect if Bitcoin runs against the dollar the way it has, because it will probably go for a prolonged period. It will still be affected in some way by that four-year cycle, but I think the effect will dampen. I think there will be a macro driver that pushes Bitcoin along, and I think the macro driver will be a bigger deal than the halvings.” Robert Kiyosaki Discusses Next Bitcoin Purchase Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki has revealed the price point at which he plans to purchase more Bitcoin and the level at which he plans to stop. Kiyosaki’s “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has become a top financial guide, having been translated into dozens of languages and helping millions. Kiyosaki stated, “Bitcoin is over $117K a coin. Going to buy one more bitcoin asap. It’s never been easier to become rich… even a millionaire. Please study, learn, and find out if Bitcoin is your path to becoming a millionaire.” BTC surged past $120,000 at the beginning of the week, on its way to a new all-time high of $123,091. However, Kiyosaki stated that he would pause further purchases. He explained the decision behind it, stating, “Bitcoin over $120K … I am buying one more coin… I will not buy any more… until I know where the economy is going. As tempting as bitcoin going to $200K to $1 million is… I do not want to be a hog and get slaughtered.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a consolidation phase after surging to a new all-time high on Monday. The flagship cryptocurrency crossed $120,000 on Monday, reaching $123,091 before declining. Despite the pause in upward momentum, analysts point out that bulls remain in control, with several positive factors acting as bullish catalysts. Global crypto adoption is increasing, while the passage of key crypto bills, including the GENIUS ACT and the CLARITY Act, offers regulatory clarity to the crypto space. Crypto analyst Darkfrost stated that on-chain analysts reveal that Bitcoin’s bullish trend remains intact. According to the analyst, the current market environment offers a constructive setup, thanks to institutional interest and regulatory clarity. Bitcoin’s growth rate indicator, measured by comparing its Market Cap to its Realized Cap, continues to indicate a bullish setup. The analyst noted that Bitcoin and the crypto market are transitioning from uncertainty to clarity, thanks to a pro-crypto administration.

2025-07-20 13:56:43+00:00,XRP price prediction after monster $40 billion inflow in a week,"XRP is experiencing unprecedented buying pressure, with the token now targeting a new all-time high of $4 amid a resurgent cryptocurrency bull market. In the past week, XRP’s market capitalization has surged by $40.54 billion, rising from $165.82 billion to $206.36 billion. This massive inflow drove the token’s price to $3.49, representing a 24.65% increase on the weekly timeframe. XRP one-week market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP price prediction With XRP seemingly gearing up for a breakout, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT for insight into where the asset could be headed by year-end. According to the model, if current buying momentum holds, XRP could trade between $5 and $7 by December. ChatGPT noted that the surge will likely be fueled by sustained investor demand, which is reinforcing market momentum. At the same time, the anticipated decline in Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance is likely to redirect capital into altcoins, signaling the start of an altseason, during which XRP, as a top-tier token, is poised to gain significantly. Adding to market optimism is growing regulatory clarity, especially in the U.S. After years of legal uncertainty, more explicit rules are helping to reduce risk for both institutional and retail investors. Notably, this comes as the U.S enacted the Genesis Act, which provides a legal framework for stablecoin, amid the final push towards ending the legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Why XRP is breaking out It’s worth noting that, beyond tracking the broader crypto market , XRP’s rally is being driven by several key developments. Notably, momentum picked up following the approval of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF on July 19, sparking renewed interest from institutions.

XRP is experiencing unprecedented buying pressure, with the token now targeting a new all-time high of $4 amid a resurgent cryptocurrency bull market. In the past week, XRP’s market capitalization has surged by $40.54 billion, rising from $165.82 billion to $206.36 billion. This massive inflow drove the token’s price to $3.49, representing a 24.65% increase on the weekly timeframe. XRP one-week market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP price prediction With XRP seemingly gearing up for a breakout, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT for insight into where the asset could be headed by year-end. According to the model, if current buying momentum holds, XRP could trade between $5 and $7 by December. ChatGPT noted that the surge will likely be fueled by sustained investor demand, which is reinforcing market momentum. At the same time, the anticipated decline in Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance is likely to redirect capital into altcoins, signaling the start of an altseason, during which XRP, as a top-tier token, is poised to gain significantly. Adding to market optimism is growing regulatory clarity, especially in the U.S. After years of legal uncertainty, more explicit rules are helping to reduce risk for both institutional and retail investors. Notably, this comes as the U.S enacted the Genesis Act, which provides a legal framework for stablecoin, amid the final push towards ending the legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Why XRP is breaking out It’s worth noting that, beyond tracking the broader crypto market , XRP’s rally is being driven by several key developments. Notably, momentum picked up following the approval of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF on July 19, sparking renewed interest from institutions.

Source: Finviz Limited Crypto Catalysts Years ago, Block would trade wildly based on revenues from bitcoin trading. Just in Q1''25, the fintech generated $2.30 billion in bitcoin trading revenues, but the company incurred a nearly equal $2.24 billion in transaction costs. Source: Block Q1''25 shareholder letter Block has offered bitcoin trading since 2018 , but the company has never moved beyond simple trading of the major crypto coin. Coinbase ( COIN ) has now developed a complete platform with trading in multiple coins and offering stablecoins to reach a market cap of over $100 billion, more than double Block. President Trump just approved the Genius Act to regulate stablecoins. The market is dominated by Coinbase and a few other players, while Block is nowhere to be found. The irony is that co-founder Jack Dorsey was one of the original proponents of bitcoin. Block owns over $1 billion worth of bitcoin based on owning 8,584 coins at the current price of $118K with a cost basis of only $261 million. Unfortunately, Block has remained stuck in focusing on the once innovative Cash App and moving into BNPL services. Neither, really offering the growth dynamics anymore offered by crypto. The company is starting to rollout bitcoin payments on Square in the 2H, with most sellers eligible in 2026. In addition, the company is developing bitcoin mining chips and systems under Proto with a business launch in the 2H, but the fintech isn''t moving far beyond the natural crypto trading opportunity. For Q1, Block gross profits only grew 9% to $2.29 billion. Again, the fintech has substantial transaction costs so that gross profits work out to more of a net revenue figure. Either way, the stock can''t really be valued based on total revenues due to the excessive bitcoin revenues without any profit benefit from the pass-through costs. The problem facing Block is that both Square and Cash App were innovative fintech products in the beginning, but the company no longer sees innovation outside of product tweaks. The Q1''25 shareholder letter focused on product innovation with up to 100 product enhancements to Square, but the new features to the technology platform aren''t moving the growth needle. The biggest product appears to be Cash App Afterpay, a product designed for small amounts of borrowing within Cash App. S&P 500 Surprise After the close on Friday, Block was announced as the new entry into the S&P 500 before the opening of trading on July 23.

It’s not just about selling coins, it’s building a real ecosystem with tools and partners, not just a concept. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Gains Early Buzz Bitcoin Hyper taps into the Layer 2 trend. The idea is to enhance Bitcoin’s core layer with faster transactions and smart contracts. It has gathered $2.5 million so far. The low supply draws early buyers hoping it’s the next big breakout.

It just reached Batch 29 with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. GLOBAL LAUNCH release lets users buy at the special price of $0.0016 until August 11. After that, the price returns to the Batch 29 level of $0.0276. Early buyers who bought in batch 1 have seen 2,660% ROI to batch 29.

The heart of its ecosystem is the X1 miner app. It’s live now, with more than 2 million users interacting with the platform firsthand. The app lowers barriers to use, bringing real access to BlockDAG’s features and mining rewards. Technical layers include support for smart contracts and low-code developer tools. That means builders of all types can start making apps and services. Plus, real-world branding shows up in sports partnerships.

Hype Vs Delivery: Bitcoin Hyper Vision Versus BlockDAG Progress Bitcoin Hyper has generated excitement by positioning itself as a future Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin. With $2.5 million already raised, the buzz around its price prediction has drawn in attention from those hoping to catch the next big opportunity. It promises faster transactions and smart contract support on Bitcoin’s network, which is a strong narrative. However, the reality is that Bitcoin Hyper is still in development. There’s no live product, no working ecosystem, and no user experience to show yet. It’s all about what could happen, not what has happened. In comparison, BlockDAG isn’t just imagining a future, it’s actively building it. The difference is clear: while Bitcoin Hyper is gathering interest through marketing and future promises, BlockDAG is already gaining users, revenue, and credibility with real results. Final Verdict Bitcoin Hyper has the potential to grow, but it still needs to prove its technology and deliver a working product. The big ideas are there, and some early supporters believe it could be a major Layer 2 breakthrough. Still, it remains a speculative play, as everything hinges on future development. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is showing what real traction looks like. With a $343 million raise, 24 billion coins sold, a live X1 miner app used by over 2 million people, and strategic partnerships in place, it’s already well on its way.

2025-07-20 14:03:07+00:00,Is El Salvador Lying? IMF Claims the Country Is Not Buying Bitcoin Every Day,"According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)''s first program review report published on July 15, the government of El Salvador has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February 2025. This information was revealed in an official letter signed by the country''s Central Bank President, Douglas Pablo Rodríguez Fuentes, and Finance Minister, Jerson Rogelio Posada Molina, and submitted to the IMF. The letter states that El Salvador''s public sector Bitcoin holdings “have not changed.” Attached documents note that the country''s hot and cold wallet addresses have been handed over to the IMF for auditing and monitoring purposes. This statement clearly contradicts previous statements by President Nayib Bukele and El Salvador''s Bitcoin Office, which claimed that 1 BTC has been purchased daily since November 2022. The Bukele administration claims that the country''s BTC reserves have reached approximately 6,242 BTC, worth around $737 million. Blockchain analysis firm Arkham also provided on-chain data confirming daily transfers of 1 BTC from wallets labeled Binance and Bitfinex. However, the IMF report suggests that these transfers are not new purchases, but rather a consolidation of existing Bitcoin holdings in government wallets. A footnote in the report states, “Increases in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund are due to the consolidation of Bitcoins held in different government wallets.” Related News: What Lies Ahead for Solana (SOL) Prices? Analysis Company Releases Technical Analysis President Bukele has repeatedly stated that they will continue to buy Bitcoin, despite reaching a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. In a post on social media platform X, he said, “Even when the world ostracized us and many abandoned us, these purchases didn''t stop; they won''t stop now, and they won''t stop in the future.” Stacy Herbert, director of the Bitcoin Office, argued in a March post on X that El Salvador continued to buy Bitcoin despite the IMF agreement.

2025-07-20 14:14:24+00:00,"Japan’s Aplus card now lets users turn points into XRP, BTC, and ETH","Aplus cardholders in Japan just got a new way to use their points: by swapping them for crypto. Starting this week, Aplus customers can now convert their reward points into XRP, Bitcoin, or Ether, according to information from the company’s updated loyalty program. That makes Aplus the first major rewards system in the country to offer direct crypto redemptions instead of just the usual cash, merchandise, or airline miles. The new option lets users trade in 2,100 points for over 2,000 yen worth of crypto, roughly $13–$15 USD, depending on the exchange rate. Basically, the program connects daily spending directly to crypto ownership, without requiring people to invest out of pocket. Users don’t need any technical background either, just points and an account with SBI VC Trade or access to the Aplus portal. It’s a small amount, but it turns everyday transactions into a route to XRP, BTC, or ETH, with zero cash upfront. Aplus users earn points from spending and get bonuses for higher usage Every time someone spends 200 yen using an Aplus credit card, they earn one point. Anyone who spends 50,000 yen or more in a single month gets a bonus rate, an extra 0.5% in points. Those points stay active for two years after they’re earned, meaning customers don’t have to rush to redeem them. The crypto integration doesn’t change any of that. It adds one more choice to what people can do with their points. While it might not sound like much, this opens the door for users who’ve never touched crypto before. It doesn’t require them to study blockchain, open a special wallet, or buy crypto directly. They just spend as usual, earn points, and redeem when they’re ready. People can redeem points for XRP, Bitcoin, or Ether by logging in to either the Aplus portal or their account on SBI VC Trade. And even though the crypto is earned through points instead of cash, that doesn’t mean there’s no oversight, as users are still bound by the country’s crypto rules, including tax liabilities. So, let’s say someone redeems their points for Bitcoin, and it goes up in value before they sell it, they will still owe taxes because that’s just how it works under Japanese law . That means users must either keep the assets in SBI VC Trade or manually transfer them to a private wallet. It’s completely on them to handle custody and ensure their crypto is safe. But it’s still uncertain whether people can redeem crypto every month or if there are limits, which will affect how much people use the system over time. There’s also the issue of size. Getting 2,000 yen worth of crypto might not move the needle for big investors, who say the amount is too small to attract serious users. But for people who are new to crypto or just curious, this setup could be the easiest way to start holding XRP, Bitcoin, or Ether without a lot of headaches. Makoto Kobayashi, a senior manager at SBI VC Trade, explained that the goal is to offer a safe and simple entry point for people who’ve never owned crypto before. “Using reward points makes that possible, without asking them to risk cash or deal with exchanges.” Still, clear communication is going to be key if this program’s going to grow. Aplus hasn’t released full guidelines yet, and that’s causing questions to pile up. Users want to know if they can redeem every month, if there’s a minimum balance, or if anything changes based on which crypto they pick. Until those answers come out, some customers might hold off.

That means users must either keep the assets in SBI VC Trade or manually transfer them to a private wallet. It’s completely on them to handle custody and ensure their crypto is safe. But it’s still uncertain whether people can redeem crypto every month or if there are limits, which will affect how much people use the system over time. There’s also the issue of size. Getting 2,000 yen worth of crypto might not move the needle for big investors, who say the amount is too small to attract serious users. But for people who are new to crypto or just curious, this setup could be the easiest way to start holding XRP, Bitcoin, or Ether without a lot of headaches. Makoto Kobayashi, a senior manager at SBI VC Trade, explained that the goal is to offer a safe and simple entry point for people who’ve never owned crypto before. “Using reward points makes that possible, without asking them to risk cash or deal with exchanges.” Still, clear communication is going to be key if this program’s going to grow. Aplus hasn’t released full guidelines yet, and that’s causing questions to pile up. Users want to know if they can redeem every month, if there’s a minimum balance, or if anything changes based on which crypto they pick. Until those answers come out, some customers might hold off.

Key Takeaways: California police are investigating the suspicious disappearance of 74-year-old Naiping Hou. The incident is possibly linked to his family’s crypto wealth. Authorities uncovered fraudulent activity in Hou’s bank accounts and believe someone impersonated him. Hou left his home without his phone on a Monday and never returned. Days later, his silver Toyota Yaris was discovered abandoned near a hiking trail in Rancho Cucamonga. On May 4, he was officially declared missing . Police Probe Fraud in Missing Crypto Investor Case By July 7, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department confirmed its Specialized Investigations Division was treating the case as suspicious, citing evidence of “extensive fraudulent activity” involving Hou’s bank accounts. Investigators revealed that an unknown individual used Hou’s phone and impersonated him to communicate with his family, raising concerns that Hou may have been kidnapped. No suspects have been named, but authorities have not ruled out foul play. Hou’s son, Wen Hou, has offered a $250,000 reward for information that could lead to his father’s safe return. Wen, who has worked as Chief Investment Officer of hedge fund Coincident Capital since 2019, built his fortune in crypto and believes the motive behind his father’s disappearance may be financial. “He had no reason to disappear,” Wen said in an interview with KABC. “I miss him a lot. He’s sort of a guide to my life.” Experts suggest the case fits a growing trend of physical attacks targeting individuals linked to digital wealth. Local and federal agencies now use blockchain forensics to follow the money in these cases. Crypto-Linked Violence Hits Record Levels in 2025 Violent physical attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders, known as “wrench attacks,” are sharply rising in 2025, with 35 cases already reported by July, according to Chainalysis. The Asia-Pacific region has seen some of the worst violence , with countries like Japan, Indonesia, and the Philippines reporting a surge in kidnappings and extortion linked to crypto ownership. Driven by Bitcoin’s recent surge past $122,000, criminals are increasingly shifting from online hacks to real-world violence.

In a new CNBC interview, the Indianapolis-based Sanctuary Wealth says conditions are conspiring to push risk assets such as the stock market to new record-high levels by the end of the year. Mary Ann Bartels, the firm’s chief investment strategist, says investors are not prepared for a huge upside burst for the S&P 500. “We need growth and AI (artificial intelligence), and I think it’s coming. I think it’s going to significantly impact corporate earnings, productivity, and it’s going to show up in the equity markets. It’s not just a bull market here. It’s a bull market globally. You’re seeing European markets break out. I think you’re going to get the Japanese market to break out. It’s a global secular bull market driven by all this new innovation from AI, to blockchain, to crypto, to Web3. And I don’t think all of this is yet priced in to the market, and you can see, we’re already in a summer melt-up. The market is not positioned for this yet.” Bartels says she agrees with the sentiment that technological advancements in AI and Web3 will usher in a disinflationary trend, forcing the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy. “I do think rates are trending down, and can go much lower than people expect. Right now, we’re in heightened fear that tariffs are going to bring inflation, and I think over time, especially trending into next year, we can get rates down. And that’s going to be another stimulus for risk assets, for the equity market, for the crypto market.” As for her price targets for the S&P 500, Bartels says, “I’m comfortable getting to year-end at 7,000, and I think in the first quarter of next year, we might even be at 7,200.” Sanctuary Wealth is an independent wealth management platform that works with 495 licensed professionals and 120 partner firms across 30 states.

2025-07-20 14:40:11+00:00,Ethereum enters final wave of multi-year bull run,"Ether has broken above $3,800 for the first time since December 2024, according to data from CoinGecko. The surge puts Ethereum’s market cap over $450 billion, officially locking in its strongest price level in seven months. This surge comes as momentum builds across altcoins, with the Altcoin Season Index climbing to 47, up from 29 just last week. The combined altcoin market cap now stands at $1.55 trillion. Over the last seven days, Ethereum has climbed steadily, pushing up to $3,600 before finally pushing past the $3.8K line. That puts the month-on-month gain at 45.48%, a massive push for the second-largest crypto. Gert Van Lagen, a Dutch analyst who specializes in wave-based market structures, said Ethereum is closing in on the final stage of a long-term bull cycle. “We’re entering the fifth wave,” Gert posted on X on Sunday, “and based on the structure, this wave can carry us to $10,000.” Source: Gert Van Lagen Ethereum enters final wave of multi-year bull run Gert’s breakdown leans on Elliott wave theory, which maps out five-wave price cycles shaped by crowd behavior. Based on his bi-weekly chart analysis, Ethereum began this current cycle in 2022 and is now moving through the last of the five waves. The early part of the cycle included a strong rally (wave one), a correction between 2022 and 2023 (wave two), followed by an extended rise (wave three), and then a slow flat stretch (wave four). Right now, Ethereum is inside wave five, which typically comes with one last aggressive price run before the entire cycle resets. According to Gert, Ethereum’s latest climb forms “subwave a” of wave five. He expects a minor dip next to retest the breakout level—that would form “subwave b.” After that, the blow-off “subwave c” could push prices well beyond current levels. He sees $10,000 as a realistic endpoint for this entire wave sequence, stretching from 2019 through 2025. Ether is still the second-largest crypto on earth, sitting only behind Bitcoin, and it currently holds an 11.1% market share. Its market cap now stands at $441.14 billion, just slightly under the $450B peak but still well above its mid-June level.

According to Gert, Ethereum’s latest climb forms “subwave a” of wave five. He expects a minor dip next to retest the breakout level—that would form “subwave b.” After that, the blow-off “subwave c” could push prices well beyond current levels. He sees $10,000 as a realistic endpoint for this entire wave sequence, stretching from 2019 through 2025. Ether is still the second-largest crypto on earth, sitting only behind Bitcoin, and it currently holds an 11.1% market share. Its market cap now stands at $441.14 billion, just slightly under the $450B peak but still well above its mid-June level.

2025-07-20 15:45:17+00:00,Fed Governor Christopher Waller Says Central Bank Should Cut Rates by Next Meeting Amid Slowdown in GDP,"A member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors says the central bank should slash interest rates by the next Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which is scheduled for July 29th. In a recent speech given at New York University, Fed Governor Christopher Waller provided three main reasons that the Fed Funds Rate should be reduced by 25 basis points (bps) immediately, rather than remain paused at 4.25% to 4.50%. The economist addresses tariffs, labor markets and a “host of data” that suggests that GDP will continue to be low. On tariffs, Waller said they are not as inflationary as most believe, and will likely only lead to a “one-off” surge in prices rather than a sustained climb in inflationary pressures. Waller says a rate cut now rather than months down the road, as most FOMC members are aiming for, would front-run an otherwise cooling economic climate in the US. “I also believe – and I hope the case I have made is convincing – that the risks to the economy are weighted toward cutting sooner rather than later. If the slowing of economic and employment growth were to accelerate and warrant moving toward a more neutral setting more quickly, then waiting until September or even later in the year would risk us falling behind the curve of appropriate policy. However, if we cut our target range in July and subsequent employment and inflation data point toward fewer cuts, we would have the option of holding policy steady for one or more meetings. For this reason, I believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC’s policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now.” Waller also says he’s not expecting a rebound in GDP in the second half of 2025, and based on current forecasts, he’s more so looking for an annual GDP growth of around 1%, which would be down from 2024’s 2.4%. “Given the ups and downs of monthly indicators of GDP this year, we can best get a view of the performance of the economy by combining the first and second-quarter numbers. With the data in hand, estimates suggest that real GDP increased at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the first half of this year, compared with 2.8 percent in the second half of 2024. That comparison is important not only for the extent of the slowdown, which is considerable, but also because it is well below most estimates of the potential growth rate of the economy. Based on forward-looking indicators, I don’t expect a rebound in the second half – in fact, most forecasts suggest that real GDP growth will remain around 1 percent at an annual rate.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

On July 18th, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law with the aim of strengthening the US dollar’s reserve currency status and making America the “undisputed leader” in digital assets. The law establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar, requiring each token to be fully backed by liquid assets such as cash or short-term US Treasuries. In a new CNBC interview, Armstrong says the law has put the US in a position to move money efficiently across the globe. “This stablecoin bill passing into law is really a financial revolution for America. It means crypto can finally start updating the financial system, especially for our payments, which are running on these creaky old systems that are decades old. Now, every payment in our economy can be fast, cheap and global – under one second, one cent, anywhere in the world.” According to Armstrong, he now expects blue-chip companies to start using stablecoin payments to reduce transaction costs. “Now that we have clear legislation, we’re going to see the Fortune 500 really start to adopt stablecoins. We’ve started to see this a little bit already even with the news that this was going to pass in the near future. Coinbase just launched an integration with Shopify, for instance, and we’ve seen announcements from Walmart and Amazon. Almost every Fortune 500 company is now coming in and starting to look at stablecoin payments. This is a big opportunity for us. It’s a TAM (total addressable market) expansion for our business.

2025-07-20 16:59:03+00:00,UK to Sell Billions of Seized Bitcoin to Tackle Budget Deficit,"The UK government is preparing to sell a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC), valued at several billion pounds. These digital assets were taken over the years during police investigations into crimes. This decision comes as UK leaders are seeking new sources of funding amid rising national debt and economic uncertainty. Seized Bitcoin Could Provide Billions in Revenue Over the years, UK authorities have seized large amounts of digital assets linked to criminal activity . In many cases, these assets are stored securely until legal proceedings are complete. Once the courts approve, the government can sell the digital assets. While police agencies carry out the seizures and sales, the Treasury closely monitors the process. These funds would typically be shared between the government and law enforcement. However, any money owed to fraud victims would be paid out first. Analysts estimate that the Treasury could earn billions from these upcoming sales. One of the most significant Bitcoin seizures happened in 2018, tied to Chinese fraudster Jian Wen. That case is still under review, with the victims requesting restitution. If the government were to keep half of the remaining haul, it could be worth as much as £2.6 billion. Former Chancellor Norman Lamont has publicly suggested that the money should be spent quickly. Others, however, warned against rushing, reminding people of the 1999 gold sale that cost the UK billions after prices later soared. Experts Say Seized Digital Assets Are a Hidden Resource A growing number of experts believe that seized digital assets, such as Bitcoin, could become a significant source of revenue for governments. This idea is gaining traction globally, as more governments explore ways to convert confiscated cryptocurrency into financial gains rather than letting it sit unused. To prepare for these large-scale crypto asset sales, the UK Home Office has initiated the necessary process. The agency has hired a private firm that will oversee the secure storage, handling, and liquidation of digital assets. The original request for bids offered up to £40 million in commission to the chosen provider. However, the first round of bids failed to meet the government’s strict requirements. Despite this delay, the Home Office plans to relaunch the process in a revised form. Political Debate Over Bitcoin’s Role As the government prepares to sell the seized crypto, political voices have been divided. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has proposed that Britain establish a national Bitcoin reserve , a plan similar to one backed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The Labour Party has rejected this idea, citing Bitcoin’s price volatility as a significant risk. Still, the financial appeal is clear. Cardiff University professor Michael Levi, a leading expert in asset seizures, warns that the process is not quick. Once digital assets are seized, authorities often need to hold them securely for extended periods until all legal challenges are resolved.

He warned that pushing digital assets at home could erode trust in the dollar. Schiff said that, while some may cheer weaker paper money, it will be gold that wins when Bitcoin finally stumbles. Related Reading: Whales? No, Newbies: Surge In New BTC Holders Fuels Market Rally—Study Dollar Confidence In Question According To Schiff, encouraging domestic investment in Bitcoin and crypto “undermines the US economy and speeds up the dollar’s collapse.” He argued that millions of Americans buying digital tokens won’t prop up the world’s main reserve currency. Schiff believes real damage comes when retail investors swap dollars for speculative coins, tipping the scales against greenbacks in global markets. By promoting domestic investment in Bitcoin and crypto, Trump is helping undermine the U.S. economy and speed up the dollar’s collapse. Bitcoiners may cheer, as most bought Bitcoin to profit from a dollar crash. But ironically, gold will be the winner as Bitcoin will crash too. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Ponzi Scheme Allegations Schiff described recent cryptocurrency bills as little more than a way to “cloak Bitcoin—nothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme—in the trappings of legitimacy.” He claimed insiders use new laws to drive prices up, then get out at higher levels. “The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It’s a legislative low point,” he wrote on X. Stablecoins Under Scrutiny Based on reports, Schiff sees stablecoin plans as a false promise for dollar dominance. He pointed out that a stablecoin backed by any fiat currency offers no real edge. That stability, he warned, will soon give way. He also pointed out tht dollar‑backed coins are only as stable as the underlying money. The main purpose of the “landmark” crypto bills is to cloak Bitcoin—nothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme—in the trappings of legitimacy. The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It’s a legislative low point. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Echoes Of Tulip Mania Invoking Charles Mackay’s 1630s tale, Schiff compared the digital token craze to the Dutch tulip bubble. He quoted Mackay: “They go mad in herds, and only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.” In that era, bulb prices soared before crashing overnight. Schiff said swapping tulips for Bitcoin makes the same point. Related Reading: $57 Billion Mistake? Ex‑Ripple Engineer Reveals XRP Investment Blunder Gold Set To Benefit Schiff predicted that, even if Bitcoin supporters toast short‑term dollar weakness, gold will be the real winner.

No, Newbies: Surge In New BTC Holders Fuels Market Rally—Study Dollar Confidence In Question According To Schiff, encouraging domestic investment in Bitcoin and crypto “undermines the US economy and speeds up the dollar’s collapse.” He argued that millions of Americans buying digital tokens won’t prop up the world’s main reserve currency. Schiff believes real damage comes when retail investors swap dollars for speculative coins, tipping the scales against greenbacks in global markets. By promoting domestic investment in Bitcoin and crypto, Trump is helping undermine the U.S. economy and speed up the dollar’s collapse. Bitcoiners may cheer, as most bought Bitcoin to profit from a dollar crash. But ironically, gold will be the winner as Bitcoin will crash too. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Ponzi Scheme Allegations Schiff described recent cryptocurrency bills as little more than a way to “cloak Bitcoin—nothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme—in the trappings of legitimacy.” He claimed insiders use new laws to drive prices up, then get out at higher levels. “The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It’s a legislative low point,” he wrote on X. Stablecoins Under Scrutiny Based on reports, Schiff sees stablecoin plans as a false promise for dollar dominance. He pointed out that a stablecoin backed by any fiat currency offers no real edge. That stability, he warned, will soon give way. He also pointed out tht dollar‑backed coins are only as stable as the underlying money. The main purpose of the “landmark” crypto bills is to cloak Bitcoin—nothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme—in the trappings of legitimacy. The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It’s a legislative low point. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Echoes Of Tulip Mania Invoking Charles Mackay’s 1630s tale, Schiff compared the digital token craze to the Dutch tulip bubble. He quoted Mackay: “They go mad in herds, and only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.” In that era, bulb prices soared before crashing overnight. Schiff said swapping tulips for Bitcoin makes the same point. Related Reading: $57 Billion Mistake? Ex‑Ripple Engineer Reveals XRP Investment Blunder Gold Set To Benefit Schiff predicted that, even if Bitcoin supporters toast short‑term dollar weakness, gold will be the real winner. He said that shaky digital schemes will collapse at some point, just as tulip contracts became worthless. When that happens, he expects gold prices to climb.

2025-07-20 17:30:27+00:00,How Bitcoin Is Reacting To The Falling S&P 500 Volatility Index: Expert,"It’s barely weeks into the second half of 2025, and it is fair to say that the Bitcoin and global financial markets have almost seen it all this year. From global trade wars to actual disputes between nations (involving serious military action), the markets have been subject to different forms of external pressure throughout the year. As a result, the world has seen a sheer amount of correlation and direct relationship between the traditional financial markets and the crypto market. While the US equities market and Bitcoin have not particularly moved in tandem in recent months, there is no denying the existence of a relationship between the asset classes. What Does The Falling Traditional Volatility Mean For BTC? In a new post on social media platform X, Alphractal CEO and founder Joao Wedson delved into the relationship between Bitcoin and the US equities market (through the S&P 500 index). According to the crypto expert, the premier cryptocurrency is exhibiting low correlation with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which tracks the market’s expectations for the volatility of the S&P 500 Index. For context, volatility refers to how quickly prices change within a short period and is often seen as a way to gauge market sentiment. Wedson mentioned that the VIX Index, also known as the fear index, is widely used as a risk thermometer among participants in the traditional financial markets. According to Wedson, the price of Bitcoin historically tends to move more independently and significantly in the following year whenever it is negatively correlated with the S&P 500 Index, especially during periods of low VIX. This increased volatility has often translated into significant price rallies in the past, according to the analyst. Wedson said: In other words: don’t waste hours analyzing BTC vs. S&P 500 when BTC’s correlation with the VIX is low or negative — that’s usually when BTC has a higher chance of entering an explosive phase. The on-chain analyst said that on the flip side, when the VIX is high, it is worth looking at the relationship between Bitcoin and US equities markets, as fear in the latter can influence the behavior of the former. However, Wedson noted that the VIX is currently declining, and as such, the S&P 500 Index might not offer much help in analyzing Bitcoin’s next move. Wedson concluded that the more BTC dissociates from traditional volatility (VIX), the stronger it is as an independent asset. Ultimately, this could be a positive sign for the Bitcoin price and present fresh opportunities for investors looking to get into the market.

This is a notable drop from previous estimates, which suggested that the country held nearly 200,000 BTC. Concerns Over Missing Government Reserves The declaration followed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request submitted on March 24 by independent journalist L0la L33tz. A letter dated July 15 from the Office of General Counsel confirmed that the released records originated from the Asset Forfeiture Division. While most of the report was made public, some portions were redacted for legal and security reasons. These included information on specific storage procedures, wallet addresses, and security systems. The documents revealed that the U.S. Marshals Service currently holds 28,988 BTC, valued at approximately $3.45 billion based on current market rates. Further, individual wallet balances range from $4,464.48 to $100.95 million and $43.70 million. In criminal investigations involving digital assets, seized cryptocurrencies must undergo a formal court-ordered forfeiture process before they can become government property. The USMS is responsible for managing, safeguarding, and liquidating such assets on behalf of federal agencies. The figure disclosed got attention because it accounts for only 15% of what many believed to be the total U.S. government Bitcoin reserves, previously estimated at nearly 200,000 BTC. This raised concerns that it may have quietly sold about 85% of its holdings. Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, who has long advocated for the creation of a national strategic BTC reserve, partly using forfeited cryptocurrency, expressed similar concern on X: “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins.” Did The Government Sell Off Its BTC? L0la L33tz later clarified the situation by explaining the difference between seized and forfeited assets. She noted that confiscated cryptocurrencies are not considered government property until a court officially transfers their ownership to the state. Only then can the U.S. Marshals Service legally manage or sell them. As such, the reported figure of 28,988 BTC refers only to surrendered assets. The remaining 170,000 BTC that many believed had been sold are still held as impounded property and have not yet been processed through the legal system. Data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence shows that the U.S. government controls approximately 198,000 BTC, currently valued at more than $23 billion. L33tz pointed out that tracking platforms often overstate holdings by including seized assets that have not yet been legally transferred. She cited the 94,000 BTC linked to the Bitfinex hack as an example. Although these funds are under government control, they have not yet been legally processed and cannot yet be sold.

By 2028, ADA/USD could decline and reach $2.63. By 2031, Cardano might reach a maximum price of $8.61 Cardano is a third-generation blockchain platform launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. Designed for decentralized applications and smart contracts, it uses Ouroboros—a unique, energy-efficient Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. Cardano’s two-layer architecture separates transactions from smart contracts, enhancing scalability and flexibility. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is used for transaction fees, staking, and governance, allowing holders to influence the platform’s future. Emphasizing a research-driven, peer-reviewed development approach, Cardano aims to tackle blockchain challenges like scalability and sustainability, making it a strong alternative to platforms like Ethereum. Perhaps you’re wondering: with its innovative technology, can Cardano’s ADA reach new all-time highs soon? Let’s uncover what the future holds for Cardano. Overview Cryptocurrency Cardano Token ADA Price $0.8519 Market Cap $30.19 Billion Trading Volume (24-hour) $1.22Million Circulating Supply 45 Billion ADA All-time High $3.10 on Sept 02, 2021 All-time Low $0.01735 on Oct 01, 2017 24-hour High $0.8593 24-hour Low $0.8125 Cardano price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 14.21% 50-day SMA $ 0.64928 14-Day RSI 76.95 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 18/30 (60%) Cardano ADA recovers slightly ADA price analysis 1-day chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView Cardano’s daily chart shows a strong uptrend as price rides the upper Bollinger Band above the 20-day SMA, with RSI deep into overbought territory around 81 signaling stretched momentum. MACD remains bullish but shows signs of waning histogram strength. A sustained close above $0.88 would clear short-term resistance and likely accelerate gains toward $0.95. Conversely, profit-taking could trigger a pullback toward the middle band near $0.68, where daily SMA support resides. Watch for a contraction of Bollinger width and an RSI decline below 70 as early signs of consolidation before the next directional move. ADA price analysis 4-hour chart ADAUSD chart by TradingView On the four-hour chart, ADA has climbed from roughly $0.60 last month into a congestion zone just below the upper Bollinger Band near $0.86. The 20-period simple moving average around $0.83 has provided dynamic support during this advance. MACD lines sit in positive territory but are converging, signaling that upward momentum may be pausing. Balance of Power remains slightly bullish, suggesting accumulative pressure ahead of a decisive move. A sustained break above $0.86 could open the path toward $0.90 or higher, while failure to clear this cap may trigger a retracement to the mid‐band or the $0.80 level.

The 20-day SMA near $0.68 has provided solid support throughout the rally. On the four-hour timeframe, momentum is slowing as MACD histograms shrink and price tests resistance at $0.88 while remaining above the 20-period EMA around $0.83. In the near term, expect a corrective pullback toward the Bollinger mid-band or $0.80 support before another leg up. A decisive break above $0.88 opens the path to $0.95, while failure risks a drop to $0.75. Is Cardano a good investment? Cardano (ADA) presents a mixed investment opportunity. It is a third-generation blockchain that aims to solve scalability issues and enhance security through its Proof-of-Stake mechanism. While some analysts predict significant price increases by 2030, others caution that it remains a high-risk investment due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. Investors should consider their risk tolerance and research before investing, as Cardano’s future performance is uncertain and contingent on market conditions and technological advancements. What will Cardano be worth in 2025? ADA might reach a maximum price of $5.97, with an average trading price of about $5.17 and a minimum price of $5.03. What will Cardano be worth in 2030?

Firms that specialize in merger arbitrage are looking at billions of dollars in windfall after a 20-month court arbitration finally concluded on Friday, Bloomberg reports . Merger arbitrage is a trading strategy that involves betting on the outcome of a merger or acquisition, typically by taking long and/or short positions in the stocks of the companies involved. According to a Morgan Stanley calculation, shares of Hess were the most widely held position for merger arbitrages in the US, collectively amounting to $10 billion worth of positions. Notably among those betting on the acquisition were Ken Griffin’s Citadel Advisors, Adage Capital and HBK Investments. Roy Behren, co-chief investment officer at Westchester Capital, says the firm held roughly $350 million in Hess shares in anticipation of the acquisition “I’ve been waiting forever for this to happen. It took a year and a half, but I think the right outcome was achieved… The Hess stake was the largest position we have had in the past 15 years. The arbitration panel ruled the way our consultants and analysts expected.” Citadel and HBK each had the equivalent of $1 billion in shares, according to the firms’ latest filings, says Bloomberg.

2025-07-20 19:11:28+00:00,"ETH''s ‘Most Hated’ Rally Could Trigger $331M in Liquidations Near $4K, Says Analyst","Ether''s summer surge has ignited fierce debate among market analysts, with many pointing to mounting short positions and shifting capital flows as key drivers behind the rally. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is now trading near $3,755, up nearly 5.7% in the past 24 hours and more than 25% over the past week, according to CoinDesk Data. ETH holders have welcomed the rally, and some analysts believe it could accelerate further if a short squeeze forces bearish traders to close their positions. “$ETH is the most hated rally right now,” posted Crypto Banter on X, referring to the unusually high level of bearish positioning in the market. According to the CoinGlass data cited by the analyst, approximately $331 million worth of short positions could be liquidated if ether hits the psychologically significant $4,000 level. That liquidation cascade would likely accelerate price momentum in a classic feedback loop. Others see ether''s outperformance as a clear sign of shifting market dynamics. Pentoshi, a well-followed trader on X, pointed to the steepest weekly drop in BTC dominance in four years as evidence of capital rotating into ETH. “Enjoy the next few weeks,” the pseudonymous analyst wrote, adding that ether''s current trajectory resembles a “melt up” — a term used to describe rapid price increases driven more by fear of missing out (FOMO) than fundamentals. Pentoshi also noted a new structural tailwind: the emergence of ETH treasury strategy companies, which are aggressively accumulating ether on their balance sheets. “Now we have ETH treasury companies that are only a month old and into buying, competing to get 1% of the supply each,” he said. While not naming names, this likely refers to publicly traded firms like Bitmine Immersion Technologies and SharpLink Gaming, whose large-scale ETH acquisitions have drawn increasing attention. Adding to the chorus, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen highlighted that altcoins continue to underperform relative to ether. “Alt/BTC pairs go up but they are lagging ETH/BTC,” he posted, suggesting that ether is capturing a disproportionate share of market flows.

This breakout unleashed strong buying momentum, pushing ETH to highs near $3,800. The platform’s analysis identified a well-formed cup-shaped pattern that developed over the past six months, which often precedes significant upside moves. The volume profile indicates significant prior trading activity in the $2,500 to $3,000 zone, suggesting that former resistance has become strong support. Ethereum price levels to watch At the same time, market sentiment remains upbeat. A TrendSpider poll also found that 80.5% of respondents expect Ethereum to reach $4,000 in 2025, with 41% predicting $5,000 and 26.5% targeting $6,000. More bullish projections see ETH climbing to $7,000 (17.5%) or even $8,000 (13.5%). Ethereum’s momentum is also being fueled by institutional inflows and whale activity. For instance, on July 18, Ethereum ETFs recorded $402.5 million in net inflows, surpassing Bitcoin’s $363.4 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA driving 98% of the activity and pushing total ETH ETF assets to $18.37 billion. On-chain data showed a whale purchased 13,462 ETH (about $50 million) at $3,715. In comparison, futures open interest rose 12.79% month-over-month to $786 billion, with leveraged traders such as James Wynn reportedly taking $12.1 million in 25x long positions.

2025-07-20 20:00:26+00:00,"VanEck CEO Predicts Rise of ‘Super Apps’ Like Robinhood, Kraken and X Will Put Pressure on TradFi’s Payments System","The chief executive of exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider VanEck is predicting that “super apps” will challenge traditional finance’s payments system. In a new interview with CNBC Television, VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck says that apps that offer support for stablecoins will soon begin to put pressure on traditional methods of payments. According to Van Eck, since stablecoins skip out on intermediaries such as Visa and Mastercard that charge about 3% in fees for payments, the super apps could serve as viable alternatives. “I definitely think that this will put cost pressure on the payments system because it is cheaper and allows all these competitors to come into the market, whether it’s a Kraken, whether it’s a Robinhood, whether it’s an X, there are going to be a lot of super apps.” On Friday, President Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, which establishes a stringent regulatory framework for firms issuing payment stablecoins. Van Eck goes on to note that while the stablecoin issuer Circle has done well so far this year, new competition is gearing up to enter the space. “It’ll be several quarters before it’ll impact earnings, either to the positive or the negative. But stocks are kind of moving in anticipation of that right now. And you see the incumbents – Ethereum has had a great month; Circle, the one public stablecoin company, has had a great run since its IPO (initial public offering).

2025-07-20 20:38:13+00:00,Bitcoin Darknet Giant Abacus Vanishes – Was It a Massive Exit Scam?,"Abacus Market, once the largest Bitcoin-enabled Western DNM, has abruptly disappeared, leaving its vendors and buyers in limbo amid suspicions of a large-scale exit scam. According to blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs, Abacus Market went offline in early July 2025, and took down its clearnet mirror and all related infrastructure without warning. Abacus Market’s Mysterious Disappearance During its four years of operation, Abacus handled nearly $100 million in Bitcoin-based sales. However, the platform was hit by several user complaints in late June about stalled withdrawals. TRM Labs said that this is a classic red flag in the darknet ecosystem, which often precedes an exit scam. The marketplace’s administrator, known as “Vito,” attributed these withdrawal issues to an influx of new users following Archetyp Market’s seizure by law enforcement and ongoing DDoS attacks. Despite these assurances on dark web forums, many users remained skeptical. This was reflected in a sharp decline in deposits from an average of $230,000 daily across 1,400 transactions in early June to just $13,000 daily across 100 deposits by early July. Launched in 2021 and initially known as Alphabet Market, Abacus rebranded and steadily rose in prominence. While it catered to a global audience, it particularly focused on the Australian market with tailored moderators and cultural messaging. Unlike competitors, Abacus operated with a centralized deposit wallet and multisignature capabilities while supporting Bitcoin and Monero. Its market share grew rapidly following the closures of other major darknet markets, and climbed from 10% in 2022 to over 70% by 2024. For instance, the closure of Archetyp in June 2025 drove even more traffic to Abacus, with its monthly sales volume spiking to $6.3 million. This surge may have inadvertently sealed its fate. TRM Labs explained that the sudden disappearance of Abacus was likely an intentional exit by its operators, who may have chosen to cash out and vanish rather than risk law enforcement attention as the market’s size and visibility increased. The timing aligns with a pattern observed in the darknet ecosystem, where markets that reach peak prominence often face a choice between risking seizure and preserving personal safety and profits. While it remains possible that law enforcement seized Abacus covertly, Dread forum administrator Hugbunter, who maintained close contact with the project’s staff, believes the shutdown was not linked to an official takedown. Historically, darknet administrators who exit at the height of their market’s popularity, whether through exit scams like Evolution Market or voluntary closures like Agora Market, have largely evaded law enforcement capture. Russian Darknet Markets Rise TRM Labs also noted that despite major darknet platforms shutting down, the ecosystem continues to adapt quickly. After Hydra Market’s 2022 closure , new Russian-language darknet markets emerged and have managed to capture over 97% of global darknet drug revenues by 2024. While some Western darknet operators have tried rebrands or exit scams post-seizure, complete marketplace rebuilds now appear less frequent.

2025-07-20 20:40:28+00:00,"OPERS increased its Palantir stake to 908,712 shares after the stock jumped 80% in H1 2025","Ohio’s biggest pension fund is moving deeper into high-volatility tech, while quietly stepping away from ride-hailing. OPERS, short for Ohio Public Employees Retirement System, added major positions in Palantir Technologies and MicroStrategy during the second quarter of 2025, while cutting its stake in Lyft, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of December 31, 2024, OPERS reported $155.6 billion in total assets, ranking it as the 14th largest public pension fund in the United States. OPERS doubles down on Palantir and Strategy, exits Lyft Palantir Technologies led the charge. OPERS bought an extra 171,441 shares of the company during Q2, raising its total to 908,712 shares. This came as Palantir’s stock rose 80% in the first half of 2025, leaving the broader S&P 500’s 5.5% gain in the dust. The momentum hasn’t stopped either—shares are up 13% so far in the third quarter, compared to a modest 1.5% increase in the S&P. Palantir’s surge began after it was added to the S&P 500 in September, a move that pushed index-tracking funds to buy shares automatically. The company also continued to deliver strong earnings, and this past Thursday, its stock hit an all-time high of $155.68. MicroStrategy, which now refers to itself as Strategy for the love of Bitcoin, was another big buy. OPERS added 21,499 shares, lifting its position to 101,880 shares by the end of June. Strategy’s bet is purely on Bitcoin. The firm has become the largest corporate holder of the OG crypto and has sold more than $3 billion in preferred shares to buy even more. Those preferred carry interest rates as high as 11.5%, a figure that raised eyebrows. “Investors are questioning whether the yield is enough compensation, especially when there’s no reliable source of cash to pay dividends,” said Barron’s, which flagged the concerns in a recent note. Strategy disagrees, pointing out that its Bitcoin holdings are worth far more than what it owes. In the meantime, its stock rose 40% in the first half of 2025, with an additional 4.7% gain in Q3 so far. Meanwhile, OPERS took a step back from Lyft , selling 58,881 shares and dropping its total stake to 166,628 shares, despite a 22% rise in Lyft’s stock during the first half of the year. But the ride-hailing company has lost ground since July, with shares down 6.3% in Q3. February’s earnings report was mixed, and though May’s Q1 update featured a bigger share repurchase plan, it wasn’t enough to convince OPERS to stay.

2025-07-20 21:30:29+00:00,Who Owns the Most Bitcoin in 2025?,"With many traditional organizations, cryptocurrency exchanges, and individuals deeply entrenched in the Bitcoin (BTC) ecosystem, the question of “who owns the most BTC?” has emerged. A close examination of Bitcoin’s ownership map in 2025 reveals a mix of concentration and quiet decentralization. Bitcoin Demonstrates Solid Footing This July, Bitcoin has proven to be resilient on multiple occasions, crossing several all-time highs (ATHs) in a week. This positive sentiment has also seeped into spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), with this class of investment recording massive inflows consistently . A significant drop in exchange-held reserves primarily backs the daily inflows into these spot ETFs. This outlook suggests rising investor confidence and long-term accumulation. At the time of this writing, the BTC price was $118,415.90, corresponding to a 0.5% increase over the last 24 hours. It is worth noting that Bitcoin has earlier surged to $123,000 before dropping to its current level. Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Show Activity Much of the growth recorded by the coin this past week has been attributed to the sudden movement of 20,000 BTC from two wallets from the Satoshi era. The stash, valued at over $2.1 billion, has remained untouched since 2011. This means that the Bitcoin wallets have been dormant since that time. Upon resuming activity, they have transferred their funds to new, unidentified addresses. Blockchain intelligence firm Arkham highlighted a recent transfer of $8.6 billion worth of Bitcoin from eight wallets that had remained untouched since 2011. It noted that a technical reason may have been the driving force behind the activity. In the meantime, the reason for the sudden transfers remains unknown. However, these events of large dormant wallets waking up are another indicator of the highly concentrated distribution of BTC power. Binance Leads on List of Top BTC Holders in 2025 Binance’s primary cold wallet, holding as much as 248,600 BTC, happens to top the list of top Bitcoin holders in 2025. This represents approximately 1.25% of Bitcoin’s total circulating supply and is valued at over $26 billion. Robinhood’s cold wallet, containing approximately 140,600 BTC worth roughly $15 billion, is next in line after Binance. Following closely is Bitfinex’s cold wallet, which stores about 130,010 BTC, although it is expected to hold more if not for some minor fluctuations.

On Monday its price soared to a record $123,000. Bitcoin’s Price Flies To New Highs Beyond reaching fresh all-time highs, Bitcoin daily trading volume drenched exchanges as the average trade price began to settle down to the $117,000 level. Investing in BTC has been very profitable for nest egg retirement savers, casual retail altcoin traders, and serious corporate investors, like Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. Bitcoin’s market cap in realized gains tapped the $1 trillion mark over the week. In other words, the total value of all the circulating Bitcoin, cost based over the last time each piece of it moved on chain, was a mouth-watering $1 trillion in July. Peter Schiff Says Hello Dollar Weakness But Euro Pacific Capital founder and chief, Peter Schiff, wasn’t impressed by Bitcoin’s feat. He has made a name for himself among crypto investors by trash talking Internet hash currencies. Even as Congress moved to pass the stablecoin bill named the GENIUS Act, he characterized the move as a cynical ploy by special interests to “hype Bitcoin” and offload worthless tokens onto the public at a profit for early investors. Meanwhile, as BTC prices traced historic records, the foreign equities expert and gold bug said that it’s not Bitcoin’s strength, but the dollar’s weakness reflected in the new record prices. Source: X His argument to advance this theory is that Bitcoin is only marking records in dollars, “not in euros or Swiss francs.” He contends that only proves the dollar is falling behind its European cousins. He also pointed to what he sees as a bubble of over wrought crypto speculation stateside. Bitcoin investors like that it moves up in price when the dollar weakens in the international currency float or over Fed inflation to target lower interest rates. But Schiff warns it’s a “Ponzi” scheme built on a house of cards.

Peter Schiff Says Hello Dollar Weakness But Euro Pacific Capital founder and chief, Peter Schiff, wasn’t impressed by Bitcoin’s feat. He has made a name for himself among crypto investors by trash talking Internet hash currencies. Even as Congress moved to pass the stablecoin bill named the GENIUS Act, he characterized the move as a cynical ploy by special interests to “hype Bitcoin” and offload worthless tokens onto the public at a profit for early investors. Meanwhile, as BTC prices traced historic records, the foreign equities expert and gold bug said that it’s not Bitcoin’s strength, but the dollar’s weakness reflected in the new record prices. Source: X His argument to advance this theory is that Bitcoin is only marking records in dollars, “not in euros or Swiss francs.” He contends that only proves the dollar is falling behind its European cousins. He also pointed to what he sees as a bubble of over wrought crypto speculation stateside. Bitcoin investors like that it moves up in price when the dollar weakens in the international currency float or over Fed inflation to target lower interest rates. But Schiff warns it’s a “Ponzi” scheme built on a house of cards. The post Peter Schiff: Bitcoin Price Record Highlights US Dollar Weakness appeared first on CryptoPotato ."
2025-07-20 22:25:24+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Plunge: What’s Behind the Critical Drop Below $117,000?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge: What’s Behind the Critical Drop Below $117,000? The cryptocurrency market is once again sending ripples of concern through its community as the Bitcoin price experienced a significant dip, falling below the crucial $117,000 mark. For many investors, this sudden movement sparks questions and uncertainty. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just beginning your journey, understanding the dynamics behind such fluctuations in the Bitcoin price is essential to navigating this volatile yet potentially rewarding landscape. Let’s delve into what exactly happened and what it could mean for the future of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What Just Happened to the Bitcoin Price? According to real-time market monitoring, the Bitcoin price has notably fallen below $117,000, marking a point of concern for many in the digital asset space. Specifically, Bitcoin (BTC) was observed trading at $116,994.18 on the Binance USDT market. This immediate drop highlights the inherent volatility that defines the cryptocurrency market, where prices can shift dramatically within short periods. The $117,000 level is more than just a number; it often represents a psychological and technical support level for traders. A breach of such a level can trigger further sell-offs as automated trading systems and human traders react to the broken support. This recent movement suggests a bearish sentiment taking hold, at least in the short term, compelling market participants to reassess their positions and strategies. To put this recent movement into perspective, consider the recent price action: Metric Value (Approximate) Significance Current Bitcoin Price $116,994.18 Immediate trading value on Binance USDT. Previous 24h High ~ $118,500 Indicates recent peak before the decline. Key Support Level Breached $117,000 Psychological and technical level. Market Sentiment Indicator Increased Fear Reflects investor anxiety following the drop. This data confirms a notable shift in market dynamics, making it imperative to understand the underlying causes. Why Did the Bitcoin Price Take a Hit? Unpacking the Factors When the Bitcoin price experiences a sudden downturn, it’s rarely due to a single factor. A confluence of macroeconomic pressures, regulatory developments, market sentiment, and technical indicators often plays a role. Understanding these elements can provide a clearer picture of why the Bitcoin price moved as it did. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic conditions, such as rising inflation, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions, often influence risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets show signs of instability, investors tend to de-risk, pulling funds from more volatile assets, which can impact the Bitcoin price . Regulatory Uncertainty: The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving under the watchful eye of regulators worldwide. News regarding stricter regulations, potential bans, or even debates about how digital assets should be classified can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) in the market, leading to sell-offs and affecting the Bitcoin price . Market Sentiment and Liquidations: The crypto market is highly driven by sentiment. A cascade of liquidations, especially in leveraged positions, can amplify price movements. When the Bitcoin price drops, it can trigger automatic selling of leveraged long positions, pushing the price down further in a self-reinforcing cycle. Technical Breakdown: From a technical analysis perspective, breaking below a significant support level like $117,000 often signals a shift in market structure from bullish to bearish. Traders who rely on charts and patterns might interpret this as a signal to sell, contributing to the downward momentum of the Bitcoin price . These factors, whether acting individually or in concert, create a complex environment where price movements are a direct reflection of collective investor behavior and external influences on the Bitcoin price . Navigating the Volatility: What Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for You? A significant drop in the Bitcoin price can be unsettling, especially for those new to the cryptocurrency space. However, it’s crucial to approach such market movements with a clear strategy and a calm mind. This volatility presents both challenges and potential opportunities for investors. Challenges: Emotional Stress: Seeing your portfolio value decrease can be distressing and might lead to impulsive decisions like panic selling at a loss. Uncertainty: The immediate future of the Bitcoin price becomes less predictable, making investment decisions harder. Liquidity Issues: For those who might need to access funds quickly, a sudden drop could mean selling at an unfavorable price. Opportunities: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): For long-term investors, a dip in Bitcoin price can be an opportunity to buy more at a lower cost, reducing the average purchase price over time.

2025-07-20 23:25:28+00:00,Pension Fund Bitcoin: Ohio’s Monumental Leap into Digital Assets,"BitcoinWorld Pension Fund Bitcoin: Ohio’s Monumental Leap into Digital Assets The financial world is buzzing with news that could signal a monumental shift in how large institutions view digital assets. If you’ve been following the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, you’re likely aware of the growing interest from corporations and high-net-worth individuals. But what happens when one of the nation’s largest public pension funds makes a significant move into the crypto space? The Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS), a financial behemoth managing the retirement savings for hundreds of thousands of Ohio’s public servants, has just done exactly that, increasing its pension fund Bitcoin exposure through a strategic investment. This isn’t just a minor allocation; it’s a clear signal that even the most conservative investment vehicles are beginning to recognize the potential of Bitcoin and the broader digital asset ecosystem. Ohio’s Pension Fund Bitcoin Bet: What Exactly Happened? In a move that has captured headlines across the financial sector, the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System (OPERS) significantly bolstered its stake in a prominent Bitcoin investment firm during the second quarter. This isn’t a small fund; OPERS stands as the largest public pension fund in Ohio and ranks as the 11th-largest in the entire United States, overseeing a vast portfolio. According to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which was also cited by Barron’s, OPERS acquired an additional 21,499 shares in “Strategy,” widely understood to be MicroStrategy (MSTR), a publicly traded company known for its substantial corporate Bitcoin holdings and its strategy of acquiring more Bitcoin over time. This latest purchase brings OPERS’ total stake in MicroStrategy to an impressive 101,880 shares. This increased allocation highlights a growing comfort level among large institutional investors with indirect exposure to Bitcoin, even as direct investment options for pension funds remain complex. Why Are Pension Funds Looking at Bitcoin? The decision by OPERS to deepen its pension fund Bitcoin exposure through MicroStrategy raises an important question: what’s driving this trend among traditionally conservative entities? Pension funds, by their very nature, prioritize long-term stability and consistent returns to meet their future liabilities. For years, digital assets like Bitcoin were largely considered too volatile or speculative for such portfolios. However, several factors are now shifting this perspective: Inflation Hedge: With global inflation concerns on the rise, many investors are seeking assets that can preserve purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed by some as a potential hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Diversification Benefits: Traditional portfolios often rely on a mix of stocks, bonds, and real estate. Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional asset classes, particularly during certain market cycles, can offer valuable diversification benefits, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk while enhancing returns. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated unparalleled growth over the past decade. Institutional investors, with their long-term horizons, may be looking to capture a portion of this potential future appreciation as digital assets mature and gain wider adoption. Accessibility through Public Companies: Investing in companies like MicroStrategy provides an indirect, regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This method offers a level of familiarity and oversight that aligns more closely with pension fund investment mandates. The Growing Trend: Institutional Adoption of Digital Assets OPERS’ move is not an isolated incident but rather a significant piece of a larger puzzle: the accelerating institutional adoption of digital assets. While the journey has been gradual, a clear trend is emerging where more and more sophisticated investors, including endowments, family offices, and now public pension funds, are exploring or actively investing in the crypto space. This shift is being driven by several key developments: Improved Regulatory Clarity: Although still evolving, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is slowly becoming clearer in various jurisdictions, making institutional participation less ambiguous. Enhanced Custodial Solutions: The availability of secure, institutional-grade custody solutions for digital assets has addressed one of the primary concerns for large funds – the safe storage of these novel assets. Increased Market Infrastructure: The growth of regulated exchanges, futures markets, and other financial products built around cryptocurrencies provides more robust and familiar avenues for institutional engagement.

This was the main takeaway from a survey of 1,500 adults conducted in April and commissioned by the Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) . Japanese Crypto Tax Reforms Would Drive Volumes Up, Says JBA In response to the question: “Do you own BTC or other cryptoassets?” 13% of respondents responded in the affirmative. Japan Blockchain Association (JBA) executives speak about their petition for tax reform at the headquarters of the crypto exchange bitFlyer on July 18, 2025. (Source: TV Tokyo Biz/YouTube/Screenshot) However, their response to the follow-up question was telling. The question was: “Would you buy crypto/more crypto if the government were to set a flat 20% tax rate on crypto profits?” To this, 84% of the 191 respondents who said they hold crypto answered “yes.” And 12% of the 1,309 non-crypto holders also agreed that they would start buying coins if Tokyo green-lights tax reforms. Japanese government bonds rallied Friday, with yields dropping across maturities, ahead of Sunday’s closely-watched upper house election https://t.co/IimFxyWeMt — Bloomberg (@business) July 18, 2025 Capital Gains Tax Request The JBA suggested that the survey shows that tax reforms would have a very noticeable effect on the trading volumes of domestic exchanges. At present, Japanese investors must declare their crypto-related profits on income tax returns, in the “other income” category. That means that depending on their tax brackets, crypto investors may have to pay taxes of up to 55% on their profits. In many other nations, crypto is instead subject to capital gains tax. That means that, after a certain threshold, traders are taxed at a flat rate of (typically) 10-20%. The Japanese Cabinet headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. (Source: Mytho88 [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Reform advocates want Tokyo to approve a plan to scrap crypto income tax laws. In their place, they want a flat 20% capital gains levy. The JBA supports this proposal, as do many key members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in addition to opposition lawmakers. However, the regulatory Financial Services Agency (FSA) effectively has the final say on all Japanese crypto policy. Thus far, all of the FSA recommendations to the Cabinet have been enshrined into law. The association said: “Cryptoassets are changing from a means of payment for the public to a means of asset accumulation.” This is in line with the FSA’s own plans to reclassify crypto as a payment tool to an investment vehicle. The industry body says it is “stepping up its efforts” to convince Tokyo to approve tax reform starting next year. The JBA is an industry group that comprises some of the nation’s biggest crypto exchanges and blockchain firms. JBA Submits Petition The association also announced on July 18 that it has submitted a petition to the FSA calling for it to approve tax reform for crypto profits. The survey was conducted on April 24 and April 25 this year. Respondents were all Japanese residents aged 20 to 69. Respondents were 60% male and 40% female, with an average age of 38. The JBA also asked further questions. And 75% of respondents said they would prefer tax bodies to withdraw their payable taxes at source, rather than make separate tax declarations. The JBA has also asked Tokyo to let crypto traders choose how they want to pay taxes: at source when they sell coins, or after filing declarations. The survey’s authors also asked the respondents who do not currently hold any coins why they have not invested yet. To this, 8% of respondents said that they thought that tax levels were too high. But 61% said they thought they lacked sufficient understanding of crypto. The Japanese media outlet CoinPost reported that the FSA is now “deliberating a proposal to transition cryptoassets to the framework of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.” “If the transition is approved, cryptoassets will be officially classified as financial products,” the media outlet explained. Most of the respondents said they work in the private sector. Students made up 5.3% of the respondent pool. And 213 unemployed individuals also submitted responses.

2025-07-21 00:25:19+00:00,Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment Shifts,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment Shifts The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic realm, often driven by a fascinating blend of innovation, speculation, and perhaps most profoundly, human emotion. For anyone looking to gauge the collective mood of crypto investors, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands out as an indispensable tool. Recently, this barometer of market sentiment experienced a slight shift, falling to 71 as of July 21st. While this represents a one-point dip from the previous day, it crucially keeps the index firmly within the “Greed” zone. What does this subtle movement signify for the broader crypto landscape, and how can understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index empower your investment decisions? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by the software development platform Alternative, is designed to distill the complex emotional currents of the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Ranging from 0 to 100, this index offers a quick snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly fearful (closer to 0) or excessively greedy (closer to 100). Think of it as a temperature gauge for investor psychology. When the market is gripped by extreme fear, it often presents potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to act. Conversely, when extreme greed prevails, it can signal that the market is due for a correction, as assets may be overvalued due to irrational exuberance. Understanding this ebb and flow of sentiment, captured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , is vital for both seasoned traders and new entrants. Diving Deeper: How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Work? The beauty of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach. It doesn’t rely on just one metric but synthesizes data from six different sources, each weighted to contribute to the final score. This comprehensive methodology aims to provide a holistic view of market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the components: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility, especially on the downside, often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum. High buying volume in a rising market can indicate greed, while low volume or selling pressure might suggest fear. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency. A surge in positive, enthusiastic posts might signal greed, while negative sentiment can indicate fear. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component traditionally gathered opinions from thousands of crypto investors through weekly polls. These surveys provided direct insights into investor confidence. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s dominance, or its market cap share compared to the entire crypto market, is another indicator. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear, as investors might be moving away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance might suggest a shift towards altcoin speculation, indicating greed. Google Trends (10%): This component analyzes Google search data for crypto-related terms. A spike in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto scam” might indicate fear, whereas searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” during a bull run could suggest greed. By combining these diverse data points, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a robust, albeit not infallible, gauge of the market’s collective psychological state. Understanding the Current State: Why Did the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Dip to 71? The recent one-point fall of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 71, while keeping it in the “Greed” zone, is a subtle yet important detail. A score of 71 still signifies a strong level of optimism and buying interest in the market. The “Greed” zone typically ranges from 50 to 74, with “Extreme Greed” starting at 75 and going up to 100. This slight dip could be attributed to various factors that influence market sentiment on a daily basis. It might reflect a minor profit-taking event, a temporary cooling of enthusiasm after a rally, or perhaps some macroeconomic news that introduced a whisper of caution. Despite this small reduction, the prevailing sentiment remains positive, suggesting that investors are still largely confident and willing to engage with the market. It’s a reminder that even in a period of general optimism, sentiment can fluctuate, offering brief windows for re-evaluation without necessarily signaling an imminent reversal.

BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling Crucial Market Sentiment Shifts The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic realm, often driven by a fascinating blend of innovation, speculation, and perhaps most profoundly, human emotion. For anyone looking to gauge the collective mood of crypto investors, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index stands out as an indispensable tool. Recently, this barometer of market sentiment experienced a slight shift, falling to 71 as of July 21st. While this represents a one-point dip from the previous day, it crucially keeps the index firmly within the “Greed” zone. What does this subtle movement signify for the broader crypto landscape, and how can understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index empower your investment decisions? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by the software development platform Alternative, is designed to distill the complex emotional currents of the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Ranging from 0 to 100, this index offers a quick snapshot of whether market participants are feeling overly fearful (closer to 0) or excessively greedy (closer to 100). Think of it as a temperature gauge for investor psychology. When the market is gripped by extreme fear, it often presents potential buying opportunities for those brave enough to act. Conversely, when extreme greed prevails, it can signal that the market is due for a correction, as assets may be overvalued due to irrational exuberance. Understanding this ebb and flow of sentiment, captured by the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , is vital for both seasoned traders and new entrants. Diving Deeper: How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Work? The beauty of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach. It doesn’t rely on just one metric but synthesizes data from six different sources, each weighted to contribute to the final score. This comprehensive methodology aims to provide a holistic view of market sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the components: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility, especially on the downside, often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum. High buying volume in a rising market can indicate greed, while low volume or selling pressure might suggest fear. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency. A surge in positive, enthusiastic posts might signal greed, while negative sentiment can indicate fear. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component traditionally gathered opinions from thousands of crypto investors through weekly polls. These surveys provided direct insights into investor confidence. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin’s dominance, or its market cap share compared to the entire crypto market, is another indicator. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear, as investors might be moving away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. A decreasing dominance might suggest a shift towards altcoin speculation, indicating greed. Google Trends (10%): This component analyzes Google search data for crypto-related terms. A spike in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto scam” might indicate fear, whereas searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” during a bull run could suggest greed.

The Altcoin Season Index, a crucial metric for market watchers, recently registered a significant 53 at 00:30 UTC on July 21. This isn’t just a number; it’s a clear signal that the market has officially entered what’s known as Altcoin Season . For anyone involved in digital assets, this period often brings about incredible opportunities and shifts in market dynamics. What Exactly is Altcoin Season and Why Does it Matter? When we talk about Altcoin Season , we’re referring to a specific phase in the crypto market cycle where alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) generally outperform Bitcoin. It’s a time when many investors see substantial gains across a diverse range of digital assets beyond just BTC. The metric that confirms this shift is the Altcoin Season Index, tracked diligently by CoinMarketCap (CMC). Here’s a breakdown of how the index works: The Metric: The index evaluates the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. Exclusions: To ensure accuracy, stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) are excluded from the analysis. This ensures the focus remains on genuine market performance of independent assets. The Rule: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Opposite: Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin, the market is considered to be in ‘Bitcoin Season’, where Bitcoin largely dominates returns. The Scale: The index itself operates on a scale from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. A score of 53, as seen on July 21, firmly places us in Altcoin Season territory. Understanding this index is vital because it provides a clear, data-driven perspective on where capital is flowing within the crypto ecosystem. It helps investors gauge market sentiment and identify potential trends. Understanding the Dynamics: Why Does Altcoin Season Emerge? The transition into Altcoin Season isn’t random; it’s typically a result of a fascinating interplay of market forces and investor psychology. It often follows periods of strong Bitcoin performance. Here’s a look at the key drivers: Bitcoin Dominance Shifts: Bitcoin usually leads market rallies. Once Bitcoin has made significant gains and perhaps consolidated, investors often start looking for higher returns elsewhere. This leads to a rotation of capital from Bitcoin into altcoins. Search for Alpha: As Bitcoin’s market capitalization grows, its percentage gains can become less dramatic compared to smaller, more volatile altcoins. Investors seeking ‘alpha’ – returns above the market benchmark – naturally turn to altcoins with lower market caps and greater growth potential. Innovation and Utility: Many altcoins represent innovative projects with unique technologies, use cases, and growing ecosystems (DeFi, NFTs, Gaming, Layer-2 solutions, etc.). As these projects mature and gain adoption, their native tokens see increased demand. Increased Risk Appetite: During bull markets, overall investor confidence tends to increase. This leads to a higher tolerance for risk, making investors more willing to explore altcoins, which typically carry higher volatility but also higher potential rewards. This dynamic interplay creates a fertile ground for altcoins to flourish, leading to the collective outperformance that defines Altcoin Season . Navigating the Waters: Opportunities and Risks in Altcoin Season While Altcoin Season presents exciting prospects, it’s crucial to approach it with a balanced perspective, acknowledging both its potential and its pitfalls. This period can be a double-edged sword for unprepared investors. The Opportunities: What Can You Gain? Explosive Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially those with smaller market capitalizations, have the potential for parabolic price movements that can far outpace Bitcoin’s gains. Portfolio Diversification: Investing in a variety of altcoins across different sectors (e.g., DeFi, gaming, infrastructure) can help spread risk and capture growth from multiple angles. Discovering Innovation: Altcoin Season often shines a spotlight on cutting-edge projects and technologies that could shape the future of Web3 and beyond. Being an early supporter can yield significant rewards. Community Engagement: Many altcoin projects have vibrant, engaged communities. Participating can offer valuable insights and networking opportunities. The Risks: What Should You Watch Out For? High Volatility: Altcoins are notoriously volatile. While this means potential for large gains, it also means potential for rapid and significant losses. Prices can swing wildly in short periods.

The House of Representatives recently passed three significant bills aimed at regulating digital assets, marking a pivotal moment for the industry. However, these legislative changes are not expected to take effect for quite some time. Three Key Crypto Bills Passed The three bills—the Genius Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act—are seen as crucial steps toward establishing a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This development has been fueled by intense lobbying efforts from industry players like Coinbase Global, which have successfully influenced politicians, including Trump. Related Reading: Bitcoin Re-Enters Profit Zone As Greed Rises, But Rally To $200,000 Still Possible In anticipation of this legislative week, Bitcoin prices soared to record highs beyond the $123,000 mark for the first time, alongside significant gains for other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) and XRP. However, TD Securities analyst Jaret Seiberg notes that it could take over a year for the new legislation to come into effect. Among the passed bills, only the Genius Act has also cleared the Senate, and Trump signed it into law shortly thereafter. This act establishes a framework for regulating payment stablecoins requiring issuers to maintain one-to-one reserves in US dollars or Treasury securities. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has argued that this law could generate an additional $3.7 trillion demand for T-bills, although some analysts, like Raymond James’ Ed Mills, express skepticism about such projections. Implementation Timeline Remains Uncertain Despite the signing of the Genius Act, there will be no immediate impacts on stablecoin issuers such as Circle Internet Group or Tether. As reported by ABC news, the Treasury Department is expected to draft rules within a year detailing the qualifications for issuing stablecoins and the conditions under which foreign-pegged stablecoins can enter the US market. This process will involve public commentary and could lead to litigation, suggesting a lengthy timeline before any real changes are felt in the industry. Related Reading: Warning Signs Flash As Bitcoin Miners Unload At Record Pace The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, on the other hand, is particularly important as it delineates the regulatory oversight of crypto exchanges, brokers, and tokens between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

2025-07-21 01:40:26+00:00,Bitcoin Whale Unveils Massive $92 Million Profit with Binance Deposit,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Unveils Massive $92 Million Profit with Binance Deposit In the ever-unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, the actions of large holders, often dubbed ‘whales,’ can send ripples across the entire market. Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with news of a significant move by an anonymous Bitcoin whale , whose latest transaction has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. This massive transfer not only highlights the immense profits achievable in the digital asset space but also raises crucial questions about potential market dynamics and investor strategies. What Just Happened? Decoding the Bitcoin Whale’s Move On-chain analysis, a powerful tool for peering into the blockchain’s transparent ledger, recently brought a fascinating development to light. As reported by prominent on-chain analyst @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), an anonymous Bitcoin whale has initiated a substantial profit-taking maneuver. This particular whale had been meticulously accumulating 1,500 BTC over a period spanning 2023 and 2024, acquiring these digital assets at an impressive average price of $56,418 per Bitcoin. The recent activity saw this enigmatic investor transfer a staggering 400 BTC, valued at approximately $47.11 million at the time of the transaction, directly to the Binance Exchange. Such a large deposit into a centralized exchange is often interpreted as a precursor to selling activity, as exchanges are the primary venues for converting cryptocurrency into fiat currency or other digital assets. This move by the Bitcoin whale underscores a strategic decision to realize gains after a period of significant market appreciation. The Transaction: 400 BTC (valued at ~$47.11 million) transferred to Binance. The Accumulation: 1,500 BTC acquired between 2023-2024 at an average price of $56,418. The Timing: Within the past six hours of the report, indicating a swift decision to capitalize on current market prices. The Astounding Profits: How This Bitcoin Whale Struck Gold The sheer scale of the profits generated by this Bitcoin whale is nothing short of remarkable, serving as a testament to the potential returns in the volatile yet rewarding cryptocurrency market. By patiently accumulating Bitcoin at an average price of $56,418 and now selling a portion at significantly higher levels, the whale has managed to secure an estimated $92 million in profit from this single tranche of the transaction. To put this into perspective, let’s consider the breakdown of their holdings and realized gains: Metric Details Total BTC Accumulated 1,500 BTC Average Acquisition Price $56,418 per BTC BTC Transferred to Binance 400 BTC Value of Transferred BTC (at time of report) ~$47.11 million Estimated Profit from 400 BTC Sale ~$92 million Remaining BTC Holdings 1,100 BTC Value of Remaining BTC Holdings (at time of report) ~$128 million This strategic profit-taking allows the Bitcoin whale to de-risk a portion of their portfolio while still maintaining a substantial exposure to Bitcoin’s future price movements. The remaining 1,100 BTC, currently valued at approximately $128 million, signifies continued confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects, even as they secure a significant portion of their accumulated gains. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale’s Action Matter to You? For many investors, especially those new to the crypto space, the movements of a single large entity might seem distant. However, the actions of a prominent Bitcoin whale can have tangible ripple effects across the broader market. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed investment decisions and anticipating potential market shifts. Here’s why this particular event holds significance: Market Sentiment Indicator: When a whale deposits a large amount of BTC to an exchange, it often signals an intent to sell. This can create a perception of increased selling pressure, potentially leading to a dip in prices as other investors react. It can also be seen as a sign that even large holders believe current prices are attractive for profit-taking. Liquidity Impact: A sudden influx of a large volume of Bitcoin onto exchanges can temporarily increase market supply, which, if not met by equivalent demand, could lead to price corrections. While the crypto market has grown significantly, such large transfers are still noteworthy. On-Chain Transparency: This event highlights the power of on-chain analytics. Unlike traditional finance, where large institutional moves might remain opaque, the blockchain’s transparency allows analysts to track and report such significant transfers, providing valuable insights into market participants’ behavior. This information empowers smaller investors to make more data-driven decisions, even if they cannot predict exact price movements. It’s important to remember that while a whale’s actions can influence the market, they are not the sole determinant of price.

By patiently accumulating Bitcoin at an average price of $56,418 and now selling a portion at significantly higher levels, the whale has managed to secure an estimated $92 million in profit from this single tranche of the transaction. To put this into perspective, let’s consider the breakdown of their holdings and realized gains: Metric Details Total BTC Accumulated 1,500 BTC Average Acquisition Price $56,418 per BTC BTC Transferred to Binance 400 BTC Value of Transferred BTC (at time of report) ~$47.11 million Estimated Profit from 400 BTC Sale ~$92 million Remaining BTC Holdings 1,100 BTC Value of Remaining BTC Holdings (at time of report) ~$128 million This strategic profit-taking allows the Bitcoin whale to de-risk a portion of their portfolio while still maintaining a substantial exposure to Bitcoin’s future price movements. The remaining 1,100 BTC, currently valued at approximately $128 million, signifies continued confidence in the asset’s long-term prospects, even as they secure a significant portion of their accumulated gains. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale’s Action Matter to You? For many investors, especially those new to the crypto space, the movements of a single large entity might seem distant. However, the actions of a prominent Bitcoin whale can have tangible ripple effects across the broader market. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for making informed investment decisions and anticipating potential market shifts. Here’s why this particular event holds significance: Market Sentiment Indicator: When a whale deposits a large amount of BTC to an exchange, it often signals an intent to sell. This can create a perception of increased selling pressure, potentially leading to a dip in prices as other investors react. It can also be seen as a sign that even large holders believe current prices are attractive for profit-taking. Liquidity Impact: A sudden influx of a large volume of Bitcoin onto exchanges can temporarily increase market supply, which, if not met by equivalent demand, could lead to price corrections. While the crypto market has grown significantly, such large transfers are still noteworthy. On-Chain Transparency: This event highlights the power of on-chain analytics. Unlike traditional finance, where large institutional moves might remain opaque, the blockchain’s transparency allows analysts to track and report such significant transfers, providing valuable insights into market participants’ behavior. This information empowers smaller investors to make more data-driven decisions, even if they cannot predict exact price movements. It’s important to remember that while a whale’s actions can influence the market, they are not the sole determinant of price. Broader macroeconomic factors, regulatory new"

According to data from onchain sleuth ZachXBT, the attacker withdrew assets worth ~$44.2 million. The expert noted that the exchange''s team did not report the attack for about 17 hours. CoinDCX co-founder Sumit Gupta responded to ZachXBT''s Telegram post a few minutes later, confirming the incident. According to him, as a result of a ”sophisticated attack” on the server, the hacker compromised the platform''s internal operating account, which is used exclusively for providing liquidity on the partner exchange. The entrepreneur did not announce the amount of the damage. ”I confirm that CoinDCX wallets storing customer assets were unaffected and remain completely safe,” Gupta said. He emphasized that the team quickly localized the hack, which was limited to a single account. All platform losses are covered by treasury funds. The incident did not affect the exchange''s normal operations, including trading, deposits, and withdrawals. CoinDCX has enlisted cybersecurity experts to investigate the incident and is working with its partner exchange to track the stolen funds to block and recover them, Gupta added. Experts noted that the attack on CoinDCX came exactly a year after India''s WazirX exchange was hacked for ~$235 million. In April 2025, the platform announced a resumption of operations, but at the time of writing this has not happened.

The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with exhilarating news! Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, has just achieved a monumental feat, soaring past the $118,000 mark . This impressive surge, meticulously noted by Bitcoin World market monitoring, sees BTC trading at a remarkable $118,006.21 on the Binance USDT market, sending ripples of excitement and speculation across the globe. For long-time enthusiasts and new entrants alike, this latest milestone in Bitcoin price is more than just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the asset’s enduring resilience, growing influence, and its potential to redefine financial landscapes. Let’s dive deep into what this significant movement means and what factors are propelling Bitcoin to new heights. What’s Driving the Latest Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the forces behind such a significant rally is crucial for any crypto enthusiast. The recent surge in Bitcoin price to over $118,000 isn’t a random event; it’s the culmination of several powerful macroeconomic and market-specific catalysts. These drivers create a compelling narrative for Bitcoin’s continued ascent: Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows: A major catalyst has been the increasing embrace of Bitcoin by traditional financial institutions. The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for significant capital inflows from institutional investors, wealth managers, and even retail investors who prefer regulated investment vehicles. This influx of ‘smart money’ provides a robust foundation for the rising Bitcoin price . Macroeconomic Headwinds: In an era marked by inflation concerns and geopolitical uncertainties, investors are increasingly seeking safe-haven assets and inflation hedges. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ has emerged as a preferred alternative to traditional stores of value. Its decentralized nature and finite supply make it an attractive asset during periods of economic volatility, pushing demand and consequently the Bitcoin price upwards. Halving Event Anticipation: While not immediate, the anticipation of Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving event plays a psychological role. Halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoins entering the market, historically leading to significant price appreciation in the months following the event. Even in anticipation, this supply shock narrative contributes to bullish sentiment and upward pressure on the Bitcoin price . Growing Retail Interest and Awareness: Beyond institutional players, there’s a resurgence in retail interest. Increased media coverage, greater accessibility through user-friendly platforms, and positive price action itself often attract new individual investors. This broader participation adds liquidity and momentum to the market, further supporting the Bitcoin price . Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as advancements in the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, or innovations like Ordinals, enhance Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. These improvements reinforce its long-term viability and contribute to investor confidence, indirectly influencing the Bitcoin price . Analyzing the Bitcoin Price Action: Key Levels and Trends Observing the journey of Bitcoin price to this impressive level reveals a pattern of resilience and breaking through significant resistance points. Market analysts closely monitor key psychological and technical levels to gauge momentum and potential future movements. The $118,000 mark is not just a number; it represents a new frontier, surpassing previous all-time highs and setting new benchmarks for the digital asset. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated a remarkable ability to recover from significant corrections, often reaching new peaks. This ‘volatility followed by new highs’ pattern is a defining characteristic of its market cycle. The current surge suggests strong buying pressure and a conviction among investors that Bitcoin’s fundamental value continues to grow. Let’s consider a hypothetical progression of the Bitcoin price leading up to this milestone: Date Key Price Level (Approx.) Market Commentary Early Q4 $85,000 Consolidation after a period of steady growth; strong support found. Mid Q4 $95,000 Breakout from consolidation; increased institutional interest noted. Late Q4 $105,000 Significant psychological barrier overcome; bullish sentiment intensifies. Present $118,006.21 New all-time high achieved; strong momentum observed on Binance USDT. This upward trajectory highlights the market’s positive response to the aforementioned catalysts.

2025-07-21 02:41:50+00:00,"BTC at $121K, ETH at $3K, ADA at $0.71, still, one $0.03 token may outperform all","The cryptocurrency market continues to dazzle with Bitcoin (BTC) soaring beyond the $121,000 mark, Ethereum (ETH) holding steady at $3,000, and Cardano (ADA) reaching $0.71. Despite these impressive milestones, prudent investors are turning their attention to a token priced at just $0.03 that is poised to deliver outsized returns in the near future. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly gaining momentum and stands out as a compelling opportunity for both seasoned traders and new entrants seeking exceptional growth in DeFi. While BTC, ETH, and ADA dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly advances with a solid presale foundation. Over $12.6 million has been raised, with 80% of the total 4 billion token supply sold during Phase 5. More than 13,600 holders have already committed to MUTM, signaling growing confidence in the project’s vision. The current presale price of $0.03 will soon increase to $0.035 in the next phase, marking a strategic entry point before a significant price run. Cutting-edge lending models and layer-2 innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch two distinct lending models aimed at addressing the diverse needs of crypto investors: P2C (Pool-to-Contract) lending and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) borrowing. In the proposed P2C model, a user lending $15,000 worth of BTC-backed assets at a 65% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could potentially earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of around 12%. Upon depositing, users would receive 15,000mtBTC tokens in 1:1 that reflect their holdings and are designed to increase in value as interest accumulates. This mechanism is intended to offer passive income and liquidity without requiring constant oversight or manual reinvestment. Meanwhile, the planned P2P borrowing model is expected to provide greater flexibility through direct, customizable loan agreements. In this scenario, a borrower might use 2 PEPE tokens as collateral to access $1,200 in USDT at a 70% LTV, with repayment terms negotiated individually. This direct, peer-driven approach is being developed to accommodate users seeking more tailored lending experiences than traditional DeFi platforms typically allow. A foundational aspect of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s future roadmap is its integration with Layer-2 blockchain technology. This strategic move is expected to significantly reduce gas fees and transaction times—two persistent challenges in DeFi. By delivering faster, more affordable transactions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to lower the barrier to entry for a wider audience and improve the overall usability of its protocol. Security, roadmap, and community incentives fuel growth The platform will undergo rigorous audits during its upcoming roadmap phases, including manual reviews and advanced automated analysis. CertiK, a trusted leader in blockchain security, has already provided Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with impressive audit results, including a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50. These scores reflect strong code integrity and secure smart contract architecture, reassuring investors that their funds will be protected. The project is gearing up for its Beta launch, which will open the platform to early testers, allowing the community to explore features and provide critical feedback. This phase will showcase the robustness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts, front-end and back-end developments, and risk management tools. As this Beta testing phase unfolds, user confidence will grow, setting the stage for a successful mainnet release. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also actively rewarding its growing community. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway , which will reward ten lucky winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, serves to expand the user base while building engagement. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivises security researchers worldwide to contribute to the platform’s resilience, ensuring that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stays ahead of potential vulnerabilities. As the next presale phase approaches, the opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at $0.03 dwindles rapidly. The impending 20% price increase to $0.035 will likely accelerate demand, especially from whales currently reallocating assets from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These large investors recognise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an undervalued DeFi token with a roadmap, technology, and community that position it for explosive growth. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios beyond established giants like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a high-conviction opportunity. With a revolutionary lending system, advanced Layer-2 integration, solid security audits, and strong incentives for early supporters, MUTM is on track to outperform the big three within just 60 days of wider market exposure. The time to act is now. The combination of a low current price, nearly sold-out presale, and upcoming milestones makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a rare chance to joi",invezz,https://invezz.com/news/2025/07/21/btc-at-121k-eth-at-3k-ada-at-0-71-still-one-0-03-token-may-outperform-all/,BTC|ETH|ADA|BUSINESS|TRADING,Crypto|Sponsored,BTC,"BTC at $121K, ETH at $3K, ADA at $0.71, still, one $0.03 token may outperform all.

While BTC, ETH, and ADA dominate headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) quietly advances with a solid presale foundation. Over $12.6 million has been raised, with 80% of the total 4 billion token supply sold during Phase 5. More than 13,600 holders have already committed to MUTM, signaling growing confidence in the project’s vision. The current presale price of $0.03 will soon increase to $0.035 in the next phase, marking a strategic entry point before a significant price run. Cutting-edge lending models and layer-2 innovation Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to launch two distinct lending models aimed at addressing the diverse needs of crypto investors: P2C (Pool-to-Contract) lending and P2P (Peer-to-Peer) borrowing. In the proposed P2C model, a user lending $15,000 worth of BTC-backed assets at a 65% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could potentially earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of around 12%. Upon depositing, users would receive 15,000mtBTC tokens in 1:1 that reflect their holdings and are designed to increase in value as interest accumulates. This mechanism is intended to offer passive income and liquidity without requiring constant oversight or manual reinvestment. Meanwhile, the planned P2P borrowing model is expected to provide greater flexibility through direct, customizable loan agreements. In this scenario, a borrower might use 2 PEPE tokens as collateral to access $1,200 in USDT at a 70% LTV, with repayment terms negotiated individually. This direct, peer-driven approach is being developed to accommodate users seeking more tailored lending experiences than traditional DeFi platforms typically allow. A foundational aspect of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s future roadmap is its integration with Layer-2 blockchain technology. This strategic move is expected to significantly reduce gas fees and transaction times—two persistent challenges in DeFi. By delivering faster, more affordable transactions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to lower the barrier to entry for a wider audience and improve the overall usability of its protocol. Security, roadmap, and community incentives fuel growth The platform will undergo rigorous audits during its upcoming roadmap phases, including manual reviews and advanced automated analysis. CertiK, a trusted leader in blockchain security, has already provided Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with impressive audit results, including a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50. These scores reflect strong code integrity and secure smart contract architecture, reassuring investors that their funds will be protected. The project is gearing up for its Beta launch, which will open the platform to early testers, allowing the community to explore features and provide critical feedback. This phase will showcase the robustness of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts, front-end and back-end developments, and risk management tools. As this Beta testing phase unfolds, user confidence will grow, setting the stage for a successful mainnet release. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also actively rewarding its growing community. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway , which will reward ten lucky winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each, serves to expand the user base while building engagement. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty program incentivises security researchers worldwide to contribute to the platform’s resilience, ensuring that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stays ahead of potential vulnerabilities. As the next presale phase approaches, the opportunity to purchase MUTM tokens at $0.03 dwindles rapidly. The impending 20% price increase to $0.035 will likely accelerate demand, especially from whales currently reallocating assets from Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). These large investors recognise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as an undervalued DeFi token with a roadmap, technology, and community that position it for explosive growth. For investors looking to diversify their portfolios beyond established giants like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA), Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a high-conviction opportunity. With a revolutionary lending system, advanced Layer-2 integration, solid security audits, and strong incentives for early supporters, MUTM is on track to outperform the big three within just 60 days of wider market exposure. The time to act is now. The combination of a low current price, nearly sold-out presale, and upcoming milestones makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a rare chance to joi"

For those navigating the derivatives market, understanding the mechanics of crypto perpetual futures liquidation is not just important; it’s essential for survival. In the last 24 hours, the market witnessed significant liquidation events across major digital assets, painting a vivid picture of prevailing market sentiment and trader positioning. Let’s dive deep into what these figures mean for you and the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before we dissect the numbers, let’s clarify what crypto perpetual futures liquidation entails. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without an expiry date, mimicking spot market trading with leverage. This leverage, while amplifying potential gains, also magnifies losses. Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, leading the exchange to automatically close their leveraged position to prevent further losses. It’s a critical mechanism designed to protect both the exchange and the solvency of the market. Leverage Amplifies: While leverage can magnify potential gains, it equally magnifies potential losses, making risk management paramount. Margin Call Trigger: Liquidation is triggered when a trader’s margin balance on a leveraged position drops below the minimum maintenance level required by the exchange. Automatic Closure: The exchange automatically closes the position to prevent the trader’s account from falling into negative equity and to maintain market stability. Market Protection: This mechanism helps protect both individual traders from excessive debt and the overall market from systemic risk due to highly leveraged, failing positions. The Shocking 24-Hour Breakdown: Who Got Hit Hardest by Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? The past 24 hours have been particularly telling, with substantial amounts of capital wiped out due to crypto perpetual futures liquidation . This data provides a snapshot of where the market’s vulnerabilities lie and which positions were most aggressively pursued, only to be unwound. Let’s look at the raw numbers: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidation (USD) Dominant Position Liquidated Bitcoin (BTC) $41.50 million Long (58.09%) Ethereum (ETH) $150.27 million Short (65.73%) Dogecoin (DOGE) $19.94 million Long (50.44%) Deep Dive: What Do These Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Numbers Tell Us? Bitcoin (BTC): Longs Wiped Out With $41.50 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidation , Bitcoin saw a majority of long positions (58.09%) liquidated. This suggests that during the 24-hour period, BTC experienced a price drop, catching bullish traders off guard. Long positions profit from price increases, so a significant liquidation of longs indicates downward price pressure. This often happens during sudden market dips or corrections, forcing traders who bet on higher prices to exit their positions at a loss. It’s a classic example of how swift market movements can punish overleveraged bullish bets. Ethereum (ETH): A Short Squeeze in Reverse? Ethereum stood out with a staggering $150.27 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidation , predominantly from short positions (65.73%). This is a crucial insight: a high liquidation of short positions typically occurs when the asset’s price unexpectedly rises, forcing bearish traders to cover their positions. This suggests a significant upward price movement for ETH during the period, challenging the bearish sentiment that had accumulated. Such events can trigger cascade effects, as forced short closures can further fuel price increases, creating what’s known as a ‘short squeeze’ that catches bears off guard. Dogecoin (DOGE): Meme Coin Volatility Strikes Longs Dogecoin, true to its volatile nature, saw $19.94 million in crypto perpetual futures liquidation , with long positions accounting for 50.44%. Similar to Bitcoin, this indicates a price decline that hit traders betting on DOGE’s upward momentum. Meme coins like DOGE are particularly susceptible to rapid price swings due to their community-driven nature and speculative appeal. These liquidation figures underscore the heightened risk associated with leveraged trading on such assets, where even minor market shifts can have outsized impacts on positions. The Ripple Effect: Why Does Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Matter to the Market?

2025-07-21 03:03:47+00:00,Why Bitcoin Is Missing Out on Today’s Crypto Rally,"The post Why Bitcoin Is Missing Out on Today’s Crypto Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News While Bitcoin remains stuck below a key resistance level, much of the crypto market, especially altcoins like Ethereum and XRP, is showing strong bullish signs. So, why is the broader crypto market pumping while Bitcoin is cooling off? The answer lies in Bitcoin dominance, which is seeing a sharp drop. Bitcoin dominance refers to how much of the total crypto market value is held in Bitcoin. When this dominance falls, it usually means that investors are moving money from Bitcoin into altcoins. This shift is a sign that “altcoin season” has begun, where assets like Ethereum, Solana, and XRP often outperform Bitcoin. In fact, Ethereum has surged by nearly 3.75% recently, even as Bitcoin’s share of the market dropped by about 0.62%. The total value of the altcoin market is still below its all-time high, which shows there’s space for further growth. Also, the total crypto market cap, excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum, is showing a bullish pattern similar to what the market saw in 2017 before altcoins exploded in price. What About Bitcoin? Still Bullish, But Facing Short-Term Resistance In every past cycle, Bitcoin is usually the first to move. Once it makes a strong rally, the next big move comes from Ethereum. After that, large altcoins begin to rise, followed by smaller and newer altcoins. This pattern has repeated itself over the years, and so far, the current market seems to be following the same path. However, Bitcoin’s overall long-term trend remains bullish , with a cup-and-handle pattern hinting at a move toward $153,000. However, in the short term, it’s facing tough resistance between $120,000 and $123,000. Until BTC breaks above that zone, it may continue trading sideways. Short-term indicators like the RSI (Relative Strength Index) show that Bitcoin has cooled down from its overbought levels, which means there’s room for a fresh move up. But before that happens, Bitcoin might dip slightly to around $116,700, where there’s a lot of market liquidity, before possibly heading higher again.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-bitcoin-is-missing-out-on-todays-crypto-rally/,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|ALTCOIN|ETH,News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,BTC,"Why Bitcoin Is Missing Out on Today’s Crypto Rally.

2025-07-21 03:22:56+00:00,XRP Price Prediction For July 21,"The post XRP Price Prediction For July 21 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is currently showing strong bullish signs, especially on the weekly chart. While there is a bearish divergence forming, it hasn’t been confirmed yet and for now, the overall trend for XRP remains bullish, and the price structure still supports a breakout outlook. XRP is known for its sharp, fast price movements. Right now, it seems to be in the middle of a move to the upside, just like the previous volatile cycles. The recent breakout above the important $3 resistance level is a strong signal that the asset could be heading toward new all-time highs. If the trend continues, the next big price target lies between $4.60 and $4.70, based on the 2.618 Fibonacci extension level. However, if XRP does pull back, there’s strong support at the $3 level and even stronger short-term support between $3.30 and $3.40, an area that previously acted as resistance but is now turning into a solid base after the recent breakout and retest. On the daily chart, XRP has already confirmed this new support zone after bouncing off it recently. This is a positive shift that shows bulls are still in control. The altcoin’s strength is also supported by the declining Bitcoin dominance in the market. As Bitcoin loses some ground in terms of market share, capital is flowing into altcoins like XRP and Ethereum, giving them room to grow and outperform. Conclusion: Right now, XRP’s price is moving just as expected in a bullish pattern. It recently broke above $3.40 and is now consolidating, or stabilizing, just above that line. As long as it stays above this level, the trend looks strong. However, there are important support levels to watch. If XRP falls below $2.75, the overall uptrend could break down, which would be a warning sign.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-july-21/,TRADING|XRP|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET,News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),BTC,"XRP Price Prediction For July 21.

Despite pro-crypto legislation and industry buzz, Coinbase''s fundamentals and revenue growth have lagged, failing to surpass previous cycle highs. COIN''s market cap now exceeds established exchanges like CME and ICE, which is unjustified given its limited economic utility compared to those platforms. I recommend selling or avoiding COIN at current levels; the risk/reward is unfavorable at these prices. I was a very vocal bull on Coinbase(COIN) during the crypto winter in 2022 (link here ) when it had a market cap of $15 billion and crypto exchanges/products were dropping like flies(link here ). I argued that at those valuations, COIN had a very good chance of doing well, due to its strong creditworthiness. COIN was trading at ~$60/share then and is $419/share now. But at its current market cap and with all this market buzz about pro-crypto legislation, I think the risks outweigh the value and potential. COIN stock price (stockcharts) 1.COIN operates in a very competitive market COIN operates in a very competitive market with existing competitors such as Binance. There’s not much inherent advantage you get from trading on COIN that you can’t get from trading at say IBKR or BTC ETFs. By one measure (per below chart , COIN’s market share was 6% in July 2025, virtually unchanged compared to 2022). Crypto trading market share is difficult to measure (and by some measurements, COIN’s market share is much higher), but the financial figures in the sections below seems to suggest that COIN probably hasn’t made much progress in terms of market share. Coinbase market share (The Block) The recent passage of the GENIUS Act , while ostensibly favorable for the crypto industry, does not have a clear mechanism to benefit COIN. Unlike 5 years ago when mainstream financial institutions were less flattering in their view of crypto, nowadays many mainstream financial institutions are seriously trying to figure out how to capitalize on this market segment. Even if there is major growth from stablecoins, there will likely be lots of competing options and JPM and Blackrock can probably offer as compelling (if not even more compelling) product given their size and stature. With the huge success of Bitcoin ETFs in terms of capital attracted , this will likely attract more competition from mainstream financial institutions. 2.COIN has market cap on par or even higher than many traditional exchanges. Market cap at July 18 2025 (CME ) $99bn ( ICE ) $103bn ( COIN ) $107bn When I made the above comparison in 2022, COIN had a market cap that was a fraction of traditional exchanges such as CME and ICE. Now COIN’s market cap surpasses that of CME and ICE. If we take a step back, does that really make sense from an economic perspective? Is the value of a crypto exchange going to exceed that of exchanges that trade hundreds of products from oil to food that we need on a day to day basis? Or to put it another way, people and companies will be buying and selling futures on CME or ICE to hedge their exposure to foods, metals etc and they’re probably happy to let CME and ICE take a small cut out of that, in order to conduct this activity on a well-established exchange. Whereas crypto traders are mainly trading back and forth the existing pile of Bitcoin etc, while there is some value in this, I can’t see in the long run, how such a crypto exchange would be able to extract more value out of this activity, than exchanges such as CME and ICE that can out of hundreds of commodities and derivatives. While crypto may have its uses, you can’t eat Bitcoin, or make cars out of it etc - CME and ICE are essentially “taxing” or taking a small cut out of trillions of dollars of recurring economic activity whereas COIN is making money off people largely trading a few types of securities. I just don’t see COIN as being proportional to CME and ICE in the long run. 3.COIN fundamentals have not shown much growth While COIN revenues have grown substantially since my bullish piece in 2022, overall the growth has been rather slower than I anticipated: Revenues have only grown to $6.7 bn on a TTM basis , compared to $3 billion in 2022 and have not even exceeded the previous cycle’s highs (2021 revenues of $7.8bn. Profitability is also nowhere near previous cycle’s highs either, TTM net income is $1.5bn possibly impact by one-off items as 2024 net income was $2.5bn, but in any case, still lower than 2021 net income of $3.1 bn. I think this further shows how competitive the crypto landscape is, despite favorable policy environment and strong creditworthiness, COIN has not been able to capitalize on the trend and achieve meaningful growth in the past few years.

Or to put it another way, people and companies will be buying and selling futures on CME or ICE to hedge their exposure to foods, metals etc and they’re probably happy to let CME and ICE take a small cut out of that, in order to conduct this activity on a well-established exchange. Whereas crypto traders are mainly trading back and forth the existing pile of Bitcoin etc, while there is some value in this, I can’t see in the long run, how such a crypto exchange would be able to extract more value out of this activity, than exchanges such as CME and ICE that can out of hundreds of commodities and derivatives. While crypto may have its uses, you can’t eat Bitcoin, or make cars out of it etc - CME and ICE are essentially “taxing” or taking a small cut out of trillions of dollars of recurring economic activity whereas COIN is making money off people largely trading a few types of securities. I just don’t see COIN as being proportional to CME and ICE in the long run. 3.COIN fundamentals have not shown much growth While COIN revenues have grown substantially since my bullish piece in 2022, overall the growth has been rather slower than I anticipated: Revenues have only grown to $6.7 bn on a TTM basis , compared to $3 billion in 2022 and have not even exceeded the previous cycle’s highs (2021 revenues of $7.8bn. Profitability is also nowhere near previous cycle’s highs either, TTM net income is $1.5bn possibly impact by one-off items as 2024 net income was $2.5bn, but in any case, still lower than 2021 net income of $3.1 bn. I think this further shows how competitive the crypto landscape is, despite favorable policy environment and strong creditworthiness, COIN has not been able to capitalize on the trend and achieve meaningful growth in the past few years. Risks to bearish thesis With the passage of pro-crypto legislation, perhaps COIN can capitalize on this wave of interest and achieve further growth to su"

Imagine a floodgate opening for institutional money into the Ethereum ecosystem. That’s precisely what we’ve witnessed with U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs , which have just recorded their most significant weekly net inflows since their inception. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a powerful signal of growing confidence and mainstream acceptance within the financial world. The Astonishing Surge in Spot Ethereum ETFs: A New Era? Last week marked a historic moment for the cryptocurrency market. According to data cited by Cointelegraph on X, drawing from SosoValue, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs collectively pulled in an astounding $2.18 billion in net inflows. This figure represents their largest weekly intake to date, highlighting a remarkable shift in investor sentiment and appetite for exposure to Ethereum. To put this into perspective, let’s look at how it stacks up against its older sibling, Bitcoin: Asset Class Weekly Net Inflows Significance Spot Ethereum ETFs $2.18 Billion Largest weekly inflow since inception. Spot Bitcoin ETFs $2.39 Billion Continued strong performance, slightly outpacing ETH last week. While Bitcoin ETFs still saw a slightly higher inflow, the performance of Spot Ethereum ETFs is particularly notable given their relatively recent launch. This substantial capital injection suggests that traditional finance is increasingly comfortable allocating significant funds to Ethereum, viewing it as a legitimate and promising asset class with immense potential for growth. What’s Fueling the Momentum Behind Spot Ethereum ETFs? So, what exactly is driving this monumental influx into Spot Ethereum ETFs ? Several key factors are likely at play, creating a perfect storm of positive sentiment and investment appetite: Anticipation of SEC Approval: The primary catalyst has been the growing expectation of full regulatory approval for these ETFs. While some initial approvals have occurred, full trading commencement is eagerly awaited. The market often “buys the rumor,” and the strong inflows indicate investors are positioning themselves ahead of what they believe will be a major green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Bitcoin ETF Precedent: The successful launch and sustained performance of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year set a powerful precedent. They demonstrated a clear demand for regulated crypto investment products and paved the way for other digital assets like Ethereum to follow suit. Investors have seen how accessible and liquid these products can be within traditional financial markets. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Beyond regulatory news, Ethereum itself continues to evolve as a robust and innovative blockchain. Its dominance in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various decentralized applications (dApps) makes it a compelling investment. Investors are betting on the continued utility and adoption of the Ethereum network for various real-world applications. Institutional Appetite: Large financial institutions are constantly seeking new avenues for diversification and growth. Spot Ethereum ETFs offer a regulated, familiar vehicle for these institutions to gain exposure to the crypto market without the complexities of direct crypto custody and management, making it an attractive option for large-scale investments. This confluence of factors suggests a maturing market where digital assets are increasingly seen not just as speculative plays, but as legitimate and valuable components of a diversified investment portfolio. Spot Ethereum ETFs: Benefits for Savvy Investors For both institutional and retail investors, the emergence and success of Spot Ethereum ETFs offer several compelling advantages: Enhanced Accessibility: Perhaps the most significant benefit is that these ETFs make investing in Ethereum as straightforward as buying a stock. Investors can gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts, bypassing the need to set up crypto wallets, manage private keys, or navigate complex cryptocurrency exchanges. Regulatory Clarity and Security: Operating within a regulated framework, Spot Ethereum ETFs provide a level of oversight and security that can be reassuring to many investors. This reduces concerns about hacks, fraud, or unregulated market practices often associated with direct crypto investments, fostering greater trust. Liquidity and Price Discovery: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, offering high liquidity. This means investors can easily buy and sell shares throughout the trading day at market prices, contributing to efficient price discovery for Ethereum based on real-time supply and demand. Portfolio Diversification: For traditional portfolios, adding exposure to a digital asset like Ethereum can offer diversification benefits, given its potentially low correlation with traditional asset clas",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/spot-ethereum-etfs-inflow-2/,ETH|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|BTC,Crypto News|Crypto Inflows|Digital Assets|ETFs|ETHEREUM|Investment,BTC,"Spot Ethereum ETFs Witness Astonishing $2.18 Billion Inflow Surge.

The digital realm is often likened to a vast ocean, and within it, certain entities move with immense power and influence – the legendary crypto whales. Recently, the spotlight has been firmly fixed on a specific Hyperliquid whale , an address identified as 0x4a20, whose audacious moves are sending ripples across the decentralized finance landscape. This isn’t just any large trader; this is an entity known for accumulating a staggering $73.66 million in profits on the cutting-edge decentralized exchange, Hyperliquid. Now, this very whale has made headlines again, initiating high-leverage long positions totaling an astonishing $121 million across Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), HYPE, and PEPE. What does such a massive play signify, and what can we learn from the bold strategies of a Hyperliquid whale ? Unveiling the Hyperliquid Whale’s Colossal Crypto Play The crypto world thrives on significant movements, and few are as impactful as those made by large-scale investors, often dubbed ‘whales.’ According to a recent alert from Lookonchain on X, the 0x4a20 address, a recognized profit powerhouse on Hyperliquid, has deployed a massive capital allocation into several key cryptocurrencies. This isn’t a simple spot purchase; these are high-leverage long positions, amplifying both potential gains and risks. Let’s break down the specifics of this remarkable Hyperliquid whale trade: Bitcoin (BTC): A 40x leverage position. This means for every dollar the whale puts in, they control $40 worth of BTC. Ethereum (ETH): A 25x leverage position, showcasing strong conviction in the leading altcoin. HYPE: A 10x leverage position. HYPE, being a newer or smaller cap asset, indicates a specific belief in its short-term upside. PEPE: Also a 10x leverage position, highlighting the whale’s willingness to bet on the volatile meme coin market. The sheer scale of this move is breathtaking: a total position size of $121 million. As of the initial reports, these positions have already generated an unrealized gain of $1.14 million, a testament to the immediate market reaction or the whale’s timing. Such a significant deployment of capital by a seasoned Hyperliquid whale warrants a deeper look into the mechanics and implications of high-leverage trading. Understanding High-Leverage Crypto Trading: A Double-Edged Sword High-leverage trading is a powerful tool in the crypto derivatives market, allowing traders to open positions larger than their actual capital. While it offers the tantalizing prospect of amplified profits, it comes with equally amplified risks. For a Hyperliquid whale to employ such high leverage, it suggests a strong conviction in their market outlook, but also a calculated acceptance of significant potential downside. Here’s a simplified look at how leverage works and its inherent dynamics: Aspect Description Implication for Hyperliquid Whale Amplified Gains A small price movement in your favor results in a much larger profit relative to your initial capital. The $1.14 million unrealized gain from a $121 million position is significant, but it’s the percentage return on the whale’s actual capital that’s truly amplified. Amplified Losses Conversely, a small price movement against your position can lead to substantial losses. Even a slight dip in BTC or ETH could quickly erode the whale’s initial margin, potentially leading to liquidation. Liquidation Risk If the market moves too far against your leveraged position, the exchange will automatically close your position to prevent further losses, resulting in the loss of your collateral. For a 40x BTC long, a mere 2.5% drop in BTC price could trigger liquidation if not managed properly with additional collateral. The fact that this particular Hyperliquid whale has consistently generated profits suggests a sophisticated understanding of market dynamics and potentially advanced risk management strategies, even with such high leverage. Why Hyperliquid? The Platform of Choice for a Crypto Whale The choice of exchange for such a monumental trade is as important as the trade itself. Hyperliquid is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that has gained significant traction for its high performance and robust infrastructure. Unlike centralized exchanges, Hyperliquid operates on a blockchain, offering transparency and censorship resistance, which can be appealing to large traders who value self-custody and autonomy. Key features that might attract a Hyperliquid whale include: Decentralization: No single point of failure or central custodian holding funds. High Throughput: Capable of handling a large volume of trades quickly, crucial for high-frequency or large-scale strategies. Low Latency: Essential for precision trading, allowing for quick execution of orders. Competitive Fees: Often lower trading fees compared to some centralized counterpart",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/hyperliquid-whale-crypto-bet/,MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BTC|ETH,Crypto News|BITCOIN|crypto trading|ETHEREUM|Hyperliquid|whale,BTC,"Unveiling the Hyperliquid Whale’s Audacious $121M Crypto Bet.

2025-07-21 04:25:18+00:00,Unleashing Power: How Institutional Crypto Demand Fuels Bitcoin & Ethereum’s Ascent,"BitcoinWorld Unleashing Power: How Institutional Crypto Demand Fuels Bitcoin & Ethereum’s Ascent Are you wondering what’s truly driving the recent impressive gains in the cryptocurrency market? Look no further than the powerful wave of institutional crypto demand . This isn’t just about individual investors anymore; major players are stepping in, reshaping the landscape for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in ways we haven’t seen before. Why is Institutional Crypto Demand Surging? The cryptocurrency market has always been known for its volatility, but recent trends suggest a significant shift. What’s behind this growing appetite from large institutions? According to Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto Research, a key factor is the increasing recognition of digital assets as legitimate long-term investments. This isn’t a speculative gamble for these entities; it’s a strategic allocation. Maturity of the Market: As regulatory frameworks evolve and infrastructure improves, the crypto market becomes more accessible and less risky for institutional players. Inflation Hedging: In an era of economic uncertainty, Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” is seen as a potential hedge against inflation, attracting corporate treasuries. Diversification: Adding cryptocurrencies to a traditional portfolio offers diversification benefits, potentially enhancing returns and reducing overall risk. Growing Ecosystem: The expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and blockchain technology makes the underlying assets like Ethereum more appealing for their utility. These factors collectively contribute to a robust foundation of institutional crypto demand , indicating a deeper integration of digital assets into the global financial system. How is Bitcoin Benefiting from Institutional Crypto Demand? Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, continues to lead the charge. Min Jung highlights that BTC is maintaining its position near all-time highs, primarily due to sustained interest from institutional investors. These aren’t just any investors; we’re talking about crypto treasury firms and other large-scale entities that typically adopt a long-term holding strategy. What does this mean for the market? Aspect Impact of Institutional Demand on Bitcoin Price Stability Long-term holders reduce selling pressure, contributing to a more stable price floor. Reduced Volatility While short-term fluctuations can occur from profit-taking, institutional conviction dampens extreme downside movements. Increased Legitimacy Corporate adoption enhances Bitcoin’s credibility as a mainstream asset. Market Depth Large capital injections create deeper liquidity pools, making large trades less disruptive. According to The Block, this sustained influx of institutional crypto demand suggests that a significant near-term sell-off for Bitcoin is unlikely. However, Jung wisely cautions that some short-term volatility might arise from older wallets engaging in profit-taking after recent price breakouts. This is a natural market dynamic and not necessarily indicative of a weakening trend. Is Ethereum Also Seeing Strong Institutional Crypto Demand? Absolutely! While Bitcoin often grabs the headlines, Ethereum is experiencing its own powerful surge in institutional momentum. Jung points out a significant trend: more and more publicly traded companies are integrating ETH into their corporate reserves. This move signifies a growing recognition of Ethereum’s utility beyond just a store of value, particularly its role as the backbone for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. A remarkable indicator of this robust institutional crypto demand for Ethereum comes from the performance of spot ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The Block reported that these ETFs have recently achieved record-setting net inflows, even surpassing Bitcoin ETFs on certain days. This is a compelling testament to the rising institutional confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and its fundamental value proposition. Key drivers for Ethereum’s institutional appeal include: Ecosystem Dominance: Ethereum hosts the largest number of decentralized applications (dApps), including DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces, making its native token (ETH) essential for interacting with these platforms. Staking Rewards: The transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Consensus Layer) and its proof-of-stake mechanism offers attractive staking yields, appealing to institutions seeking passive income. Technological Innovation: Ongoing upgrades and scaling solutions promise to enhance Ethereum’s efficiency and reduce transaction costs, further cementing its position as a leading blockchain platform.

2025-07-21 05:00:42+00:00,The Final Bitcoin Act: Here’s What To Expect As BTC Trends Sideways,"Bitcoin has already shown a lot of strength in recent times, pushing as high as $123,000 before trailing back down toward $117,000. So far, it looks like the digital asset has hit a roadblock and is now possibly looking at a peak. But analyst Merlijn The Trader has explained that it is far from over for Bitcoin with more rallies to come. He reveals that the Bitcoin price is yet to stage its ‘final act’, which must happen before there are talks of a top. Bitcoin 4-Year Cycle Is Still In Play After the Bitcoin price rallied to new all-time highs pre-halving, which had never happened before, there were talks that the 4-year cycle had been broken. For clarification, the 4-year cycle is tied to the Bitcoin halving events, which take place every four years, cutting block rewards for miners in half. Related Reading: Bitcoin Re-Enters Profit Zone As Greed Rises, But Rally To $200,000 Still Possible However, the reduction in block rewards is not the only interesting thing about the 4-year cycle, because each halving also ushers in a new bull market. This has been the case for the past three bull cycles, and Bitcoin is also expected to follow this. Historically, the market rallies for around a year after the halving, with the top being reached one year later. Going by this trend, the Bitcoin price and the crypto market at large are expected to keep rallying before topping later this year. Pointing to this 4-year cycle, the analyst forecasts another stretch of price increases. The chart shows that price often declines for one year and then rallies for three years, and so far, the Bitcoin price has only been rallying for two, leaving 2025 as another year for rallying. Additionally, Bitcoin is still a long way from levels that have previously marked the top of previous bull markets. Thus, there is still a while before it hits its peak in 2025. Besides, each bull cycle has seen Bitcoin rise 3x higher than its previous all-time highs, and it is year to hit even 2x higher than its previous $69,000 high. How High Can BTC Go? If the 4-year cycle is still in play, then it means that the Bitcoin price rally is far from done. In the analyst’s chart, he shows the possible top for Bitcoin based on past cycles, and BTC is still in the middle of the box. The top of this box puts the BTC price at around $200,000 before a top can be reached. Related Reading: XRP Hits New ATH, But $3.12 Retest Still In Play The analyst warns that Bitcoin is about to enter what he refers to as the “greenest stretch of them all”, pointing to another rally to all-time highs.

2025-07-21 05:10:19+00:00,UK Bitcoin Sale: The £5 Billion Decision That Could Reshape the Nation’s Finances,"BitcoinWorld UK Bitcoin Sale: The £5 Billion Decision That Could Reshape the Nation’s Finances The world of cryptocurrency is abuzz with news that the UK government is eyeing a colossal sale of seized Bitcoin (BTC) to bolster its struggling economy. This isn’t just about selling digital assets; it’s a bold financial maneuver that could have far-reaching implications for both the nation’s coffers and the broader crypto landscape. The proposed UK Bitcoin sale , valued at over £5 billion ($6.7 billion), aims to plug a significant budget deficit, marking a pivotal moment in how governments interact with digital currencies. What’s Behind the UK Bitcoin Sale? A Strategic Move or a Risky Gamble? In an unprecedented move, the UK Treasury, led by Chief Rachel Reeves, in collaboration with the UK Home Office, is setting the wheels in motion for the sale of a substantial cache of seized Bitcoin. This initiative, first reported by Cointelegraph citing The Telegraph, represents a direct response to the nation’s pressing economic downturn and the need to address a significant budget deficit. The plan involves working closely with police and other related agencies to establish a robust system for offloading these digital assets. While the exact total amount of Bitcoin seized by the UK government remains undisclosed, a significant portion of this digital hoard includes at least 61,000 BTC. This particular sum was confiscated in 2018 from a massive Chinese Ponzi scheme that had operations extending into the UK. The sheer scale of this seizure, now valued at billions of dollars, presents a unique opportunity for the government to generate much-needed revenue. However, it also raises critical questions about the long-term implications of such a sale. The decision to liquidate these assets is driven by the immediate fiscal pressures facing the UK. Like many nations, the UK has grappled with economic challenges, including inflation, supply chain disruptions, and the lingering effects of global events. By converting these seized digital assets into fiat currency, the government hopes to inject a substantial sum into the national budget, potentially funding public services or reducing national debt. This pragmatic approach highlights the evolving recognition of cryptocurrencies as valuable, albeit unconventional, assets in national finance. Is Selling Seized Bitcoin a Wise Financial Decision for the UK? While the prospect of a multi-billion-pound windfall is appealing, the proposed UK Bitcoin sale is not without its critics and potential pitfalls. One of the most vocal opponents is Jordan Walker, founder of the crypto advocacy group Bitcoin Collective. In a formal letter addressed to the UK government, Walker articulated concerns that selling what he terms “strategic assets” like Bitcoin to cover a short-term budget deficit could lead to “long-term consequences for the UK’s economic positioning.” Walker’s argument hinges on the idea that Bitcoin, often referred to as digital gold, could appreciate significantly over time. Liquidating it now, despite the immediate financial gain, might mean forfeiting potentially much greater future value. This perspective frames Bitcoin not merely as a seized asset to be disposed of, but as a potential long-term investment or even a strategic reserve for the nation, similar to traditional gold reserves or foreign currency holdings. Furthermore, the legal and diplomatic landscape surrounding these seized assets is complex. Chinese authorities, alongside victims of the original Ponzi scheme from which the 61,000 BTC were seized, are actively demanding the return of these funds. This adds a layer of international legal entanglement to the UK’s plans, potentially leading to disputes and delays. The government will need to navigate these demands carefully, balancing its financial needs with international legal obligations and ethical considerations. The debate also extends to the broader implications for the UK’s stance on digital assets. Will this sale signal a utilitarian view of crypto – merely as a means to an end – or will it be seen as a pragmatic step by a government willing to adapt to new financial realities? The outcome of this decision could set a precedent for how other nations manage similar seized assets in the future. Navigating the Legal Maze: Repatriation and Ownership of Seized Assets The legal framework surrounding seized digital assets, especially those obtained from international criminal enterprises, is intricate. The case of the 61,000 BTC from the Chinese Ponzi scheme is a prime example. While the UK government seized these funds within its jurisdiction, the original crime and its victims are predominantly in China. This creates a significant challenge regarding the rightful ownership and potential repatriation of the assets. International law often dictates that assets derived from criminal activity should, where possible, be returned to the victims or the jurisdiction where t",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uk-bitcoin-sale-decision/,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|FIAT|TRADING,Crypto News|bitcoin news|budget deficit|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Government Seizure|UK Bitcoin Sale,BTC,"UK Bitcoin Sale: The £5 Billion Decision That Could Reshape the Nation’s Finances.

The case of the 61,000 BTC from the Chinese Ponzi scheme is a prime example. While the UK government seized these funds within its jurisdiction, the original crime and its victims are predominantly in China. This creates a significant challenge regarding the rightful ownership and potential repatriation of the assets. International law often dictates that assets derived from criminal activity should, where possible, be returned to the victims or the jurisdiction where t"

2025-07-21 05:30:00+00:00,Michael Saylor Again Signals New Bitcoin Purchase,"The company’s bullish momentum propelled its market cap past $118 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin’s social media dominance recently surged to 43%, which is historically seen as a sign of short-term cooling, though analysts are still very divided on what BTC’s next move will be. Meanwhile, macro voices like Tim Draper argue that a declining US dollar—not halving cycles—will drive Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Strategy Gearing Up for More Bitcoin Michael Saylor, the co-founder of Strategy, hinted at another major Bitcoin (BTC) purchase after the company’s holdings surpassed $71 billion. On July 14, Strategy bought 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million, pushing its total stash to 601,550 BTC. This trove is now valued at over $71.4 billion,and generated around $28.5 billion in unrealized gains. This is according to data from SaylorTracker. Strategy continues to be a dominant force in the current Bitcoin bull cycle, alongside institutional investors, ETFs, and crypto exchanges. The company''s bullish stance paid off in equity markets as well. Strategy’s stock climbed 15.2% over the past month, which helped push its total market valuation past $118 billion. Strategy stock price over the past month (Source: Google Finance ) The surge coincides with the broader market momentum, including the overall crypto market capitalization almost breaching the $4 trillion mark in July and Bitcoin reaching new all-time highs. Strategy''s growing prominence was rewarded in December of 2024, when it was added to the Nasdaq 100 index, thanks to increased institutional interest. Many institutional investors seek Bitcoin exposure but are restricted by mandates that prevent direct crypto purchases. Instead, they turn to Bitcoin-focused public companies or corporate debt products as proxies. Macro strategist Lyn Alden explained that several fund managers are bound by rules that limit their portfolios to equities only, barring them from holding bonds, ETFs, or commodities—including Bitcoin itself. A prime example of this workaround is Vanguard. Despite its longstanding opposition to Bitcoin, Vanguard now owns 20 million shares of Strategy, which accounts for 8% of the company’s outstanding stock. This indirect investment strategy means that Bitcoin is getting integrated deeper into traditional finance, as even conservative legacy firms look for exposure through compliant, publicly traded vehicles. Social Buzz Signals Bitcoin Cooldown? Bitcoin’s new all-time high of close to $123,100 captured almost half of all crypto-related social media discussions and triggered debate about whether retail investors are driving the rally or still sitting on the sidelines. According to sentiment analysis platform Santiment, Bitcoin mentions made up 43.06% of all crypto chatter as its price peaked. This is an unusually high level of dominance that historically preceded short-term pullbacks. Analyst Brian Quinlivan pointed out that the sudden rise in discussion signals a potential wave of retail FOMO, which often coincides with local tops in the market. This contrasts with other industry views, like Bitwise’s André Dragosch. He believes retail interest is still limited despite Bitcoin’s record highs. Bitcoin social dominance (Source: Santiment ) Just days after the peak, Bitcoin retraced to around $117,011, reinforcing the pattern Santiment warned about. Quinlivan advised that waiting for sentiment to cool could provide a better entry point, and specifically pointed out similar optimism spikes on June 11 and July 7 that led to price dips. Despite these cautionary signals, not all analysts agree that the rally is nearing its end. BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr mentioned that Bitcoin has not yet triggered its “peak signal” metric, which typically indicates market overheating. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital’s Michael Harvey suggested the asset might enter a brief consolidation phase but still has room to climb higher by the end of the month. Bitcoin’s Future Driven by Dollar Decline Tim Draper, founding partner of Draper Associates, believes that macroeconomic forces, particularly the weakening of the US dollar, will play a larger role in Bitcoin’s future than the halving cycles that have traditionally driven its boom-and-bust patterns. In an interview , Draper predicted that the dollar could become extinct within the next 10 to 20 years, and described the current transition as an “anthropological leap forward.” He sees Bitcoin as a global “escape valve” from inflation, institutional distrust, and geopolitical instability, arguing that these larger forces are accelerating adoption of the supply-limited cryptocurrency.

2025-07-21 05:55:18+00:00,Bitcoin Dominance Plunges: Unlocking Explosive Altcoin Potential,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dominance Plunges: Unlocking Explosive Altcoin Potential Are you feeling the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely noticed a significant shift underway. For years, Bitcoin has reigned supreme, its market capitalization dwarfing all others. This metric, known as Bitcoin dominance , has long been a barometer for the health and direction of the broader crypto ecosystem. However, recent data points to a fascinating and potentially pivotal change: Bitcoin dominance has slipped to a four-month low, sparking renewed interest and excitement around altcoins. What does this mean for the future of your crypto portfolio? What is Bitcoin Dominance and Why Does it Matter? Understanding Bitcoin dominance is crucial for any crypto investor. Simply put, it’s the ratio of Bitcoin’s market capitalization to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it suggests that Bitcoin holds a larger share of the overall crypto market value, often indicating a ‘flight to safety’ during bearish periods or a period of strong Bitcoin-led rallies. Conversely, a decline in Bitcoin dominance often signals that altcoins are gaining traction, attracting more capital, and potentially outperforming Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin dominance has fluctuated. During the 2017 bull run, it saw a significant dip as altcoins exploded. It then rebounded, only to dip again during subsequent altcoin seasons. This metric provides a valuable lens through which to view market sentiment and capital flows. A shift in Bitcoin dominance can indicate: Changing Investor Sentiment: A move from conservative Bitcoin holdings to riskier, higher-potential altcoin investments. Emerging Narratives: New technologies or use cases in the altcoin space drawing significant attention. Market Maturation: The overall crypto market becoming more diversified and less solely dependent on Bitcoin’s movements. The Current Dip in Bitcoin Dominance : What’s Happening? Recent data from BeInCrypto reveals a compelling story. Over just five days, Bitcoin dominance has dropped from 64.5% to 60.9% – a significant 5.6 percentage point decline. This marks its lowest level in approximately four and a half months, a clear signal that the spotlight is shifting. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a trend that warrants close attention. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the change: Metric Previous (Approx. 5 Days Ago) Current (Approx.) Change Bitcoin Dominance 64.5% 60.9% -5.6 percentage points This decline in Bitcoin dominance suggests that capital is flowing out of Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. It’s a classic sign of an ‘altcoin season’ potentially brewing, where investors seek higher returns in assets with smaller market caps but greater growth potential. Why Are Altcoins Gaining on Bitcoin Dominance ? The shift away from high Bitcoin dominance isn’t arbitrary. Several factors contribute to altcoins capturing more of the market’s attention and capital. Understanding these drivers can help you anticipate future market movements: Innovation and Utility: Many altcoins are at the forefront of blockchain innovation, offering unique solutions in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), gaming, and supply chain management. These real-world applications and evolving ecosystems attract investors looking for utility beyond just a store of value. Lower Entry Barrier & Higher Volatility: Compared to Bitcoin’s relatively high price per coin, many altcoins offer a lower entry point, making them accessible to a wider range of investors. While this comes with higher risk, the potential for significant percentage gains is often more appealing, especially to those seeking aggressive growth. Specific Narratives and Hype Cycles: Certain altcoins or sectors (e.g., meme coins, AI tokens, Layer-2 solutions) can experience intense periods of hype and rapid price appreciation, drawing in retail and even institutional investors seeking to capitalize on emerging trends. Technological Advancements: Continuous development in blockchain technology, such as scalability improvements, cross-chain compatibility, and enhanced security features, makes various altcoin projects more robust and attractive. The collective strength of these factors is challenging the long-standing reign of Bitcoin dominance , ushering in a more diversified and dynamic crypto landscape. Navigating the Shifting Tides: Opportunities and Challenges Beyond Bitcoin Dominance A declining Bitcoin dominance presents both exciting opportunities and inherent challenges for investors. It’s crucial to approach this shift with a balanced perspective. Opportunities: Diversification Benefits: Relying solely on Bitcoin can limit potential gains.

While Bitcoin’s price movements often grab headlines, the underlying sentiment among traders, particularly in the derivatives market, offers invaluable clues. Today, we’re diving deep into the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures , a critical metric that reveals how traders are positioning themselves on major exchanges. Are they bullish, expecting prices to rise, or bearish, anticipating a decline? Let’s unpack these numbers and discover what they tell us about the collective pulse of the Bitcoin market. Decoding the Mystery: What Are BTC Perpetual Futures and Long-Short Ratios? Before we dissect the data, it’s essential to grasp the core concepts. What exactly are BTC perpetual futures , and why do long-short ratios matter? BTC Perpetual Futures Explained: Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. They are derivative products that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying asset. They are ‘perpetual’ because they can be held indefinitely, as long as the trader meets margin requirements. This makes them incredibly popular for both short-term speculation and long-term hedging strategies, attracting significant liquidity and reflecting a broad spectrum of market views on Bitcoin’s future price. Understanding Long-Short Ratios: The long-short ratio is a powerful indicator that measures the proportion of ‘long’ positions (bets on price increase) versus ‘short’ positions (bets on price decrease) among traders holding BTC perpetual futures contracts. Typically, this ratio is calculated based on the open interest, meaning the total number of outstanding contracts not yet settled. A ratio above 1.0 indicates more long positions, suggesting a generally bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1.0 points to a greater prevalence of short positions, signaling a bearish bias. It’s a real-time snapshot of trader confidence and fear, providing insights into the prevailing market psychology. Monitoring these ratios gives traders an edge, helping them gauge whether the market is overly optimistic or pessimistic, which can sometimes precede significant price movements. It’s a key piece of the puzzle when analyzing the intricate dynamics of the BTC perpetual futures market. Unveiling the BTC Perpetual Futures Market: A 24-Hour Snapshot Over the past 24 hours, the aggregated long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures across various cryptocurrency exchanges presented an intriguing picture. The market showed a slight lean towards bearish sentiment, with short positions marginally outweighing long positions. This collective stance provides a fascinating insight into the immediate outlook of traders. Here’s the overall breakdown: Metric Value Total Long Positions 49.18% Total Short Positions 50.82% This marginal dominance of short positions, though subtle, indicates that the collective sentiment among traders of BTC perpetual futures has a slight bias towards anticipating a price decline. It suggests that more capital is currently positioned to profit from a downward movement in Bitcoin’s price than an upward one. While not a definitive prediction, this slight bearish tilt is noteworthy and warrants closer examination, especially when considering the potential for either short squeezes or further downside pressure.

2025-07-21 06:30:18+00:00,"Ethereum Price: The Critical $4,000 Hurdle and Potential $3,130 Drop","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price: The Critical $4,000 Hurdle and Potential $3,130 Drop The cryptocurrency market is buzzing, and all eyes are on the incredible ascent of Ethereum price . Having recently touched its highest point in seven months at $3,745, ETH has delivered an impressive 27% gain over the past week, igniting hopes of a sustained bull run. But as the digital asset approaches the psychologically significant $4,000 mark, a critical question looms: will this be a triumphant breakout leading to new highs, or a formidable resistance that could trigger a significant pullback? The answer to this will profoundly impact the immediate future of Ethereum price . Ethereum Price Soars: Understanding the Bullish Momentum Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has been on a remarkable upward trajectory. Its recent surge to $3,745 is not just a numerical achievement; it reflects a confluence of factors contributing to strong market confidence. One of the most compelling indicators of this bullish sentiment comes from the significant movement of ETH away from centralized exchanges (CEXs). According to insights shared by crypto analyst Wise Crypto on X, over 317,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $1.18 billion, has been withdrawn from CEXs recently. This massive outflow is a classic bullish signal for several reasons: Reduced Selling Pressure: When investors move their assets off exchanges, it typically means they intend to hold them for the long term rather than sell them immediately. This reduces the available supply on exchanges, which can lead to increased scarcity and upward pressure on the Ethereum price . Accumulation Phase: Large withdrawals often indicate that institutional investors or ‘whales’ are accumulating ETH, believing its value will increase in the future. Their actions can heavily influence market dynamics and signal strong underlying demand. Increased Confidence: Such significant accumulation suggests a high degree of confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem, its ongoing development, and its potential for future growth, reinforcing a positive outlook for the Ethereum price . This accumulation trend underscores a prevailing sentiment of optimism among holders, setting the stage for what many hope will be a continued ascent for the Ethereum price . Decoding the “Belief-Denial” Phase for Ethereum Price While the recent gains are exciting, seasoned analysts like Wise Crypto are also pointing to a crucial phase on the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) chart: the “Belief-Denial” zone. To understand its significance for the Ethereum price , let’s break down what NUPL is and what this phase implies: What is NUPL? NUPL is an on-chain metric that measures the total profit or loss of all coins in circulation, based on the difference between their current price and the price at which they were last moved. It helps gauge the overall market sentiment and investor psychology. The “Belief-Denial” Zone: This specific zone on the NUPL chart typically occurs after a significant price rally but before the market reaches its euphoric peak. Historically, it’s a period where many holders are sitting on substantial unrealized profits. While optimism is high, it also signals a point where profit-taking begins to accelerate, as investors start to “believe” in the rally but “deny” that a correction could be imminent. Historical Precedent: Past market cycles have shown that entering the “Belief-Denial” phase often precedes market corrections or periods of consolidation as early investors realize their gains. This doesn’t necessarily mean a crash is imminent, but it does suggest that the Ethereum price might face increased selling pressure as holders look to secure their profits. Understanding this psychological phase is vital for investors, as it highlights the delicate balance between continued growth and the natural impulse for profit realization, which could impact the trajectory of the Ethereum price . The Critical $4,000 Threshold: Will Ethereum Price Break Out or Pull Back? The $4,000 mark is not just another number for Ethereum price ; it represents a major psychological and technical resistance level. For many, it’s a gateway to uncharted territory, reminiscent of its all-time high set in November 2021. The market’s reaction at this level will be pivotal for the short-to-medium term outlook of ETH. Scenario 1: A Clean Breakout Above $4,000 If Ethereum price manages a “clean breakout” above $4,000 – meaning it not only touches but decisively holds above this level, perhaps even turning it into support – it could trigger a fresh, powerful rally. This scenario would likely: Fuel Investor Confidence: A decisive break would confirm strong buying pressure and potentially attract new capital, pushing the Ethereum price towards new highs. Liquidate Short Positions: Traders who bet against ETH (short positions) would be forced to buy back, adding to the upward momentum.

Last week’s economic data confirmed that the US economy continues to show health and improvement, with a rebound in retail sales and a fall in jobless claims. Additionally, CPI and PPI reports showed that core price increases remain subdued. The week ahead will have some housing data and PMIs that rarely influence crypto market movements, and the weekend has been quiet in terms of tariff news. Economic Events July 21 to 25 Wednesday will see June’s existing home sales reports released, which provide insights into the health of the housing market and economy, but have no impact on high-risk assets. July’s Global Manufacturing PMI and Services PMI (purchasing managers’ indexes) are due on Thursday. These reports are leading economic indicators used to gain timely insights into changing economic conditions. Friday will see reports on June’s Durable Goods Orders, which measure the cost of orders received by manufacturers for durable goods and help assess the state of production activity and demand for big-ticket items. Key Events This Week: 1. Fed Chair Powell Speaks – Tuesday 2. June Existing Home Sales data – Wednesday 3. July S&P Global Manufacturing PMI data – Thursday 4. June New Home Sales data – Thursday 5.

The first of the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants will report second-quarter earnings this week, and they include Google parent Alphabet and Tesla. This earnings season “seems to be especially important because of the rebound that the market has had,” Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services, told Reuters before adding, “I would think that that has built in a fair amount of optimism in terms of earnings.” Crypto Market Outlook Total market capitalization has retreated a little following its weekend peak of over $4 trillion. Nevertheless, it has been a bullish year for crypto with markets gaining 17.6% since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin dipped below $117,000 during late trading on Sunday but managed to reclaim the $118,000 level during the Asian session on Monday morning. The asset has spent the past few days consolidating around this level since it fell below $120,000 late last week. Ethereum is still outperforming, however, with a Sunday surge to top $3,800 in a seven-month high. ETH has gained a whopping 46% over the past fortnight but has cooled to $3,744 at the time of writing. Other assets performing well this Monday morning include Dogecoin with a 7.4% pump to reach $0.27, Cardano tapping $0.87 after a 4% gain, Stellar spiking to $0.48, and Chainlink adding 5% to close in on $20.

Recently, the digital asset operating company, Vaultz Capital, made headlines with its latest Bitcoin acquisition , adding another 20 BTC to its reserves. This strategic move not only expands their holdings but also underscores a growing trend of institutional confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, understanding these large-scale investments is crucial to gauge future trajectories and market sentiment. Vaultz Capital’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: What Does it Mean? Vaultz Capital, a prominent name in the digital asset space, has once again demonstrated its conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. According to a regulatory filing, which was brought to light by @btcNLNico on X, the company successfully acquired an additional 20 BTC. This latest purchase is not just a routine transaction; it signifies a deliberate expansion of their digital asset portfolio. With this recent addition, Vaultz Capital’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at an impressive 70 BTC. This Bitcoin acquisition by Vaultz Capital is more than just an increase in numbers; it reflects a broader institutional strategy. Companies like Vaultz Capital operate with a clear vision: to manage and grow digital assets for their clients, navigating the complexities of the crypto market with expertise. Their decision to accumulate more Bitcoin suggests a strong belief in its role as a foundational asset in the digital economy. It’s a testament to the evolving perception of Bitcoin from a speculative asset to a recognized store of value and a strategic investment. To put this into perspective, let’s look at how Vaultz Capital’s Bitcoin holdings have grown: Period Bitcoin Acquired (BTC) Total Holdings (BTC) Prior to Latest Acquisition N/A 50 BTC Latest Acquisition 20 BTC 70 BTC This consistent accumulation strategy by a professional digital asset firm provides a valuable signal to the market, indicating sustained institutional interest and a bullish long-term outlook for Bitcoin. Why Are Institutions Increasing Their Bitcoin Holdings? The trend of institutional Bitcoin acquisition is not unique to Vaultz Capital. Across the globe, more and more companies, hedge funds, and even sovereign wealth funds are exploring or actively investing in Bitcoin. But what drives this increasing appetite for the volatile yet promising cryptocurrency? Several factors contribute to this growing institutional confidence: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against currency debasement. Its fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently scarce, similar to gold, which appeals to investors looking to preserve purchasing power. Digital Gold Narrative: The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ has gained significant traction. It shares characteristics with traditional safe-haven assets, offering a decentralized, borderless, and censorship-resistant alternative to conventional financial systems. Long-Term Store of Value: Despite its price volatility, many institutions view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. They are looking beyond short-term fluctuations, focusing on its potential to appreciate significantly over decades as digital economies expand. Increasing Regulatory Clarity: While challenges remain, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is gradually becoming clearer in many jurisdictions. This evolving clarity provides institutions with greater confidence to allocate capital to digital assets, reducing perceived risks. Growing Market Maturity: The cryptocurrency market has matured considerably since Bitcoin’s inception. The development of robust infrastructure, including institutional-grade custody solutions, derivatives markets, and regulated exchanges, makes it easier and safer for large entities to engage with Bitcoin. These factors collectively paint a picture of a maturing asset class that is slowly but surely integrating into the traditional financial ecosystem, making institutional Bitcoin acquisition a logical strategic move for forward-thinking firms. The Broader Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Acquisition on the Market When major players like Vaultz Capital make significant Bitcoin acquisition moves, the effects reverberate throughout the entire cryptocurrency market. These actions contribute to a range of positive impacts, but also present certain considerations: Enhanced Market Confidence: Large institutional investments serve as a strong vote of confidence.

2025-07-21 06:45:18+00:00,"Bitcoin Bonanza: The Blockchain Group’s Astounding 1,373% Yield","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Bonanza: The Blockchain Group’s Astounding 1,373% Yield In the dynamic world of digital assets, where market shifts can happen in the blink of an eye, institutional moves often signal significant trends. For those keenly observing the cryptocurrency space, the recent announcement from French blockchain firm The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) has sent ripples of excitement. This prominent player has once again demonstrated its unwavering conviction in the leading digital currency by significantly increasing its Bitcoin holdings, a strategic move that underscores the growing institutional appetite for this decentralized asset. Why The Blockchain Group is Doubling Down on Bitcoin? The Blockchain Group (ALTBG) recently made headlines with its strategic acquisition of an additional 22 Bitcoin (BTC). This latest purchase, valued at approximately €2.2 million (around $2.56 million), is not just a casual investment; it’s a bold statement of confidence. This acquisition pushes their total Bitcoin reserves to an impressive 1,955 BTC, solidifying their position as a significant corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. What drives such a substantial commitment? Long-Term Vision: ALTBG’s consistent accumulation of Bitcoin suggests a strong belief in its long-term value proposition as a store of value and a hedge against traditional economic uncertainties. They are not merely trading; they are building a robust treasury. Strategic Asset Allocation: For a firm deeply embedded in the blockchain ecosystem, integrating Bitcoin into their balance sheet is a natural extension of their core business. It aligns with their expertise and positions them at the forefront of digital asset innovation. Market Confidence: By publicly announcing their purchases, companies like ALTBG contribute to the overall confidence in the crypto market. Such moves often inspire other institutional and retail investors to consider similar strategies, further legitimizing Bitcoin as a viable investment asset. This deliberate accumulation strategy highlights a broader trend: an increasing number of corporations are recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate component of a diversified corporate treasury strategy. It’s a clear signal that digital assets are moving from the fringe to the mainstream. Unpacking The Blockchain Group’s Astounding Bitcoin Yield Perhaps even more striking than their recent purchase is The Blockchain Group’s reported year-to-date (YTD) Bitcoin yield: a staggering 1,373.2%. This figure is an extraordinary testament to their strategic prowess and market timing. How does a company achieve such an impressive return on its Bitcoin holdings? While the specifics of ALTBG’s yield generation strategy are not fully disclosed, such high returns in the crypto space typically stem from a combination of factors: Strategic Accumulation: Buying Bitcoin at opportune moments, especially during market dips, allows for a lower average cost basis. When the market recovers and prices surge, the returns on these earlier purchases become substantial. Long-Term Holding (HODLing): The core principle of “HODLing” involves holding onto assets through market volatility, rather than selling during downturns. Given Bitcoin’s historical upward trend over multi-year periods, this strategy can yield significant returns for patient investors. Yield-Generating Activities: Some firms engage in various decentralized finance (DeFi) activities or lending protocols with their Bitcoin holdings to generate additional yield. This could involve staking, lending out BTC for interest, or participating in liquidity pools. While the announcement doesn’t specify, a firm like ALTBG with blockchain expertise might leverage such avenues. Favorable Market Conditions: It’s also crucial to acknowledge that such a high yield is often a reflection of a strong bull market for Bitcoin during the reporting period. The significant appreciation in Bitcoin’s price would naturally contribute to a substantial yield for holders. To put this yield into perspective, consider the typical returns from traditional investments: Investment Type Typical Annual Yield/Return (Approx.) The Blockchain Group’s BTC YTD Yield Savings Account 0.5% – 2% 1,373.2% Government Bonds 2% – 5% Stock Market Index (e.g., S&P 500) 7% – 10% (historical average) Real Estate (Rental Yield) 3% – 7% Comparison of Typical Investment Returns vs. The Blockchain Group’s Bitcoin Yield This comparison vividly illustrates the immense potential for returns within the cryptocurrency market, albeit accompanied by higher volatility and risk.

2025-07-21 06:55:19+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Explodes: BTC Surges Past $119,000 Milestone","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Explodes: BTC Surges Past $119,000 Milestone The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again captured global attention, soaring past the significant $119,000 mark. This remarkable ascent has sent ripples across financial markets, reigniting optimism among investors and prompting renewed discussions about the future trajectory of digital assets. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just beginning to explore the fascinating realm of decentralized finance, understanding the dynamics behind this surge in Bitcoin price is crucial. Let’s delve into what’s driving this impressive climb and what it could mean for the broader market. Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Surge According to diligent market monitoring, the leading cryptocurrency, BTC, has indeed breached the $119,000 threshold. Specifically, data from the Binance USDT market shows BTC trading at a noteworthy $119,057.8. This isn’t just a number; it represents a significant psychological and technical level for many traders and analysts. Such a rapid upward movement often signals strong buying pressure and growing confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Historically, significant price milestones for Bitcoin often precede periods of increased investor interest and market activity. This latest surge highlights Bitcoin’s enduring volatility but also its incredible resilience and potential for substantial gains. Key Market Observations: Strong Buying Momentum: The push past $119,000 indicates considerable demand. Increased Market Confidence: Investors show renewed belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. High Liquidity: Active participation from both retail and institutional players. To put this into perspective, let’s consider a simplified view of how such price movements are often perceived: Metric Implication of BTC Above $119,000 Market Sentiment Highly Bullish, FOMO potentially increasing. Investor Behavior Accumulation and holding strategies gaining traction. Future Outlook Potential for further upside. What Factors Influence Bitcoin Price Movements? Understanding why the Bitcoin price moves the way it does is key to deciphering its future. Several interconnected factors contribute to its volatility and long-term trends. Supply and Demand Dynamics: Bitcoin’s price is fundamentally influenced by supply and demand. With a finite supply of 21 million coins, scarcity drives its value. Halving events, which reduce the rate of new Bitcoin creation, directly impact supply, often leading to price appreciation over time as demand increases. Institutional Adoption: The growing involvement of large financial institutions and corporations significantly impacts the Bitcoin price . When major players integrate crypto services or acquire Bitcoin, it signals legitimacy and injects substantial capital into the market, boosting demand and confidence. Macroeconomic Factors: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical tensions can drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Its appeal as “digital gold” grows when traditional markets show weakness, positively influencing its price. Regulatory Developments: Government regulations play a crucial role. Clear and favorable regulations foster mainstream adoption and investment, while restrictive policies can create FUD and depress the price. The global regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, with each development swaying market sentiment and the Bitcoin price . Technological Advancements: Improvements in Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as scalability solutions or enhanced security features, increase its utility and attractiveness. The overall health of the Bitcoin network also contributes to investor confidence. Is This Bitcoin Price Rally Sustainable? Every significant rally in the crypto market prompts the question: how long will it last? While certainty is elusive, we can analyze historical patterns and current conditions to form an informed perspective on the sustainability of the current Bitcoin price surge. Potential Tailwinds: Growing Retail Interest: Renewed media attention often attracts new retail investors. Halving Cycle Influence: Post-halving periods historically see significant bull runs. Increasing Utility: Bitcoin’s use cases as a payment rail and store of value continue to expand. Global Economic Shifts: Inflation concerns could push more capital into decentralized assets. Potential Headwinds and Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for sharp corrections. Regulatory Scrutiny: Overly restrictive measures could temper enthusiasm.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Explodes: BTC Surges Past $119,000 Milestone The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again captured global attention, soaring past the significant $119,000 mark. This remarkable ascent has sent ripples across financial markets, reigniting optimism among investors and prompting renewed discussions about the future trajectory of digital assets. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto enthusiast or just beginning to explore the fascinating realm of decentralized finance, understanding the dynamics behind this surge in Bitcoin price is crucial. Let’s delve into what’s driving this impressive climb and what it could mean for the broader market. Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Surge According to diligent market monitoring, the leading cryptocurrency, BTC, has indeed breached the $119,000 threshold. Specifically, data from the Binance USDT market shows BTC trading at a noteworthy $119,057.8. This isn’t just a number; it represents a significant psychological and technical level for many traders and analysts. Such a rapid upward movement often signals strong buying pressure and growing confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition. Historically, significant price milestones for Bitcoin often precede periods of increased investor interest and market activity. This latest surge highlights Bitcoin’s enduring volatility but also its incredible resilience and potential for substantial gains. Key Market Observations: Strong Buying Momentum: The push past $119,000 indicates considerable demand. Increased Market Confidence: Investors show renewed belief in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. High Liquidity: Active participation from both retail and institutional players. To put this into perspective, let’s consider a simplified view of how such price movements are often perceived: Metric Implication of BTC Above $119,000 Market Sentiment Highly Bullish, FOMO potentially increasing. Investor Behavior Accumulation and holding strategies gaining traction. Future Outlook Potential for further upside. What Factors Influence Bitcoin Price Movements? Understanding why the Bitcoin price moves the way it does is key to deciphering its future. Several interconnected factors contribute to its volatility and long-term trends. Supply and Demand Dynamics: Bitcoin’s price is fundamentally influenced by supply and demand. With a finite supply of 21 million coins, scarcity drives its value. Halving events, which reduce the rate of new Bitcoin creation, directly impact supply, often leading to price appreciation over time as demand increases. Institutional Adoption: The growing involvement of large financial institutions and corporations significantly impacts the Bitcoin price . When major players integrate crypto services or acquire Bitcoin, it signals legitimacy and injects substantial capital into the market, boosting demand and confidence. Macroeconomic Factors: Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against traditional financial instability. Inflation, interest rate changes, and geopolitical tensions can drive investors towards alternative assets like Bitcoin. Its appeal as “digital gold” grows when traditional markets show weakness, positively influencing its price. Regulatory Developments: Government regulations play a crucial role. Clear and favorable regulations foster mainstream adoption and investment, while restrictive policies can create FUD and depress the price. The global regulatory landscape is constantly evolving, with each development swaying market sentiment and the Bitcoin price . Technological Advancements: Improvements in Bitcoin’s underlying technology, such as scalability solutions or enhanced security features, increase its utility and attractiveness. The overall health of the Bitcoin network also contributes to investor confidence. Is This Bitcoin Price Rally Sustainable? Every significant rally in the crypto market prompts the question: how long will it last? While certainty is elusive, we can analyze historical patterns and current conditions to form an informed perspective on the sustainability of the current Bitcoin price surge. Potential Tailwinds: Growing Retail Interest: Renewed media attention often attracts new retail investors. Halving Cycle Influence: Post-halving periods historically see significant bull runs. Increasing Utility: Bitcoin’s use cases as a payment rail and store of value continue to expand. Global Economic Shifts: Inflation concerns could push more capital into decentralized assets. Potential Headwinds and Challenges: Market Volatility: Bitcoin is known for sharp corrections. Regulatory Scrutiny: Overly restrictive measures could temper enthusiasm. Macroeconomic Downturns: A severe global recession might lead to a broader risk-off environment. Competition: Other cryptocurrencies could present long-term competitive pressures. The rally’s sustainability depends on these factors. Continued institutional adoption, favorable regulatory cl"

XRP Poised For $10 If This Happens In a series of posts over the weekend, the analyst noted that XRP’s monthly chart against BTC is “coiling” just beneath a crucial Ichimoku Cloud threshold at 2,674 satoshis. “If this month closes above 2 674 I think we should go at least to 4 135 in the next couple of months,” Dr Cat wrote, adding that such a close would deliver the first bullish monthly kumo twist for the pair since 2018 and place XRP in a “support‑and‑regain” configuration rarely seen in altcoins during the current cycle. The 4,135–7,600 satoshi band marks what Dr Cat calls the “resistance / take‑profit zone.” He argues that price seldom reloads immediately after such a multi‑year breakout and that a wick to the upper end of the zone is likely once momentum ignites. Related Reading: Analyst Says You Should Be Preparing To Exit XRP — Here’s Why “All in all, if BTC goes to 144 K on this weekly move, this price range for XRP in USD translates to $6–$10,” the analyst told followers, pencilling the move in for August or September if Bitcoin’s trend steepens. Dr Cat conceded that the optimal risk‑reward evaporates above 7,600 sats—“Would you risk a 10× unrealised gain for another 0.7×?”—and said he would rotate out of the position even though longer‑term targets above $30 remain “plausible” into 2026. On the XRP‑USD chart the picture is similarly constructive. Sunday’s weekly close above $3.37 turned both the cloud and the Kijun‑sen higher and produced a textbook Chikou Span breakout in week 27 of the Ichimoku time cycle, the so‑called Henka‑Bi candle. Dr Cat’s price‑projection grid aligns traditional Fibonacci extensions with Ichimoku price‑measurement theory: the N‑wave objective sits at $4.53, the E‑wave at $6.31 and the 2E extension at $9.22. “With the condition of this weekly close all of them are on the table for the next one to two months and $4.5 should be the absolute minimum,” he wrote, recalling that the same $4.5 target had been floated as “minimum” when XRP traded at $1.89 in early April. Market context lends partial support to the thesis. Bitcoin is trading just above $118,500 after a subdued weekend session, consolidating a 20 percent rally since the start of July, while ether holds near $3,760 and dominance continues to erode in favour of large‑cap altcoins. XRP itself is hovering around $3.55 following a 50‑percent weekly burst. Related Reading: XRP To $13 in 40 Days? Analyst Predicts Explosive Final Rally Technically, the “monthly close above 2,674 sats” remains the gating criterion. A failure to secure that level would postpone the kumo twist and risk another quarter of range‑bound drift versus Bitcoin. Conversely, a decisive move into the 4,135–7,600 satoshi band would confirm the first bullish market‑structure shift on the long‑term ratio chart in seven years and almost certainly drive speculative flows into the XRP‑USD pair. Traders watching for additional confirmation will be tracking whether the Chikou Span can clear price on the weekly timeframe “this or next week”—a rare but powerful signal that the analyst warns could invalidate the “healthy cross” caveat and send the market vertical even before the textbook Tenkan‑Kijun crossover materialises. For now, the path to $6–$10 hinges on Bitcoin’s ability to extend its breakout toward the six‑figure mark. If the flagship asset stalls below $120,000 the proportional upside for XRP compresses; should the rally continue, Dr Cat’s stacked Ichimoku‑Fibonacci objectives argue that $4.5 comes first, $6 follows quickly and the fabled $10 print is finally “on the table” as the trifecta of cloud twist, time‑cycle symmetry and momentum converge.

2025-07-21 07:04:28+00:00,JPMorgan Chase Says Stock Market Going ‘Meaningfully’ Higher in 12 Months Amid Resilient Corporate America,"Banking giant JPMorgan Chase believes that the US stock market is not finished rallying and will hit much higher levels in the coming months. In a new CNBC Television interview, JPMorgan Asset Management global market strategist Jordan Jackson says the bank does not expect the US to witness a recession in the next 12 months. The market strategist also believes that during the period, the stock market will print new all-time highs. “Markets do appear to be, as we flirt with all-time highs, sort of sanguine over the very, very near term. But that being said, I would say over the next 12 months, I think markets are going to be higher than where they are today, probably meaningfully so.” Jackson adds that Corporate America has been able to effectively navigate the uncertainty brought about by Trump’s shifting trade policies, solidifying his expectations of a stock market bull run. “The word I would describe for the earnings backdrop is ‘resilient.’ Companies came into this period of [uncertainty], really did a lot of cost-cutting measures, whether that would be reducing workforce or putting freezes on hiring, really working with their suppliers to either bear the brunt or have some of their foreign suppliers bear the brunt of higher tariffs. I think when you look at the broader backdrop, you’ve got to look at resiliency in some of the earnings. And I think we’ll see that in some of the tech earnings that we get over the course of [this] week. This question will be is forward guidance. What are they signaling over the next couple of quarters? We continue to hear a more cautious tone from CEOs with the expectation that the economy is going to begin to slow over the second half of this year. So it would be interesting to see what kind of forward guidance we get that informs our earnings expectations for the tail end of this year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-21 07:12:35+00:00,"Ether, Dogecoin Lead Capital Rotation Away From Bitcoin as Altcoin Fever Resurges","Bitcoin (BTC) hovered just under $120,000 in Asia trading hours Monday, up 1% on the day and 2.6% on the week, even as traders increasingly shifted capital into altcoins like ether (ETH), XRP (XRP), Solana’s SOL (SOL), and dogecoin (DOGE). The market rotation comes as institutional flows broaden beyond Bitcoin, with Ethereum-led narratives gaining momentum and real-world asset tokenization drawing fresh attention from traditional finance players. ETH surged to $3,793, posting a 3.7% daily gain and up 25% over the week. It’s now at its highest level since early 2022, and analysts say demand from new ETH-based treasury products and ongoing ETF flows are fueling the rally. XRP followed suit, rising 4.1% to $3.55, while SOL added 6.6% to reach $189. Cardano’s ADA) and BNB Coin (BNB) both gained over 3% on the day. Dogecoin (DOGE) stood out with a 9.6% jump in the past 24 hours, trading at 27 cents and up more than 33% on the week — its strongest performance in over a year. ""Over the past week, altcoins have shown signs of taking the spotlight, with Bitcoin stalling just below recent all-time highs and capital rotating into broader market plays,"" said Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at Brickken, in a note shared with CoinDesk. ""Bitcoin dominance has dropped from a June peak of 66% to around 61.75%, signaling early signs of an altcoin cycle heading into Q3,"" Cardozo said. The ETH/BTC ratio, which has been in decline for some time, has seen a strong bounce back to its best levels since Q1 — a sign that traders are again betting on Ethereum outperforming. ""Some will credit the stablecoin and RWA narrative,"" said Augustine Fan, head of insights at SignalPlus. ""But we think it’s just good old-fashioned risk-on spillover. Most TradFi players are already fully positioned on BTC."" Beyond technical positioning, macro and legislative tailwinds continue to shape the altcoin trade. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins and increase clarity around digital asset taxation, failed a procedural vote earlier this week but is still progressing in U.S. Congress. ""Ethereum and other altcoins are surging due to institutional demand and friendly legislative policies,"" said Eugene Cheung, chief commercial officer at OSL. ""Traders are hoping to see Ethereum break to new all-time highs, the last of the majors yet to do so in this cycle."" Meanwhile, the real-world asset (RWA) tokenization sector — now over $24 billion in total tokenized value — is becoming a serious institutional theme. Projects tokenizing private credit, Treasuries, and real estate are attracting fresh attention from giants like BlackRock and JPMorgan. ""Tokenized assets are taking a meaningful share of DeFi TVL,"" Cardozo added. ""It may be too early to call an altseason, but the rotation is real.
