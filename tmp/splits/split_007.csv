2025-07-21 14:47:34+00:00,Commodity strategist reveals what’s really powering the crypto rally,"Mike McGlone, Senior Commodity Strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence , shared some new thoughts on the future of crypto . Namely, in a July 21 post on X, McGlone stated that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies may be fine, provided the stock market keeps going up. “Bitcoin, cryptos may be fine, as long as the stock market keeps going up.” – Mike McGlone The strategist’s post was a reply to Scott Melker, the host of The Wolf Of All Streets podcast, whose most recent episode , featuring McGlone as a guest, tackles topics including Bitcoin’s recent bullish trend and stablecoin legalization. Bitcoin, cryptos may be fine, as long as the stock market keeps going up https://t.co/2eYnlaGJ8D — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) July 21, 2025 Why does the stock market matter for crypto? During the podcast discussion, McGlone expressed clearly the opinion that cryptocurrencies are intrinsically tied to the stock market , stating: “I can’t even have a view on cryptos … anymore without having a view of the stock market first. It’s got to go up first.” – Mike McGlone Another topic under discussion was the competitive nature of the market and the lack of retail euphoria in Bitcoin, given the difficulty new market entrants face when trying to explore crypto. Accordingly, McGlone argued that investors ought to approach Bitcoin as more akin to some kind of leverage stock that moves with the stock market, with an important note that past performance should not be taken as an indicator of future gains. Co-guest James Lavish of Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, however, challenged this view with a remark that Bitcoin has only had a few cycles, which is not enough to make any sort of objective analysis of the correlation between past and future success. “There will be cycles. There will be expansions and contractions of liquidity and credit, and I do believe that Bitcoin will follow that. And why is that? Because it is literally the opposite of fiat, and so if you want to protect your money, you buy gold or Bitcoin.” – James Lavish Lavish further added that institutional demand complicates the picture, especially given Bitcoin’s role in liquidity expansion.

2025-07-21 14:55:16+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Continues To Consolidate, Falls Short Of $120,000 Yet Again","Bitcoin (BTC) started the week on a positive note after a sluggish weekend that saw sellers push the price down to a low of $116,208 before it closed Sunday at $117,240. However, it fell short of $120,000, losing momentum after reaching an intraday high of $119,618 during the ongoing session. The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $118,295. Michael Saylor Teases Another Bitcoin (BTC) Buy Strategy co-founder and executive chairman Michael Saylor teased an imminent Bitcoin purchase as the value of the BTC treasury company’s holdings crossed $71 billion. Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase was on July 14, when it purchased 4,225 BTC for $472.5 million. The acquisition took the company’s total holdings to 601,550 BTC , valued at $71.4 billion at current prices. Strategy is up over 66% on its Bitcoin investment, and is sitting on $28.5 billion worth of unrealized gains. Bitcoin Treasury companies like Strategy are one of the biggest drivers of BTC’s current rally, alongside spot Bitcoin ETFs, crypto exchanges, and institutional investors. The company’s stock is up over 21%, surging as the crypto market rallies, with BTC hitting record levels. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Continue Inflow Streak Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered inflows of $363 million on Friday, extending their inflow streak to 12 days amid burgeoning investor interest. As expected, BlackRock’s IBIT led the inflows, adding $496 million, cementing its position as the largest spot Bitcoin ETF with over $86 billion in assets. However, Fidelity’s FBTC registered a marginal outflow of $17.94 million, while Grayscale’s GBTC saw outflows of over $81 million. Bitcoin ETFs have attracted around $6.6 billion in net inflows over the 12 days. July 10 registered the largest single-day inflow, worth $1.03 billion. This was also the first time Bitcoin ETFs registered over $1 billion in inflows on two consecutive days. Other notable inflows include $799 million on July 16 and $601 million on July 3. Charles Schwab To Offer Bitcoin, Ether Spot Trading Charles Schwab is planning to offer spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The plan was announced by CEO Rick Wurster, who said that Schwab’s clients already have substantial exposure to crypto through exchange-traded products (ETPs). However, Wurster noted that crypto makes up a very small portion of its clients’ total wealth, $25 billion out of $10.8 trillion. “We anticipate launching Bitcoin and Ether sometime soon so that our clients have access to that. We think that will be an acceleration of our growth.” Wurster stated that most clients keep 98% of their wealth with Schwab, but hold only 1-2% of their crypto assets with digital-native firms. “They really want to bring it back to Schwab because they trust us. They want us to sit alongside their other assets.” The introduction of spot crypto trading will see Charles Schwab compete with crypto exchanges like Coinbase. Wurster confirmed Schwab’s intention to compete with Coinbase, stating, “If they’re buying their crypto at Coinbase, we would love to see them bring their crypto back to Schwab.” The firm has increased its involvement in crypto in recent months amid growing regulatory clarity. In 2025, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Federal Reserve withdrew restrictive guidelines issued following the FTX collapse, allowing banks to participate in crypto and offer custody and trading services. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded after starting the week on a sluggish note. The flagship cryptocurrency has traded in a range since setting a new all-time high on Monday. BTC raced past $123,000 on Monday, reaching a new all-time high of $123,091 before settling at $119,714. It has struggled to regain $120,000 since, trading between $116,000 and $120,000 as buyers refused to cede ground to sellers, indicating that bullish sentiment remains intact. Price action remained muted over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal decline on Saturday and 0.48% on Sunday. The flagship cryptocurrency entered into a consolidation phase after Monday’s rally to a new all-time high, trading in a narrow range between $117,000 and $120,000. BTC maintained its position above $117,000-$118,000, indicating that bulls have not ceded ground to sellers. However, analysts believe BTC is gearing up for a big move, which could see it test the $123,000 level and return to price discovery. Trader Marcus Corvinus stated, “ BTC is getting ready for a big move. Bitcoin is moving inside a triangle pattern and staying above strong support around $116,000 to $117,000. Right now, it''s going sideways but not for long.” A breakout above $123,000 could take BTC past $125,000. However, if it slips below $117,000-$118,000, then markets can expect a drop to $110,000 or lower. “If it breaks below support, the price may fall to $111,000 or lower.” BTC registered a sharp increase on ",bitzo,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-continues-to-consolidate-falls-short-of-120000-yet-again,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS,Breaking News|Bitcoin,BTC,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Continues To Consolidate, Falls Short Of $120,000 Yet Again.

2025-07-21 14:55:35+00:00,Bitcoin (BTC) Breakout: New All-Time High or Just a Fakeout?,"Bitcoin (BTC) surged over $119,600 on Monday morning, up around $3,000 already on the day. However, volume is failing to come in to confirm that this breakout is legitimate. That said, there is still time. Could this breakout take out the previous all-time high and go to $130,000 and above? Where is Bitcoin going next? Where Bitcoin is going next, no person knows. It might well be speculated that given the disastrous state of nation budgets, and the huge likelihood of more central bank printing of fiat currencies, that assets such as Bitcoin will probably keep rising. However, there are no certainties, and the next black swan might be just around the corner. Kiyosaki warns of a Bitcoin “bust” Robert Kiyosaki, renowned author and entrepreneur, is warning of a Bitcoin “bust” that may be about to happen. He does say though, that if this does take place, he will be buying. While Kiyosaki certainly knows real estate, he is not an authority on Bitcoin, besides knowing that long term, it is a great buy. Will the UK sell its Bitcoin? A nation state may be about to sell its Bitcoin. If the Sunday Telegraph is to be believed, the UK Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is thinking of selling around $5 billion worth of $BTC in order to help shore up a nasty shortfall in public finances. It seems the UK will never learn. All of the trumpeting made by former Chancellor, and eventual Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, where he promised to make the UK a global hub for crypto, turned into an anti-crypto regime that not only made regulatory compliance extremely difficult for crypto businesses wishing to set up shop there, but also made life hell for UK citizens who wanted to purchase crypto. The UK does have a past history of incompetence relating to its asset holdings. Gordon Brown, UK Chancellor at the turn of the century, decided that it would be a good move to sell a large chunk of the UK’s gold. He announced the idea to the market, and said when he would sell. The market brought the price down as low as possible, bought all the gold, and then watched with satisfaction as gold increased around 700% over the next 10 years. $BTC breakout or fakeout? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for the $BTC price shows the breakout of the triangle. It can also be seen how the price has come back to either test the top of the triangle, and the $119,000 support/resistance, or it is about to fall back inside the triangle, signalling a fakeout. Very low breakout volume could support the latter outcome. Nevertheless, if $BTC is breaking out, what the price has done up to now is perfectly reasonable and to be expected. Bulls will be looking to take charge from now on in. As far as market manipulation goes, the sweep underneath the triangle and the support levels on Sunday would likely have taken out the stops of those going long. Perhaps a dip back into the triangle could also take out those stops yet again? No volume support for breakout Source: TradingView The daily chart shows the large amount of volatility around the current levels. However, the volume profile reveals the smallest of green bars so far. Certainly not a good signal to reinforce a breakout. The RSI at the bottom of the chart illustrates that the indicator line is angled back towards the top. That said, it will need to get above the previous high of 78.29 in order to nullify the bearish divergence that is still a threat in the background. Is a Bitcoin fall coming? Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BTC , seen through the eyes of a bear rather than a bull, could be suggesting that Robert Kiyosaki’s “bust” might indeed come to pass. The $119,000 resistance is proving a tough nut for the bulls to crack. In addition, the RSI reveals that the indicator line might just face a third rejection at the trendline if the current breakout does fail to materialise. The bearish divergence on this time frame is far more concerning than on the daily time frame, as price moves up while the RSI continues to trend down. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI has its indicators very near the top. Are they about to pivot and turn back down again? All of these factors are a worry for Bitcoin bulls. Nevertheless, if one zooms further out into the 2-week and the monthly charts, the bullishness does return. Therefore, could there be a short-term pullback, followed by a continuation of the bull run? This remains to be seen, and time will tell.

David Carvalho, CEO of post-quantum infrastructure firm Naoris Protocol and a former ethical hacker since age 13, claims that quantum computers could silently dismantle Bitcoin’s cryptographic foundations within years, not decades. His warning comes as governments and tech giants already implement “harvest now, decrypt later” strategies, collecting encrypted blockchain data today for future decryption by quantum computers. Today, approximately 30% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, roughly 6-7 million BTC , sits vulnerable in older address formats that expose public keys directly to potential quantum attacks. Understanding the Quantum Threat to Bitcoin’s Core Security Unlike traditional computers, which process information in binary bits of 0s and 1s, quantum computers utilize quantum bits, or “qubits,” that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a property called superposition. This quantum advantage allows these machines to perform calculations exponentially faster than classical computers for specific mathematical problems, particularly those involving large number factorization. Bitcoin’s security relies on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), specifically the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which creates a mathematical relationship between public and private keys. Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm used by Bitcoin (Source: Learn Me A Bitcoin ) Current computers would require billions of years to reverse-engineer a private key from its corresponding public key due to the computational complexity of solving the discrete logarithm problem underlying ECC. However, mathematician Peter Shor demonstrated in 1999 that quantum computers could solve these factorization problems exponentially faster using Shor’s algorithm . This breakthrough would render obsolete the one-way mathematical function that protects Bitcoin wallets, enabling quantum computers to derive private keys from exposed public keys. Carvalho believes this countdown has already begun because adversaries are systematically collecting encrypted blockchain data under the “harvest now, decrypt later” model. “The adversaries collecting encrypted blockchain data right now aren’t waiting to attack today,” Carvalho explained , “They’re building data sets for tomorrow.” Up to 30% of all Bitcoin in circulation could be at risk of theft when Q-Day arrives in three years, according to Naoris CEO David Carvalho. #BTC #QuantumComputing #Crypto https://t.co/nuaDec03hz — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 21, 2025 Bitcoin addresses fall into different vulnerability categories, with Pay-to-Public-Key (P2PK) formats directly exposing public keys and making them immediate targets for quantum attacks.

The latest news from the Swedish healthtech firm confirms a growing trend: the calculated integration of cryptocurrency into corporate treasury strategies. This recent Bitcoin acquisition by H100 Group isn’t just a financial transaction; it’s a clear signal of confidence in the future of decentralized finance and a testament to Bitcoin’s evolving role as a legitimate store of value. H100 Group’s Latest Bold Bitcoin Acquisition: What Does It Mean? H100 Group, a name typically associated with health technology, has once again made headlines in the crypto space. The company recently announced a substantial purchase of an additional 140.25 BTC. This significant Bitcoin acquisition was made at an average price of SEK 1,169,277 per BTC, demonstrating a clear commitment to expanding their digital asset holdings. This latest move brings H100 Group’s total Bitcoin reserves to an impressive 510.28 BTC.

The company’s consistent accumulation suggests a long-term vision for their digital asset strategy, positioning them uniquely within the healthtech sector. H100 Group’s strategic Bitcoin acquisition reflects a growing corporate trend towards digital assets. Bitcoin Acquisition: H100 Group Makes a Bold Move, Amassing Over 500 BTC Why Are More Companies Pursuing a Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets is gaining momentum, and for good reason. Companies are increasingly recognizing the unique advantages that digital assets offer in the current economic climate. Several key factors drive this growing interest: Inflation Hedge: With global inflation concerns on the rise, Bitcoin is often viewed as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to its finite supply. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Traditional treasury management often relies heavily on cash and short-term debt instruments. A Bitcoin acquisition offers a new avenue for diversification, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies an opportunity for capital appreciation. Innovation and Future-Proofing: Embracing digital assets positions companies at the forefront of financial innovation, signaling adaptability and a forward-looking approach to investors and customers. Attracting Talent and Investors: For some, holding Bitcoin can make a company more attractive to tech-savvy talent and investors who are bullish on the crypto space. What Are the Benefits of a Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition? Beyond the strategic rationale, the tangible benefits for companies undertaking a Bitcoin acquisition can be substantial. These benefits extend beyond mere financial gains, touching upon brand perception and operational flexibility. For one, holding Bitcoin can offer a compelling narrative of innovation. It signals that a company is not only financially astute but also open to embracing new technologies and paradigms. This can enhance a company’s image, making it appear more modern and resilient in the eyes of the public and potential partners. Furthermore, the liquidity of Bitcoin, despite its price fluctuations, ensures that it can be converted to fiat relatively quickly if needed, providing a flexible asset that can be deployed in various scenarios. Companies like H100 Group are also tapping into the potential for significant returns. While no investment is without risk, Bitcoin’s historical performance has shown periods of immense growth, which could substantially boost a company’s balance sheet over time. This speculative upside, combined with its utility as a censorship-resistant and globally transferable asset, makes it an attractive component of a diversified corporate treasury. Are There Challenges Associated with a Bitcoin Acquisition? While the allure of Bitcoin is strong, any significant Bitcoin acquisition comes with its own set of challenges that companies must carefully navigate. It’s not a decision to be taken lightly, and thorough due diligence is paramount. The primary concern is often Bitcoin’s price volatility.

2025-07-21 16:14:42+00:00,"Strategy Boosts Bitcoin Holdings With Additional 6,220 BTC","Strategy recently revealed it has acquired 6,220 Bitcoin units for about $739.8 million, at an average price of $118,940 per coin. This latest purchase was made between July 14 and July 20, according to its new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This latest move increases Strategy’s total holdings to 607,770 BTC, worth over $71 billion at current prices. It is worth noting that the Nasdaq-listed company spent about $43.61 billion, including fees, on its total holdings. BTC Treasury Reserve Serves as Strategy’s Growth Catalyst This milestone makes Strategy the ninth-largest holder of cash and cash equivalents among S&P 500 companies. Interestingly, this move reflects the firm’s ongoing commitment to utilizing Bitcoin as a key asset in its corporate treasury strategy. Meanwhile, from an investment viewpoint, Strategy’s average cost for Bitcoin is now lower than current market prices, showing significant unrealized gains. As such, the company’s buying strategy shows its role as a leader in adopting digital assets and indicates that more institutions are becoming confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Notably, the software intelligence firm said several shares were used to fund its latest Bitcoin purchase. This includes at-the-market shares, operating cash, and convertible note offerings. Strategy Inc’s Long-Term Bitcoin Plan Expands These share sales are part of the U.S.-based firm’s bold “42/42” capital plan, which aims to raise $84 billion for Bitcoin acquisitions by 2027. This is double the original target under the earlier “21/21” plan. To date, Strategy has raised billions by selling shares and convertible notes, with additional funds still available through its ongoing programs. Some analysts believe this premium is justified due to the company’s strong equity-to-Bitcoin cycle. Others, however, have raised concerns about a possible negative feedback loop from overdependence on Bitcoin valuations. A recent class action lawsuit also claims that Strategy misled investors about its Bitcoin strategy . Recall that the Michael Saylor-led company paused its Bitcoin purchases between June 30 and July 6. The pause in Bitcoin purchases comes as the firm shifted focus from selling common stock to offering perpetual stock to raise capital . Despite the pause, Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Metaplanet Learns From Strategy Bitcoin Playbook Another firm making giant strides with a growing Bitcoin accumulation strategy is Metaplanet. The Japanese financial leader launched this strategy about a year ago and has remained true to it. In the first week of July, it reported a purchase of 2,205 BTC, worth about $238.7 million at the time. As a result of the acquisition, Metaplanet’s total crypto holdings climbed to 15,555 BTC. As reported by TheCoinRise, the firm aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027, which is approximately 1% of the total supply. This Bitcoin strategy, which mirrors the company’s approach, has driven significant growth for Metaplanet.

This latest purchase was made between July 14 and July 20, according to its new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This latest move increases Strategy’s total holdings to 607,770 BTC, worth over $71 billion at current prices. It is worth noting that the Nasdaq-listed company spent about $43.61 billion, including fees, on its total holdings. BTC Treasury Reserve Serves as Strategy’s Growth Catalyst This milestone makes Strategy the ninth-largest holder of cash and cash equivalents among S&P 500 companies. Interestingly, this move reflects the firm’s ongoing commitment to utilizing Bitcoin as a key asset in its corporate treasury strategy. Meanwhile, from an investment viewpoint, Strategy’s average cost for Bitcoin is now lower than current market prices, showing significant unrealized gains. As such, the company’s buying strategy shows its role as a leader in adopting digital assets and indicates that more institutions are becoming confident in Bitcoin’s long-term value. Notably, the software intelligence firm said several shares were used to fund its latest Bitcoin purchase. This includes at-the-market shares, operating cash, and convertible note offerings. Strategy Inc’s Long-Term Bitcoin Plan Expands These share sales are part of the U.S.-based firm’s bold “42/42” capital plan, which aims to raise $84 billion for Bitcoin acquisitions by 2027. This is double the original target under the earlier “21/21” plan. To date, Strategy has raised billions by selling shares and convertible notes, with additional funds still available through its ongoing programs. Some analysts believe this premium is justified due to the company’s strong equity-to-Bitcoin cycle. Others, however, have raised concerns about a possible negative feedback loop from overdependence on Bitcoin valuations. A recent class action lawsuit also claims that Strategy misled investors about its Bitcoin strategy . Recall that the Michael Saylor-led company paused its Bitcoin purchases between June 30 and July 6. The pause in Bitcoin purchases comes as the firm shifted focus from selling common stock to offering perpetual stock to raise capital . Despite the pause, Strategy remains the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. Metaplanet Learns From Strategy Bitcoin Playbook Another firm making giant strides with a growing Bitcoin accumulation strategy is Metaplanet. The Japanese financial leader launched this strategy about a year ago and has remained true to it. In the first week of July, it reported a purchase of 2,205 BTC, worth about $238.7 million at the time. As a result of the acquisition, Metaplanet’s total crypto holdings climbed to 15,555 BTC. As reported by TheCoinRise, the firm aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027, which is approximately 1% of the total supply. This Bitcoin strategy, which mirrors the company’s approach, has driven significant growth for Metaplanet.

2025-07-21 16:25:18+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Fall: Unpacking the Sudden Drop Below $118,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Fall: Unpacking the Sudden Drop Below $118,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with the latest market tremor: Bitcoin has taken a significant tumble, breaching the crucial $118,000 mark. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at $117,994.81 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden Bitcoin price fall has certainly caught the attention of investors worldwide, prompting questions about market stability and future trajectories. For many, it’s a moment of concern; for others, a potential opportunity. Understanding the dynamics behind such movements is pivotal for anyone navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. What Triggered This Unanticipated Bitcoin Price Fall? When a major asset like Bitcoin experiences a rapid descent, the immediate question on everyone’s mind is: why? While pinpointing a single cause is often challenging due to the complex interplay of factors in the crypto market, several potential catalysts could contribute to a significant Bitcoin price fall . These often include a mix of macroeconomic trends, specific market events, and investor sentiment. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic indicators, such as rising inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, can often spill over into the crypto market. When traditional markets show signs of instability, investors might opt for less risky assets, leading to a sell-off in more speculative ones like Bitcoin. Regulatory Scrutiny: News or rumors of increased regulatory oversight, bans, or unfavorable policy changes in major jurisdictions can induce panic selling. Uncertainty around how governments will regulate cryptocurrencies often casts a shadow over the market. Large-Scale Liquidations or Whale Movements: Significant sell orders from large holders (often termed ‘whales’) or cascades of liquidations in the derivatives market can trigger a rapid price decline. When leveraged positions are forced to close, it can create a domino effect, exacerbating the downward pressure. Technical Resistance and Support Breakdowns: From a technical analysis perspective, breaking below key support levels can signal further declines. The $118,000 mark might have been a crucial psychological or technical support level, and its breach could have triggered automated sell orders. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant gains, some investors may decide to lock in profits, especially if they perceive the market to be overheated. Coordinated or widespread profit-taking can contribute to a notable Bitcoin price fall . A Closer Look at BTC’s Volatility: Is This Bitcoin Price Fall Normal? Bitcoin has always been synonymous with volatility. Its journey from obscurity to a global financial asset has been marked by dramatic peaks and valleys. This recent Bitcoin price fall , while significant, is not an isolated incident in its history. Understanding this historical context is crucial for maintaining perspective and making informed decisions. Bitcoin’s inherent volatility stems from several factors: Market Immaturity: Compared to traditional financial markets, the crypto market is still relatively young and less liquid, making it more susceptible to large price swings from significant buy or sell orders. Speculative Nature: A substantial portion of crypto investment is driven by speculation, leading to rapid price movements based on news, social media trends, or even rumors. Limited Supply and Demand Dynamics: Bitcoin’s fixed supply and fluctuating demand can create sharp price adjustments. To put this current event into perspective, let’s consider some hypothetical scenarios of past market movements: Period Market Event Approximate Price Action Early 2021 Correction after parabolic run ~30% drop from peak Mid-2022 Macroeconomic concerns, major crypto project collapse ~70% drop from ATH Today BTC drops below $118,000 Trading at $117,994.81 These examples illustrate that significant corrections and periods of a Bitcoin price fall are part of its market cycle. While the current drop below $118,000 is noteworthy, it fits within Bitcoin’s historical pattern of volatility. What Does This Bitcoin Price Fall Mean for Investors? A sudden market downturn, especially a pronounced Bitcoin price fall , can evoke a range of emotions among investors, from fear and anxiety to excitement for potential buying opportunities. How you react to such events often dictates the long-term health of your portfolio. Navigating the Emotional Rollercoaster: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD): The immediate aftermath of a price drop often sees a surge in negative sentiment.

2025-07-21 16:30:22+00:00,Bitcoin Indicator Signals Buying Bias: Analyst Warns ‘Bulls Lack Aggression’,"Bitcoin is facing a pivotal moment as it hovers just below the $123,000 all-time high. While bulls remain in control, price action has stalled beneath this key resistance, exposing a lack of decisive momentum. After a strong 20% rally since late June, the market now waits for a breakout confirmation to extend the uptrend. Sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish, driven by increased adoption, legal clarity in the US, and favorable macroeconomic developments. However, recent on-chain and exchange data show a noticeable decline in spot buying pressure. This divergence between sentiment and real demand suggests that bulls may be hesitating to enter at current levels, possibly due to expectations of a correction or profit-taking near the highs. The price structure remains bullish as long as BTC holds above the $115K support zone, but the inability to break $123K raises concerns about a possible short-term reversal or continued sideways action. For now, Bitcoin’s trend remains intact, but a clear surge in volume and buying activity will be required to reclaim new highs and maintain bullish momentum. Bitcoin Sentiment Stays Bullish, But Buying Pressure Fades Top crypto analyst Axel Adler recently shared an update on the Bitcoin Advanced Sentiment Index, offering key insights into the current market psychology. According to Adler, the index currently reads 64%, signaling that sentiment remains solidly bullish. However, he noted a critical caveat: while the market leans toward buying, bulls appear to lack the aggression needed to push Bitcoin decisively above its all-time high of $123,000. This hesitation is consistent with what’s unfolding in the charts. After a sharp rally of over 20% since late June, Bitcoin is now consolidating in a tight range between $115K and $120K. While this structure suggests strength, the lack of follow-through buying at higher levels reflects caution among investors. It appears that market participants are waiting for a clear catalyst before positioning more aggressively. The current compression in price action could precede a large move, as periods of low volatility at elevated levels often do. Traders should prepare for a breakout in either direction. While the overall trend and sentiment favor upside continuation, the possibility of a correction remains in play, particularly if sentiment begins to fade or macro conditions shift unexpectedly. BTC Consolidates Near All-Time Highs The daily chart shows Bitcoin consolidating just below its all-time high of $123,000, trading at $118,636 at the time of writing. The recent price action suggests strong bullish control, but the lack of a decisive breakout above the $122,077 resistance has introduced short-term uncertainty. The structure remains clearly bullish, with BTC forming higher highs and higher lows since the rebound from the March lows near $97,000. Notably, Bitcoin is holding well above the 50-day ($109,225), 100-day ($103,913), and 200-day ($97,949) moving averages. These levels now serve as layered support, reinforcing the long-term bullish trend. The ongoing consolidation above $115,724 suggests that bulls are defending this zone with conviction. However, volume has not followed through as strongly during this consolidation phase, a sign that some market participants are waiting for confirmation before committing new capital. If BTC breaks above $122,077 with strong volume, it could trigger a breakout and price discovery toward higher levels. On the flip side, a break below $115,724 could lead to a deeper retracement toward the 50-day MA.

2025-07-21 16:45:18+00:00,Asia Is Powering Ethereum’s Weekend Gains Amidst Signals of Altseason Breakout,"Ethereum climbed above $3,800 after recording a daily gain of nearly 3%. It extended a strong upward trend that has seen the altcoin rise over 55% in the past month. This momentum highlighted continued investor confidence, despite relatively low gas fees across the network. Funding rates have moved into double digits, although they remain modest relative to the broader scale of futures positioning and Ethereum ETF inflows. Against this backdrop, Asia continues to lead altcoin performance in ETH. Asia’s ETH Buying Spree Matrixport revealed that data tracking ETH’s performance across trading sessions last week showed Asia’s influence becoming more pronounced, which is responsible for the sharp weekend rally. Beyond speculative flows and treasury adoption, an uptick in DeFi activity is also providing much-needed support to the cryptocurrency’s upward momentum. Amid this supportive environment, experts highlighted the emerging signals that point towards a potential altcoin season taking shape. For instance, the associated indexes have crossed above 50, the highest since December. ETH Perpetual Open Interest surged from under $18 billion to over $28 billion in a week, which is being driven by institutional demand. The recently signed GENIUS Act, which sets clearer stablecoin regulations, has also renewed interest in ETH and other Layer 1s among Corporate Treasuries. Meanwhile, the anticipation of staked spot ETH ETF approvals is prompting further institutional rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum. ETH’s market share has risen to 11.6% while BTC dominance slips, which could mean that a potential next leg for altcoin season is underway. Critical Resistance Point for Altcoins A similar sentiment was echoed by Swissblock’s data, which shows that 75% of altcoins are currently testing key resistance levels, a technical point where altcoin seasons either begin or fail. In weak altseasons, Bitcoin remains strong, which leads to only short-lived altcoin rallies with limited capital rotation into alts. On the other hand, strong altseasons require significant capital flow. This is characterized by Bitcoin losing relative strength, its dominance dropping, and altcoins breaking out broadly across the market. Swissblock noted that the market is at this decision point now. Bitcoin’s momentum is slowing, and early signs of capital rotation into altcoins have begun, which means the conditions for a potential strong altseason are forming if capital flow accelerates further.

2025-07-21 16:47:19+00:00,XRP Price Prediction: XRP Positioned for Trillions in Global Liquidity – Can XRP Overtake Bitcoin?,"XRP (XRP) seems poised to retest this year’s latest high once again and could soon make a new all-time high after President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act. This new piece of legislation favors a bullish XRP price prediction as it brings clarity to an important sector of the crypto industry in the United States – the stablecoins market. XRP has exploded in the past 7 days with gains of 18.5% and has delivered a 70.8% return since the year started. https://t.co/T8eBIqzFRd — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) July 18, 2025 Analyst Versan Aljarrah from Black Swan Capitalist believes that this could just be the beginning of the token’s rally as institutions are eyeing the Ripple network as the potential infrastructure for the launch of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He thinks that Ripple is a feasible substitute for the outdated cross-border payments system SWIFT and emphasized that the company has been making progress across the globe to establish itself as a leading force in this market. As a result, the demand for XRP should skyrocket if central banks decide to use its network to officially launch CBDCs. His most insightful take – central banks are already testing Ripple’s infrastructure for this purpose via the CBDC Ripple Private Ledger . XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Hit $4 In a Few Days After Bullish Breakout The daily chart shows that XRP has broken through a key resistance at $3.4 and has already successfully retested and bounced off that level. This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as market participants eagerly bought the token during the retest to position themselves for the token’s next leg up. On July 17 and 18, volumes neared the $20 billion mark, which evidences strong accumulation after the breakout occurred. Everything points to an upcoming push above XRP’s all-time high of $3.84 in the next few days. The most plausible target at this point would be the $4 psychological threshold. Can XRP overtake Bitcoin as the most valuable crypto in the world? For that to happen, the token would have to rise to nearly $40 and BTC would have to stand still as that happens. This is highly unlikely. However, the upside potential that XRP currently offers both from a technical and macro standpoint is quite appealing. Meanwhile, the best crypto presales of the year like TOKEN6900 ($T6900) could deliver even higher gains as investors chase the next crypto to 10x. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) Redefines Meme Coins with Pure Degeneracy and 2000s Vibes Tired of analyzing charts, sniping meme coins, and getting rug-pulled by scammers? TOKEN6900 ($T6900) is your way out of your mom’s basement. This is a new meme coin that leverages the success of its predecessor, SPX6900 (SPX) by combining peak financial ‘brain rot’ with a touch of 2000s nostalgia. This token offers no road map, has no use case, and it is entirely worthless by itself – which is everything that meme coins should be. However, through the power of community, it can soon become one of the most valuable assets in this category. Take a stand and believe in something. Head to the TOKEN6900 website to invest. Simply connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ) and either swap USDT or ETH or use your bank card to complete your purchase.

XRP (XRP) seems poised to retest this year’s latest high once again and could soon make a new all-time high after President Donald Trump signed the Genius Act. This new piece of legislation favors a bullish XRP price prediction as it brings clarity to an important sector of the crypto industry in the United States – the stablecoins market. XRP has exploded in the past 7 days with gains of 18.5% and has delivered a 70.8% return since the year started. https://t.co/T8eBIqzFRd — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) July 18, 2025 Analyst Versan Aljarrah from Black Swan Capitalist believes that this could just be the beginning of the token’s rally as institutions are eyeing the Ripple network as the potential infrastructure for the launch of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). He thinks that Ripple is a feasible substitute for the outdated cross-border payments system SWIFT and emphasized that the company has been making progress across the globe to establish itself as a leading force in this market. As a result, the demand for XRP should skyrocket if central banks decide to use its network to officially launch CBDCs. His most insightful take – central banks are already testing Ripple’s infrastructure for this purpose via the CBDC Ripple Private Ledger . XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Hit $4 In a Few Days After Bullish Breakout The daily chart shows that XRP has broken through a key resistance at $3.4 and has already successfully retested and bounced off that level. This favors a bullish XRP price prediction as market participants eagerly bought the token during the retest to position themselves for the token’s next leg up. On July 17 and 18, volumes neared the $20 billion mark, which evidences strong accumulation after the breakout occurred.

In a new press release , the DOJ says it’s charging 48-year-old Christine Hunsicker of New Jersey – the CEO and founder of clothing tech firm CaaStle – with numerous crimes after she allegedly forged documents to make it appear as if the firm was financially healthy. Authorities say that Hunsicker knew that CaaStle was in financial distress “with limited cash and significant expenses.” However, to raise more funds to operate the company, she allegedly fabricated income statements, bank records, and other documents as a means of tricking investors into thinking the firm was profitable and had cash on hand. According to the DOJ, Hunsicker raked in a staggering $275 million for CaaStle. Some of her alleged fraudulent activities include providing an investor with fake bank account screenshots showing the company had $200 million in cash when in reality it had 1,000x less. She also allegedly falsified the signature of a board director to make it appear that the firm’s board had authorized the grant of stock options, allowing her to raise another $20 million. Authorities also allege that Hunsicker defrauded investors of a new business venture, P180, getting them to invest $30 million by using fake information about CaaStle’s success. All in all, Hunsicker allegedly raised more than $300 from fraudulent practices. As stated by US Attorney Jay Clayton, “As alleged, Christine Hunsicker defrauded investors of hundreds of millions of dollars through document forgery, fabricated audits, and material misrepresentations about her company’s financial condition. The promise of pre-IPO (initial public offering) technology companies can be fertile ground for fraudsters who play on investor euphoria. Investors should be aware of these incentives and that pre-IPO companies are not subject to the rigors of SEC registration.” Hunsicker is charged with aggravated identity theft, wire fraud, securities fraud, money laundering, and making false statements to a financial institution.

2025-07-21 16:56:11+00:00,Expert sets timeline when quantum computers will ‘rip Bitcoin to  shreds’,"A cybersecurity expert has warned that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) underlying security could be compromised in the coming years by quantum computers, amid ongoing advancements in the sector. According to David Carvalho, CEO and Chief Scientist at Naoris Protocol, Bitcoin is vulnerable due to its reliance on elliptic-curve cryptography. To this end, he projected that it could take just three to five years for quantum computers to crack this security, he said in an interview with Crypto News. He explained that emerging quantum algorithms, especially Shor’s algorithm, will be able to break Bitcoin’s cryptographic protections in seconds once sufficiently powerful quantum computers are available. Carvalho cautioned that about 30% of Bitcoin, or 6 to 7 million BTC, is stored in addresses that expose public keys, making them prime targets for quantum attacks. “Blockchains are based on elliptic-curve signatures, which Shor’s algorithm will rip to shreds in seconds once you have a quantum computer. Every on-chain public key that is ever shown on the blockchain will forever be a target. All together, this points to a window of three to five years — possibly even shorter — before quantum can regularly defeat today’s elliptic-curve or RSA-based cryptography,” he said. Fast approaching Q-Day The expert further warned that “Q-Day” is approaching, citing breakthroughs such as Microsoft’s Majorana chip and Google’s forecast for quantum machines capable of breaking RSA-2048 encryption in the near term. With around 100 quantum systems already operational, and McKinsey projecting 5,000 by 2030, Carvalho urged investors to act now by transferring assets to quantum-safe wallets, updating software, and using quantum-secure custodians. Indeed, concerns over Bitcoin’s vulnerability to quantum computing have accelerated in 2025 following multiple breakthroughs. Among them is IBM’s (NYSE: IBM ) plan to launch the first fault-tolerant quantum computer, Quantum Starling, by 2029, a major leap from today’s error-prone models. However, experts remain divided on how Bitcoin will ultimately be affected once the technology is fully implemented. For instance, Adam Back, an early Bitcoin adopter and CEO of Blockstream, has noted that quantum computers are unlikely to threaten Bitcoin for at least 20 years. However, he noted future breakthroughs might require users, possibly even Satoshi Nakamoto, to move funds to quantum-resistant addresses.

2025-07-21 17:57:23+00:00,Solana price prediction 2025-2031: Trends and insights for investors,"Key takeaways Solana’s price can reach a maximum of $323.40 and an average trading value of $291.75 in 2025. By 2028, SOL is expected to reach a new high of $666.41, driven by mainstream adoption of its dApps. Solana’s price could surpass the $1,000 mark, potentially reaching $1,543.45 or higher by 2031. Despite occasional challenges for Solana ecosystem, including network congestion and competition from other blockchain platforms, the current sentiment shows that Solana demonstrates resilience and adaptability, despite the current price fluctuations, positioning itself as a leading player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 landscape. Overall, the prevailing sentiment within the Solana community reflects the current sentiment of confidence and excitement among investors , driven by the growing interest in Solana with stakeholders eagerly anticipating the platform’s continued evolution and impact on the broader crypto ecosystem. While uncertainties persist, Solana’s innovative approach and robust infrastructure instill optimism for its future price trajectory, as indicated by the technical analysis, solana price forecast and market dominance, particularly when evaluated against momentum indicators. How high can SOL go in 2025 and beyond? Overview Cryptocurrency Solana Token SOL Price $196. (+7.21%) Market Cap $105.45 Billion Trading Volume 24-hour $10.73 Billion Circulating Supply 538.04 Million SOL All-time High $294.33 Jan 19, 2025 All-time Low $0.5052, May 11, 2020 24-hour High $198.92 24-hour Low $178.44 Solana price prediction: Technical analysis Sentiment Bullish 50-Day SMA $153.91 200-Day SMA $163.72 Price Prediction $428.53 (118.42%) F & G Index 34.79 (fear) Green Days 16/30 (54%) 14-Day RSI 83.82 Solana price analysis: SOL soars to $200 as bulls aim for $240 TL;DR Breakdown: Solana price analysis shows a bullish recovery to $200. Resistance for SOL is at $200. Support for SOL/USD is at $180. The price analysis of Solana for July 21 shows that SOL has risen to challenge the $200 price level as bulls seeks to go higher. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL rises to $200 Solana showed significant bearish pressure on the daily chart around the $180 price level that it found hard to cross. However, after a brief respite, the bulls broke through the level and soared to the $200 price level where they challenge the key $200 resistance as short to mid term technicals suggest a hike towards the $240 price. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 79.50, showing little to no room for further upwards movement across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line rises slowly, suggesting rising bearish pressure. However, the MACD histogram shows rising bullish pressure in the cryptocurrency market as SOL rises back to $200. SOL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bullish momentum halts at $200 The 4-hour chart for Solana reveals a steady rise as the bulls aim to rise past the $200 price level. The chart shows consolidation around $176 before past the $180 level. The high trading volume has caused high volatility in the last few days the price has again risen back to $200 but struggles to cross past. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at 1.43, with the indicator showing rising bullish momentum with recent candles. This suggests that the bulls are yet to find a foothold at the level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) rose to 82.11, indicating that Solana has no room for further movement in the upwards direction across the short term and SOL needs to hold steady above the $185 level. Solana technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 155.79 BUY SMA 5 $ 167.79 BUY SMA 10 $ 166.90 BUY SMA 21 $ 159.80 BUY SMA 50 $ 155.23 BUY SMA 100 $ 156.32 BUY SMA 200 $ 152.04 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 160.24 BUY EMA 5 $ 157.13 BUY EMA 10 $ 151.23 BUY EMA 21 $ 143.54 BUY EMA 50 $ 145.47 BUY EMA 100 $ 159.07 BUY EMA 200 $ 167.48 BUY What to expect from Solana price analysis? SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 4-hour charts indicates overstretched bulls as the price seeks to go above $200. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $190, SOL can be expected to fall to $185, a key level that needs to be defended for the bullish rally to continue towards $240. However, if the price falls below the $185 level, SOL may fall to the $174 mark. Is SOL a good investment?

Resistance for SOL is at $200. Support for SOL/USD is at $180. The price analysis of Solana for July 21 shows that SOL has risen to challenge the $200 price level as bulls seeks to go higher. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL rises to $200 Solana showed significant bearish pressure on the daily chart around the $180 price level that it found hard to cross. However, after a brief respite, the bulls broke through the level and soared to the $200 price level where they challenge the key $200 resistance as short to mid term technicals suggest a hike towards the $240 price. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 79.50, showing little to no room for further upwards movement across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line rises slowly, suggesting rising bearish pressure. However, the MACD histogram shows rising bullish pressure in the cryptocurrency market as SOL rises back to $200.

The chart shows consolidation around $176 before past the $180 level. The high trading volume has caused high volatility in the last few days the price has again risen back to $200 but struggles to cross past. SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview From a technical perspective, the MACD shows rising bearish momentum at 1.43, with the indicator showing rising bullish momentum with recent candles. This suggests that the bulls are yet to find a foothold at the level. The RSI (Relative Strength Index) rose to 82.11, indicating that Solana has no room for further movement in the upwards direction across the short term and SOL needs to hold steady above the $185 level. Solana technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 155.79 BUY SMA 5 $ 167.79 BUY SMA 10 $ 166.90 BUY SMA 21 $ 159.80 BUY SMA 50 $ 155.23 BUY SMA 100 $ 156.32 BUY SMA 200 $ 152.04 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 160.24 BUY EMA 5 $ 157.13 BUY EMA 10 $ 151.23 BUY EMA 21 $ 143.54 BUY EMA 50 $ 145.47 BUY EMA 100 $ 159.07 BUY EMA 200 $ 167.48 BUY What to expect from Solana price analysis? SOL/USDT chart by Tradingview The Solana price analysis across the daily and 4-hour charts indicates overstretched bulls as the price seeks to go above $200. The chart suggests a correction before the bulls can continue upwards. As the price falls back towards $190, SOL can be expected to fall to $185, a key level that needs to be defended for the bullish rally to continue towards $240. However, if the price falls below the $185 level, SOL may fall to the $174 mark. Is SOL a good investment?

2025-07-21 18:27:33+00:00,Here’s How Much XRP Available for Business Operation,"Software engineer Vincent Van Code published a detailed breakdown on Twitter addressing what he describes as a widespread misconception surrounding the total XRP supply. While XRP is often cited as having a 100 billion token maximum supply, Van Code emphasizes that the figure does not reflect the volume truly accessible for business operations such as payments, cross-border settlement, or liquidity provision. In the tweet, Van Code systematically reviews various categories of XRP holdings and exclusions to establish a more accurate estimate of XRP realistically available for real-world financial applications. He identifies substantial constraints that significantly reduce the actual liquid supply from the total minted amount. How Much XRP Is Actually Available for Business Use? Everyone talks about “100 billion XRP” — but how much is truly liquid and usable for payments, liquidity, or cross-border settlements? Let’s break it down. The number may shock you. — 1. Total XRP Supply = 100B But… — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) July 19, 2025 Ripple’s Escrow Holdings and the Predictable Lockup Mechanism Van Code first highlights Ripple’s escrow management , which currently accounts for approximately 40 billion XRP. These tokens are released in fixed increments of 1 billion XRP per month, but according to Van Code, most of the released XRP is typically returned to escrow. He estimates that, on average, about 800 million XRP is re-escrowed monthly. Despite the predictable schedule of escrow releases, he maintains that this XRP is not practically liquid and therefore unsuitable for immediate use in fast-moving markets or real-time liquidity provisioning. Lost XRP and Dormant Wallets The tweet also examines the volume of XRP that may be permanently inaccessible. Drawing a parallel with Bitcoin, Van Code suggests that between 5 and 8 billion XRP is likely lost due to forgotten private keys, abandoned wallets, and early-user inaccessibility. This segment, while not officially removed from the circulating supply, no longer plays an active role in the ecosystem. He equates this to roughly 5–8% of the total XRP ever created. Institutional and Whale Accounts Another component examined is the large amount of XRP held by institutions and early stakeholders, including Ripple founders, exchanges, and venture capital firms. These wallets, estimated to hold between 20 and 25 billion XRP, are characterized by low transaction activity. Van Code points out that many of these holders treat their XRP similarly to how investors treat long-term stores of value, preferring to hold rather than engage in frequent trading or liquidity services. He categorizes these as effectively soft-locked due to behavioral patterns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple-Owned XRP Outside Escrow and DeFi Constraints Van Code identifies an additional 6 to 8 billion XRP held by Ripple outside the formal escrow structure. These holdings are reportedly used for strategic purposes such as acquisitions, incentives, or partnerships. Because these tokens are not consistently on the market, they are also excluded from his estimate of liquid supply. He then addresses emerging trends such as decentralized finance on the XRP Ledger. With the recent introduction of the XRPL Automated Market Maker (AMM), XRP is beginning to be locked in liquidity pools. While this segment is still developing, Van Code notes that DeFi mechanisms represent another constraining factor on accessible supply. Final Estimate of Liquid XRP and Market Implications Taking all these segments into account, Van Code concludes that only approximately 12 to 15 billion XRP is realistically available for open market use and business-related liquidity. This equates to just 12–15% of the full 100 billion XRP supply. He refers to this as the “estimated liquid supply,” which excludes escrowed, lost, institutional, and strategic holdings. Van Code concludes his tweet by pointing to potential market implications. He argues that if usage of XRP continues to expand through mechanisms such as On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) bridges, and tokenized asset transactions, then the already limited liquid supply may be increasingly insufficient to meet demand. In his assessment, as more XRP is locked away or treated as a long-term asset, supply constraints could exert upward pressure on the asset’s price. This analysis offers a distinct perspective on XRP’s supply dynamics. It may inform considerations for investors, enterprises, and liquidity providers evaluating the utility and valuation of the token within the broader digital asset economy.

Mutuum Finance’s 5th round presale has already sold over 80%. It is priced at $0.03 in this phase and its price will rise by 16.67% in the next phase. The money raised so far is over $12.7 million with over, 13700 unique token holders. With institutional capital circling Bitcoin and retail investors hunting for the next breakout, Mutuum Finance may be the story to watch in the next wave of decentralized finance innovation. Bitcoin Eyes $200K on Institutional Surge, Regulatory Momentum Bitcoin is already trading at around a price of almost 118,416, slightly below the recent high of around 119,548. This asset has been going through a consolidation phase after briefly surging beyond $123,000 on news of pro-crypto legislation in Washington. Momentous inflows to spot Bitcoin ETFs, exceeding $15 billion to date, and an increase in allocations by corporate treasuries are indicators of heightened confidence by institutional investors which have been driving the rally. Bitwise analysts and Bernstein recommend that structural backing, and supply-related restraints of mining, as well as the dynamic of looming halving in the future, may drive BTC to the $200,000 level in the late 2025s. With Bitcoin gaining a sound foothold on the macro-level, backed by legal certainty and large-pocket financiers, it establishes a platform towards a faster expansion of parallel crypto sectors. Mutuum Finance is in the position to be a part of that emerging story. Mutuum Pioneers Its Next-Generation Dual-Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a dual lending platform that caters for active as well as passive DeFi users. Passive income can be generated by users lending their USDT through stable passive income-generating smart contract pools providing stable passive income in the project’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system. Besides that, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model enables lenders and borrowers to exchange as much as they prefer since there is no middle party required. This is usually prevalent with customers of less stable assets like meme coins. Investor Sentiment Continues to Support Mutuum Presale More than $12.7 million has been invested and over 13700 investors have already invested in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as presale 5 rockets. This shows investor confidence in the project in the early stages is increasing. MUTM is priced at $0.03 before a 16.67% increase in phase 6.

Mutuum Finance has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty. It will be rewarded on a four-level severity scale: critical, major, minor and low. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Launches $100,000 Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance welcomes its new investors and has launched a $100,000 giveaway that will reward 10 lucky winners with $10,000 MUTM as an appreciation for the investors’ first-time faith in the project.

In a new interview with CNBC, the Fundstrat head of research was asked what levels he thinks BTC can reach over the next few months by the end of the year. “I think the $200,000 to $250,000 range for Bitcoin still makes sense, because that would still only value it at 25% of the size of the gold market. So I think digital gold means Bitcoin should be worth over a million dollars per Bitcoin. That could happen in the next few years, but maybe pricing in 25% of that – especially with the Genius Act – makes sense.” Bitcoin is worth $118,096 at time of writing. When asked about the burgeoning stablecoin market, Lee says there is more institutional acceptance happening in the sector. Given much of stablecoins’ reliance on the Ethereum network, Lee says the rise of the sector will likely provide a boost for ETH . “I mean, stablecoins are the ChatGPT moment for crypto, because businesses like it and consumers are adopting them.

CoinDCX co-founder and CEO Sumit Gupta later confirmed the unauthorized withdrawals in a post on the social media platform X. “Today, one of our internal operational accounts – used only for liquidity provisioning on a partner exchange – was compromised due to a sophisticated server breach.” Gupta says the company quickly contained the incident and clarified that the wallets used to store customer assets are not affected and are completely safe. He says CoinDCX is also working to patch vulnerabilities, trace the movement of the funds, as well as block and recover the stolen assets. “Since our operational accounts are segregated from customer wallets, the exposure is only limited to this specific account and is being fully absorbed by us – from our own treasury reserves.” However, ZachXBT says the exchange took much too long to disclose the incident, alleging that CoinDCX waited 17 hours to announce the hack, and may be trying to hype up the exchange on social media.

2025-07-21 19:00:29+00:00,XRP Proponent Says the Biggest Pump of Human Civilization Is Just Starting,"In a fiery and impassioned video shared on X, renowned cryptocurrency proponent Crypto Bitlord declared that the rally currently unfolding is “the biggest pump of human civilization.” His message, laced with humor, intensity, and unwavering conviction, captures the euphoric sentiment gripping the XRP community as the digital asset climbs to multi-year highs. “This is it. It’s just starting now . Brace yourself,” Bitlord said, urging his followers to abandon conventional logic and embrace the primal mindset of “apes” to survive the emotional rollercoaster of the current market. He warned that anyone unprepared mentally will panic and sell as XRP’s price rises to unimaginable heights. “If something’s not right in your head, you’re gonna sell,” he said. “Take yourself back to the land of apes… You need to be one of those things to survive this market.” This is the biggest pump of human civilization. It’s the end-game. And you’re holding greatness. It’s just starting so brace yourself pic.twitter.com/ORcEJEpTSE — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) July 20, 2025 XRP’s Price and Market Cap Surge As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.62, reflecting a 3.4% increase in the last 24 hours. The asset’s market capitalization has surged to approximately $212 billion, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP’s 24-hour trading volume remains strong, exceeding $9.6 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This rally represents more than just retail excitement. XRP’s rise has been driven by increasing institutional interest, regulatory clarity, and its growing utility in cross-border transactions. The token is also benefiting from favorable macroeconomic trends and increased liquidity across major exchanges. Bitlord’s Message: Beyond Islands, Into the Solar System Crypto Bitlord’s monologue wasn’t merely about price. It was a metaphor-laced rallying cry. “I’m not selling a f***ing cent, mate,” he exclaimed. “When it’s time, I’m only buying tickets to Pluto. Don’t worry about islands—I’m after the solar system.” His message reflects the belief held by many XRP proponents: that this current surge is not just a market cycle, but a historic turning point. Bitlord warns that bearish thinking will have no place in this new era. “If I see you talking about being bearish, I’m blocking you, deleting you, removing you from my life,” he said, emphasizing the need for mental resilience and total commitment. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hype Meets Caution While Bitlord’s passionate declaration embodies the excitement of the moment, analysts continue to advise caution. XRP’s parabolic moves, while impressive, also raise the risk of sharp pullbacks. Sudden profit-taking, especially among short-term traders, could trigger significant volatility. Historically, crypto markets have seen emotional highs followed by steep corrections, especially when sentiment becomes overheated. Still, many believe XRP is in the early stages of a much larger breakout. On-chain data shows growing accumulation among whales, and technical indicators suggest the asset is holding firmly above key support levels. If momentum continues, analysts are eyeing short-term targets above $4, with longer-term projections reaching as high as $10 under optimal conditions. Final Thoughts Crypto Bitlord’s viral commentary has struck a chord with the XRP community. Whether his vision of interplanetary wealth is taken literally or symbolically, it underscores the optimism surrounding XRP’s current rally. With the token now trading at $3.62 and its market cap above $212 billion, XRP is firmly in breakout territory. For now, as Bitlord puts it, “It’s just getting going. It’s just kicking off.” Whether you’re on the rocket or still watching from the launchpad, the XRP market is one to watch closely, and perhaps a bit like an ape.

2025-07-21 19:09:49+00:00,Block: Let It Ride On S&P Inclusion?,"Summary Block, Inc. stock surged over 46% since my initial Buy call, fueled by S&P 500 inclusion and receding Ark Invest sell pressure. Despite 9% YoY gross profit growth, Block faces slowing growth trends and margin compression in key segments, raising concerns about future profitability. Stablecoins present a credible long-term threat to Block’s core business, though current disruption remains limited to DeFi rather than mainstream payments. After the recent rally and valuation expansion, I’m downgrading XYZ stock to Hold—I’ve trimmed my position but still see some upside from index inclusion. It has been a little over three months since I last wrote about Block, Inc. ( XYZ ) for Seeking Alpha. At that time, I initiated coverage with a Buy rating predicated mainly on two ideas. First, sell pressure from Ark Invest was approaching maturity after the asset manager had sold off most of its holdings. Second, multiple compression had brought shares down to a modest price to earnings ratio. It took a few weeks for the stock to find its footing, but the performance of XYZ since that post has been quite good: Data by YCharts Since my initial coverage of XYZ, the stock has rallied by over 46% against an index (SPY) that - while also impressive - is up just 20% in three months. In this article, I''ll provide an updated take on XYZ given the recent rally in the stock. Major Catalyst: S&P 500 Inclusion The price of XYZ jumped by about 10% in post-market trading on the news that the stock will replace Hess (NYSE: HES ) in the S&P 500 (SP500) on July 23rd. As of July 21st intraday, the stock has indeed held most of that gain and is up by more than 8% as of article submission. The reason why S&P 500 inclusion is generally viewed as such a bullish catalyst for a stock is because index-tracking funds like ETFs will buy the stock to be properly weighted to the index. While this doesn''t diminish the need for the company to continue executing fundamentally, we have seen index-inclusion greatly enhance the returns of some stocks in the past. Notable examples of stocks that have rallied significantly following S&P 500 inclusion would be Tesla ( TSLA ) and Palantir ( PLTR ); each of which are currently among the top 25 stocks in the world by market capitalization. I don''t think we''ll see XYZ exhibit the same type of performance for a couple reasons; slowing growth and potential stablecoin disruption. Q1 25 For the quarter ended March 2025, Block reported top line revenue of $5.8 billion. This was a 3% decline from the prior year period and almost entirely attributed to a 15% year-over-year decline in the company''s Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) revenue segment. On the surface, this might be concerning, but Bitcoin has historically been Block''s least profitable business with meaningful revenue generation: Revenue (000s) Q1-25 Q1-24 YoY Transaction-based $1,550,731 $1,511,209 2.62% Subscription and Services $1,890,973 $1,682,294 12.40% Hardware $28,690 $32,501 -11.73% Bitcoin $2,301,402 $2,731,124 -15.73% Total $5,771,796 $5,957,128 -3.11% Source: Block Inc, 10-Q. Transaction revenue increased by 2.6% year-over-year and subscription/service revenue grew by 12.4%. Perhaps more importantly, the company''s gross profit of $2.3 billion was a 9% increase year-over-year.

Subscriptions/services margins continue to be impressive and grew almost 2% year-over-year from 84% to 85.5%. That segment currently accounts for 70% of Block''s gross profit. The question is, will Block''s transaction and subscription segments erode over time as merchants look to cheaper alternatives? Stablecoins Are Disruptive To Block''s Primary Profit-Makers With the recent signing of the GENIUS Act in the United States, the green light to innovation in the country has effectively been given. Stablecoin Market Cap (DeFi Llama) The market capitalization for stablecoins globally has surged passed $261 billion. The recent ramp in stablecoin supply is very much a result of President Donald Trump''s election victory in November with a 50% surge in supply since election day. The President ran on regulatory clarity and acceptance of digital assets during his campaign. With his signing of the GENIUS Act, he has largely delivered on that campaign promise from where I sit.

2025-07-21 19:14:44+00:00,The Node: Altcoin Season?,"BTC has been putting on a bit of a one-man show for the last couple of years, rising all the way to $120k while other major cryptocurrencies like ETH and SOL are still below their 2021 records. The orange coin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization steadily increased from a little under 40% in December of 2022 to 65% this June. But altcoins finally took a stand this July, with bitcoin dominance sliding 5.8% in a single week, its sharpest drop since June 2022. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk''s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here . A quick look over at CoinGecko shows us that a majority of the coins in the Top 100 have risen between 20% to 30% in the past seven days. ETH, which has had a rough two years , outperformed most of the market by notching 26% gains. DOGE , XRP and ADA — the usual suspects in times of elation — are up 40%, 22% and 23% respectively. Meanwhile, SOL finally caught up today by increasing 7%; the coin’s price is now 18% higher than last Monday. “It''s not surprising to see bitcoin dominance fall over the last month given progress around digital asset legislation in the U.S. and the continued emergence of altcoin treasury companies,” Brian Rudick, chief strategy officer at SOL treasury firm Upexi, told CoinDesk. “ This legislation is likely to spur more on-chain development and activity and that benefits altcoins more so than bitcoin,” Rudick added. “While the preponderance of digital asset treasury companies continue to be [for BTC], they are increasingly moving down the risk spectrum to assets like ETH, SOL, and beyond.” Case in point: since I last wrote to you on Friday, DeFi Development boosted its SOL holdings to almost $200 million; Bitmine and SharpLink’s leaders openly stated they’re in competition over the accumulation of ETH supply; The Ether Reserve (another ETH treasury firm) announced it will soon trade on Nasdaq (rebranding into The Ether Machine along the way); and a new company called StablecoinX declared its goal of constituting a treasury made of Ethena’s ENA tokens. Not that bitcoin has been unloved. In that same period, Michael Saylor dropped another $740 million into bitcoin, semiconductor firm Sequans invested $150 million, and Trump Media disclosed that its bitcoin stash was worth $2 billion. But the market capitalization of tokens like ETH, SOL and ENA is significantly smaller than bitcoin’s, so these treasury buys tend to have a much larger impact on their price, Rudick said. “As long as the U.S. continues to make progress on digital asset legislation and the market continues to receive digital asset treasury companies well, I would not be surprised if bitcoin dominance continued to fall and altcoin season truly emerges,” he added.",coindesk,https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2025/07/21/the-node-altcoin-season,BTC|ALTCOIN|REGULATION|SOL|TREASURY,Opinion|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Ether|Solana|Opinion,BTC,"The Node: Altcoin Season?.

Meanwhile, SOL finally caught up today by increasing 7%; the coin’s price is now 18% higher than last Monday. “It''s not surprising to see bitcoin dominance fall over the last month given progress around digital asset legislation in the U.S. and the continued emergence of altcoin treasury companies,” Brian Rudick, chief strategy officer at SOL treasury firm Upexi, told CoinDesk. “ This legislation is likely to spur more on-chain development and activity and that benefits altcoins more so than bitcoin,” Rudick added. “While the preponderance of digital asset treasury companies continue to be [for BTC], they are increasingly moving down the risk spectrum to assets like ETH, SOL, and beyond.” Case in point: since I last wrote to you on Friday, DeFi Development boosted its SOL holdings to almost $200 million; Bitmine and SharpLink’s leaders openly stated they’re in competition over the accumulation of ETH supply; The Ether Reserve (another ETH treasury firm) announced it will soon trade on Nasdaq (rebranding into The Ether Machine along the way); and a new company called StablecoinX declared its goal of constituting a treasury made of Ethena’s ENA tokens. Not that bitcoin has been unloved. In that same period, Michael Saylor dropped another $740 million into bitcoin, semiconductor firm Sequans invested $150 million, and Trump Media disclosed that its bitcoin stash was worth $2 billion. But the market capitalization of tokens like ETH, SOL and ENA is significantly smaller than bitcoin’s, so these treasury buys tend to have a much larger impact on their price, Rudick said. “As long as the U.S. continues to make progress on digital asset legislation and the market continues to receive digital asset treasury companies well, I would not be surprised if bitcoin dominance continued to fall and altcoin season truly emerges,” he added."
2025-07-21 19:21:03+00:00,"Altcoin Season Indicators: Ethereum Rockets 21%, XRP Hits ATH as Bitcoin Dominance Wanes","Bitcoin’s dominance is starting to slip as capital flows into a broader set of digital assets. From Ethereum’s sharp breakout to the resurgence of meme coins, the market has entered a phase of visible diversification. This raises a familiar question: Is an altcoin season underway? While the term often generates hype, verifying its arrival requires more than anecdotal gains. This analysis examines current price action, dominance metrics, and altcoin season indicators to assess whether the shift is technical noise or the beginning of a deeper rotation. Performance Snapshot: Ethereum, XRP, and Meme Tokens Ethereum surged from under $3,100 to over $3,750 in the first three weeks of July 2025, according to CoinMarketCap. The move coincided with a wave of liquidations and rising ETH inflows, especially into derivatives platforms. Market watchers tied the rally to anticipation around scaling upgrades and ETH’s improving market share. #Crypto market is up today, the market cap has surpassed $4 trillion, #BTC is back above $120,350, #ETH is nearing $4,000, and ETH spot #ETFs saw the second-highest inflows yet. https://t.co/j23H5XZsPn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 XRP outperformed even more dramatically. On July 17, it breached its previous all-time high, touching $3.49 before retreating slightly. CoinMarketCap data confirms this level marked a new price discovery zone, aided by regulatory clarity in Asia and adoption by financial services platforms. It is currently trading at $3.61. DOGE also participated in the rally. While not reaching new highs, it climbed nearly 40% in a two-week window, driven by retail enthusiasm and Elon Musk’s renewed social mentions. This broader participation suggests the rally was not limited to high-cap utility tokens alone. Interpreting the Climb with Altcoin Season Index As of July 21, the Altcoin Season Index— tracked by Blockchaincenter —stands at 59. This index measures the number of top 50 coins outperforming Bitcoin over the last 90 days. While 75 is the official “altcoin season” threshold, the current level marks a steep climb from 28 in early June. It shows a shift in relative strength, especially when paired with falling Bitcoin dominance. The trend is clear, even if the season isn’t official yet. CMC Altcoin Season Index (Source: CoinMarketCap) Similarly, the CMC Altcoin Season Index tracks the performance of 100 altcoins relative to Bitcoin for the past 90 days and is currently showing a reading of 56. Bitcoin Dominance and Capital Migration Bitcoin dominance dropped to 60.49% this week, its lowest level since March, according to TradingView’s BTC.D chart . The decline mirrors the expanding inflows into Ethereum, meme assets, and select infrastructure tokens. Historically, BTC.D falling below 50% has marked a transition toward broader risk appetite. ETH’s share of total market cap rose 1.5% in July, while DeFi tokens like AAVE and UNI posted double-digit weekly gains. These shifts show a familiar pattern: capital exits Bitcoin for potentially higher-yield altcoins when market sentiment turns risk-on. That behavior is now repeating, albeit more selectively than in prior cycles. Infrastructure Tokens and the Flight to Utility Analysts are flagging a parallel theme beneath the meme hype: a rotation into infrastructure plays with perceived longevity. Chainlink (LINK) , trading around $19, is attracting institutional interest again. LINK’s cross-chain interoperability could be seen as essential to upcoming RWAs and enterprise integrations. Cardano (ADA) Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Cardano (ADA) has risen by more than 50% over the past month, buoyed by recent ecosystem launches and expanded stablecoin options. ADA’s sustained community development and regulatory alignment could be factors in its rebound. Avalanche (AVAX), also up 50% over the past 30 days, is being watched for subnetwork upgrades. Analysts argue that these layer-1s are regaining traction not as Ethereum killers but as specialized tools for selective growth sectors. A Measured But Shifting Environment A full altcoin season is not yet confirmed. But with rising participation, declining BTC dominance, and renewed attention on utility-based tokens, the conditions are forming. If momentum continues, the coming weeks could mark a decisive phase in crypto’s internal capital rotation. Altcoin market cycles often move in phases, with early breakouts in majors like ETH and XRP followed by delayed gains in mid- and small-cap tokens. If historical patterns hold, the current broadening could indicate a more sustained altcoin-led period. However, volatility remains high, and sector rotations can reverse quickly. Investors should continue monitoring key indicators like dominance, volume flows, and relative strength to navigate what may be the early innings of an altcoin resurgence.

2025-07-21 19:23:57+00:00,Institutions Are Driving Ethereum''s ''Comeback'',"For a year, Ethereum, the second largest blockchain, has lived in the shadows of its competitors, as cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and solana jumped in price and dominated the conversation. Amid criticism from investors and some community members, ETH languished at levels below $1500 as recently as April. But on Monday ETH was near $3800, up 13% year-to-date, and analysts pointed to numerous signs of a turning point for the project. Some have pointed out that the momentum of the ecosystem has returned partially thanks to the explosion of stablecoins and tokenization on Ethereum. “For institutions looking to get exposure, Ethereum is the primary on-chain option, leading in real-world asset (RWA) tokenization with $7.8 billion in tokenized assets, or nearly 60% of the total RWA market cap,” said Jake Koch-Gollup, a research analyst at Messari, to CoinDesk. As of the beginning of July 2025, Whales with addresses that hold between 1,000-10,000 in ETH have increased their holdings of the token, according to data from Glassnode. Collectively they hold about 14 million ETH units, up from roughly 12 million at the end of 2024. Vivek Raman, who founded Etherealize and spends his time speaking with institutions to market ETH as an asset class, believes that ETH should be seen like BTC as “a store of value,"" comparing it to “ digital oil .” The layer-2 ecosystem, which are auxiliary blockchains atop of Ethereum used to transact for faster and cheaper, have appeared en masse over the past few years, and institutions have started to also build with them. JP Morgan recently announced they launched a proof-of-concept for tokenizing their deposits on Coinbase’s Base chain, while Robinhood, the retail trading giant, shared its plans to build its own layer-2 with the Arbitrum stack. If it works, it could bring Ethereum’s technology to an even broader mainstream audience and deepen its position as the backbone for a new generation of financial applications. Some believe layer-2 networks were taking away value from the Ethereum base layer and making user experience more disconnected , but Raman argues that institutions view them differently. According to Raman, the customizability of a layer-2 network is a plus for these institutions. “You can be a landlord and get access to the liquidity of Ethereum,” said Raman in an interview. “So the validation of the L2 ecosystem is now pretty undeniable.” Koch-Gollup, at Messari, believes that protocol changes that enhance the scaling of Ethereum as a base layer will position the network well for the future. “A 100-1,000x throughput jump collapses gas fees, reopens the space for consumer-grade apps, and refutes the “L2s are eating the L1” narrative,” he said. “Concurrently, bigger blocks and more activity feed back into base-fee burn, tightening ETH’s supply during periods of high demand.” Ethereum is also benefitting from the corporate treasury trend, with a growing number of companies adopting ETH as a strategic treasury asset. That is, not just for holding, but for staking to generate yield, signaling a shift from traditional treasury strategies, often limited to cash or bitcoin, to one that leverages Ethereum’s staking rewards, programmability, and integration into DeFi and stablecoin ecosystems. SharpLink Gaming, a NASDAQ-listed sports betting firm, BitMine, and BitDigital, both crypto mining firms, have all shifted their crypto treasury strategies to this. “SharpLink Gaming (SBET) saw its stock price [rise 412%] after announcing its ETH treasury strategy, showing there’s a clear market appetite for publicly traded companies holding ETH on their balance sheets,” Koch-Gollup told CoinDesk. The company is chaired by Joseph Lubin, one of the founders of Ethereum. BitMine, which recently saw Wall Street personality Tom Lee join, also shared that it holds over 300,000 ETH in its treasury. “Collectively, these trends suggest a deeper institutional re-rating of Ethereum, not just as infrastructure, but as a yield-bearing, balance-sheet-worthy asset and a directional bet on the future of on-chain finance,” Koch-Gollup said.

The report breaks down the typical stages of altcoin season and highlights how the Shiba Inu ecosystem, including SHIB, BONE, LEASH, and TREAT, is positioned to benefit. Shiba Inu Exec Shares Altcoin Season And SHIB Roadmap In a recent report published on X social media, Shiba Inu’s head of marketing, Lucie, presented a detailed roadmap of how the next altcoin season is set to unfold , along with a clear vision for SHIB’s expected performance throughout the cycle. According to Lucie, the process begins with Bitcoin leading the charge by breaking key resistance levels and regaining market dominance . Once BTC’s rally establishes a solid foothold, Ethereum typically follows , serving as the signal that capital is beginning to rotate into the broader altcoin market. At that point, top high-cap altcoins such as Solana, XRP, and others usually start gaining strong momentum. Once this happens, Shiba Inu is expected to enter the spotlight, with renewed interest being driven by the growing adoption and utility of Shibarium, the meme project’s layer-2 blockchain. Shibarium , powered by the BONE token as its native gas asset, offers real network utility and is seen by Lucie as a foundational component for Shiba Inu’s rise in the coming months. The marketing lead has also highlighted the return of LEASH, another Shiba Inu ecosystem token . She calls the coin a “sleeper underdog” that could see a resurgence as market attention intensifies. TREAT , the ecosystem’s upcoming reward and AI-integrated token , is also set to play a key role by bridging technological innovation with community incentives and decentralized finance rollouts. What Happens Next As Altcoin Season Unfolds Beyond the Shiba Inu ecosystem , Lucie laid out the typical phases of a standard altcoin season. As capital flows from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and top altcoins, mid and low-cap tokens often experience explosive rallies. The marketing lead revealed that these tokens could post gains of 5x to 100x as investors chase outsized returns. At the same time, meme coins tend to “moon,” propelled by social media hype and Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) from retail investors . Lucie disclosed that this surge in activity may lead to a spike in gas fees , especially on the Ethereum network, as transaction volume soars. However, the influx of new retail participants could lead to a rise in rug pulls , scam tokens, and fake projects that prey on inexperienced investors. As hype builds, the Shiba Inu executive notes that smart money could begin taking profits, creating exit liquidity as the latecomers rush in.

2025-07-21 19:45:30+00:00,Calamos Investments to Bring Laddered ETFs To Bitcoin,"Calamos’ Structured Protection ETF suite provides financial advisors and investors with monthly entry points to capital-protected growth strategies that offer exposure to Bitcoin over one-year outcome periods. The landmark product is one of the long line of past, present, and upcoming ETFs, focused on the leading asset. Diversifying Exposure Calamos Investments, an investment manager with over $40 billion in assets under management (AUM), filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week for three separate exchange-traded funds (ETFs): Calamos Laddered Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBOY) – designed to match the positive (spot) price return of Bitcoin up to a defined cap while protecting against 100% of losses over one year (before fees and expenses). Laddered Bitcoin 80 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBTY) – as CBOY, matches the positive (spot) price return up to a cap, whilst limiting maximum losses to 20%, over one year, before fees. Even if BTC’s price falls more than 20%, the ETF structure will not allow investors to lose more than 20% of their investment during the outcome period. Laddered Bitcoin 90 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBXY) – as CBTY, but the loss protection is 10%. This would be the latest addition to the ETFs the company offers specifically for Bitcoin, with each one delivering fluctuating levels of downside protection. “Providing exposure to Bitcoin with limits on losses (and upside) can appeal to financial advisors and investors who have been interested in crypto, but leery of the volatility,” noted Matt Kaufman, head of ETFs at Calamos.“The financial advisory community hasn’t broadly adopted Bitcoin or crypto,” he said. “This creates a bridge into Bitcoin for people who otherwise wouldn’t approach it.” The funds will utilize options and have exposure to the prices of up to five ETFs, which also happen to be the ones with the highest amounts of AUM, as of the time of writing, according to data from CoinGlass. The tracked prices will be from the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), with over $86 billion in assets under management, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), $4 billion AUM, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), $4.8B AUM, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $21 billion in managed assets, and Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) – $6 billion in AUM. The funds are “laddered,” meaning they are invested in a BTC ETF with varying outcome periods, which brings diversification through exposure to different Bitcoin ETFs over time, as per the prospectuses. Kaufman went further by elaborating that risk-adjusted returns in the portfolio can be altered, which could be enticing to investors, driving them to allocate more than 1% or 2% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, exceeding the general asset manager recommendation. “That may also be the case for early-stage crypto investors, whose wealth has grown exponentially, and who now want to reduce risk and trade pure Bitcoin holdings for ETFs.” An ETF Boom It appears that the institutional demand for Bitcoin ETF products remains insatiable. As CryptoPotato reported last week, such funds experienced a $7.78 billion inflow streak over 7 days. Moreover, BlackRock’s fund, IBIT, generated more revenue than the one tracking the S&P 500, despite being active for only about 1.5 years. It is also worthwhile to note that majority-owned by the U.S. President, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), filed for a Bitcoin ETF just last month.

Diversifying Exposure Calamos Investments, an investment manager with over $40 billion in assets under management (AUM), filed paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week for three separate exchange-traded funds (ETFs): Calamos Laddered Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBOY) – designed to match the positive (spot) price return of Bitcoin up to a defined cap while protecting against 100% of losses over one year (before fees and expenses). Laddered Bitcoin 80 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBTY) – as CBOY, matches the positive (spot) price return up to a cap, whilst limiting maximum losses to 20%, over one year, before fees. Even if BTC’s price falls more than 20%, the ETF structure will not allow investors to lose more than 20% of their investment during the outcome period. Laddered Bitcoin 90 Series Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBXY) – as CBTY, but the loss protection is 10%. This would be the latest addition to the ETFs the company offers specifically for Bitcoin, with each one delivering fluctuating levels of downside protection. “Providing exposure to Bitcoin with limits on losses (and upside) can appeal to financial advisors and investors who have been interested in crypto, but leery of the volatility,” noted Matt Kaufman, head of ETFs at Calamos.“The financial advisory community hasn’t broadly adopted Bitcoin or crypto,” he said. “This creates a bridge into Bitcoin for people who otherwise wouldn’t approach it.” The funds will utilize options and have exposure to the prices of up to five ETFs, which also happen to be the ones with the highest amounts of AUM, as of the time of writing, according to data from CoinGlass. The tracked prices will be from the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), with over $86 billion in assets under management, the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), $4 billion AUM, Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), $4.8B AUM, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with $21 billion in managed assets, and Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) – $6 billion in AUM. The funds are “laddered,” meaning they are invested in a BTC ETF with varying outcome periods, which brings diversification through exposure to different Bitcoin ETFs over time, as per the prospectuses. Kaufman went further by elaborating that risk-adjusted returns in the portfolio can be altered, which could be enticing to investors, driving them to allocate more than 1% or 2% of their portfolio to Bitcoin, exceeding the general asset manager recommendation. “That may also be the case for early-stage crypto investors, whose wealth has grown exponentially, and who now want to reduce risk and trade pure Bitcoin holdings for ETFs.” An ETF Boom It appears that the institutional demand for Bitcoin ETF products remains insatiable. As CryptoPotato reported last week, such funds experienced a $7.78 billion inflow streak over 7 days. Moreover, BlackRock’s fund, IBIT, generated more revenue than the one tracking the S&P 500, despite being active for only about 1.5 years. It is also worthwhile to note that majority-owned by the U.S. President, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), filed for a Bitcoin ETF just last month.

In a swift turn of events, BTC, the undisputed king of digital assets, has fallen below the significant $117,000 mark. This sudden movement has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting urgent questions about market stability and future trajectories. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or just beginning your crypto journey, understanding the dynamics behind such a shift is crucial for navigating the often-unpredictable digital asset landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, a trusted source for cryptocurrency insights, a significant Bitcoin price drop has been observed. BTC is currently trading at $116,953.77 on the Binance USDT market. This specific figure highlights a notable dip from recent highs, signaling a moment of caution for many market participants. Such precise data points are vital for traders and long-term holders alike, as they provide an immediate snapshot of market sentiment and momentum. A decline of this nature, particularly when a key psychological level like $117,000 is breached, can trigger a cascade of reactions across the broader crypto ecosystem. While the immediate cause might appear singular, the underlying forces are often complex, reflecting a confluence of macroeconomic indicators, investor behavior, and technical trading signals. It’s important to remember that volatility is a characteristic feature of the crypto market, and a Bitcoin price drop , while unsettling, is not an uncommon occurrence in its history. What Factors Influence a Bitcoin Price Drop? A significant Bitcoin price drop is rarely an isolated event, stemming from a single cause. Instead, it typically arises from a combination of interconnected factors, each playing a role in shaping market sentiment and liquidity. Understanding these elements is paramount for anyone looking to make informed decisions in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Here are some of the key drivers that frequently contribute to a downturn in Bitcoin’s value: Macroeconomic Trends: Global economic indicators, such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, and recession fears, can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. When traditional markets show signs of instability, investors may pull capital from riskier ventures, leading to a Bitcoin price drop . Regulatory News and Crackdowns: Announcements of new regulations, bans, or increased scrutiny from governments worldwide can create uncertainty and fear within the crypto community. Countries implementing stricter rules on mining, trading, or stablecoins can trigger sell-offs as investors react to potential future limitations or compliance burdens. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as “whales,” can significantly influence market prices. A major sale by a whale can flood the market with supply, pushing prices down. Conversely, large purchases can drive prices up. Monitoring significant on-chain movements can sometimes provide early indicators of potential shifts. Technical Analysis Signals: Traders often rely on technical indicators and chart patterns. When Bitcoin breaks below crucial support levels, like the $117,000 mark in this instance, it can trigger automated sell orders and panic selling among those who follow technical analysis, exacerbating a Bitcoin price drop . Global Events and Geopolitical Tensions: Major international events, such as conflicts, pandemics, or significant political shifts, can lead to widespread market instability. In times of global uncertainty, investors often seek safety in traditional assets, diverting funds away from cryptocurrencies. Market Sentiment and FUD: “Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt” (FUD) can spread rapidly through social media and news cycles. Negative narratives, even if unfounded, can lead to a collective loss of confidence, prompting widespread selling and contributing to a rapid Bitcoin price drop . Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities During a Significant BTC Price Fall While a Bitcoin price drop can certainly be unsettling, particularly for those with substantial holdings, it’s essential to recognize that such periods also present both challenges and unique opportunities. The immediate reaction for many is often emotional, leading to hasty decisions that might not align with their long-term investment goals. The primary challenges include: Emotional Impact and Panic Selling: The sight of a declining portfolio can trigger fear, leading some investors to sell their assets at a loss, often at the worst possible time.

In 2022, JPMorgan Chase acquired a 48.5% stake in Viva, while Werealize, a company owned by Viva’s CEO Haris Karonis, held the remaining 51.49%. JPMorgan and Werealize’s shareholder agreement reportedly specified that if Viva’s valuation fell below EUR 5 billion ($5.81 billion) by July 30th, 2025, JPMorgan would have the right to exercise a call option to assume full control of the company. When JPMorgan was unable to trigger a call option on Viva, the bank filed its suit, claiming that Viva blocked key business opportunities, sabotaging the company and reducing its valuation. Reuters reports that following court proceedings, JPMorgan must stand down on its lawsuit. A spokesperson for WeRealize says that the bank should “engage in productive discussions” about Viva’s future. “JPM must now step aside and allow Viva to continue growing and reach its full commercial potential.” Says a spokesperson for the bank, “While we will continue to address their litigious tactics, and many matters are still being resolved by the courts, our commitment remains steadfast to the business and our investment.” Both JPMorgan and Werealize have also filed defamation suits against each other in Greece.

Crypto.com endured even steeper decrease losing 61% of its volume through the quarter. Coinbase also booked less volume. The declines for CEXs happened as bitcoin (BTC) spiked to a fresh all-time record, which usually bolsters trading appetite.

Meanwhile, centralized exchanges (CEXes) saw a sharp pullback, with spot volume across the top platforms falling nearly 28% to $3.9 trillion. This means the DEX-to-CEX trading volume ratio jumped to a record high 0.23, perhaps pointing to a growing investor demand for trading directly on-chain.

2025-07-21 20:05:25+00:00,"Whale Inflows Surge, Daily Inflows Dip – What’s Next for Bitcoin?","Bitcoin hit record highs above $123,000 last week before pulling back. On Monday, it edged closer to $119,600. As prices consolidate below this level, whales are actively locking in profits. This behavior could affect the crypto asset’s near-term price movement if selling pressure increases. Whale Activity Spikes Upon focusing on monthly average BTC inflows to reduce noise, CryptoQuant found that during the last two market tops, whale inflows to crypto exchanges surpassed $75 billion. This triggered correction or consolidation phases. Currently, the monthly average has risen sharply by nearly $17 billion after climbing from $28 billion to $45 billion between July 14 and 18. The increase likely reflects the recent 80,000 BTC movement while indicating that whales have used Bitcoin’s new all-time high to secure profits. However, a quick look at daily inflows now shows a clear decline, a development that CryptoQuant thinks should be monitored closely. If this declining trend in daily inflows continues, it could ease overall selling pressure in the market, as whale activity has historically exerted significant influence during previous tops. While the current inflow level remains below the previous peak levels that triggered corrections, the recent rise suggests whales are active. Path Forward The macro environment is another factor to consider for BTC’s trajectory in the coming days. However, economic events such as US housing data, PMIs, and durable goods orders are unlikely to significantly impact high-risk assets like Bitcoin this week. Moreover, futures markets predict the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged at its upcoming July 30 meeting. Such a move is expected to reduce immediate macroeconomic pressure on crypto markets. Broader crypto market capitalization has pulled back slightly from a $4 trillion peak but remains up by over 17% year-to-date. The risk sentiment could transform as major tech earnings reports arrive this week, which, in turn, could influence the leading crypto asset’s price action. While markets assess Bitcoin’s next move, not all voices remain bullish at these price levels. In fact, Robert Kiyosaki, author of “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” warned on Monday that Bitcoin, along with gold and silver, could face a sharp decline if current “bubbles” burst. Kiyosaki stated that he plans to buy these assets only after such a correction.

2025-07-21 20:10:20+00:00,FTX Foreign Claims: Crucial Delay in $470M Repayment Dispute,"BitcoinWorld FTX Foreign Claims: Crucial Delay in $470M Repayment Dispute The saga of FTX, once a titan in the cryptocurrency world, continues to unfold with new twists and turns, particularly concerning the repayment of funds to its multitude of creditors. Just when it seemed a path to recovery was becoming clearer, a significant hurdle has emerged: a crucial request for delay in the ongoing FTX foreign claims dispute. This development directly impacts hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for creditors in specific regions, adding another layer of complexity to an already intricate bankruptcy proceeding. The Heart of the Matter: Why the Delay in FTX Foreign Claims Repayments? At the core of this latest development is FTX’s estate seeking additional time to address a staggering number of objections—over 90, to be precise—against its proposal. This plan aimed to pause approximately $470 million in repayments to creditors residing in 49 “restricted” countries. The sheer volume of these objections highlights the widespread concern and legal challenges surrounding the distribution of assets. The breakdown of these funds is particularly telling: Total amount in dispute: Approximately $470 million Number of affected countries: 49 “restricted” jurisdictions Largest single portion: $380 million attributed to creditors in China Why the delay? The FTX estate cites significant legal risks intertwined with the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency regulations. Navigating the legal frameworks of nearly 50 different nations, especially concerning digital assets, is a monumental task. Each country might have unique interpretations, prohibitions, or requirements regarding crypto ownership, transfers, and insolvency proceedings. This regulatory labyrinth presents a formidable challenge for the estate as it strives for a fair and legally compliant distribution. The implications of this delay are far-reaching. For the creditors in these restricted countries, it means prolonged uncertainty and potentially a longer wait for their funds. The legal team handling the FTX bankruptcy faces the daunting task of meticulously reviewing each objection, understanding its basis, and formulating a robust response that aligns with international law and the specific nuances of crypto regulations in each jurisdiction. Navigating the Complexities of International FTX Foreign Claims and Crypto Regulations The challenge FTX faces isn’t just about identifying creditors; it’s about the legality of sending crypto-related funds across borders to jurisdictions with varying, often strict, crypto policies. Many countries, including China, have implemented significant restrictions or outright bans on cryptocurrency trading and related activities. This creates a precarious situation for the FTX estate: Compliance Risks: Sending funds to individuals in countries where crypto is heavily regulated or prohibited could expose the FTX estate to legal repercussions from those governments. Enforcement Challenges: Even if funds are released, ensuring they reach the rightful creditors without violating local laws or being confiscated by authorities is a complex logistical and legal puzzle. Defining “Restricted”: The criteria for deeming a country “restricted” likely involves a careful assessment of its current and anticipated crypto regulatory environment, potential for asset seizure, or difficulties in legal recognition of crypto claims. This situation underscores a broader issue in the global cryptocurrency ecosystem: the lack of a harmonized international regulatory framework. As crypto assets transcend geographical boundaries, insolvencies like FTX’s highlight the urgent need for clearer, more consistent international guidelines for handling digital assets in cross-border disputes. Without such clarity, similar delays and disputes are likely to plague future international crypto bankruptcies. Impact on Creditors: Who Bears the Brunt of the FTX Foreign Claims Delay? For the tens of thousands of creditors residing in these 49 “restricted” countries, the news of a delay is undoubtedly disheartening. Many have already endured a prolonged period of financial uncertainty since FTX’s collapse in November 2022. The $470 million represents a significant portion of the total assets, and its delayed distribution means continued financial limbo for a substantial group of claimants. Consider the varied experiences: Individual Creditors: Small-scale investors who lost their life savings or significant portions of their portfolios are particularly vulnerable. The delay can exacerbate financial distress. Institutional Creditors: While potentially more resilient, institutions also face liquidity challenges and prolonged balance sheet uncertainty due to locked funds. Geographical Disparity: Creditors in countries like China, accounting for the largest share of the disputed funds, face unique challenges given their domestic crypto prohibitions.

BitcoinWorld FTX Foreign Claims: Crucial Delay in $470M Repayment Dispute The saga of FTX, once a titan in the cryptocurrency world, continues to unfold with new twists and turns, particularly concerning the repayment of funds to its multitude of creditors. Just when it seemed a path to recovery was becoming clearer, a significant hurdle has emerged: a crucial request for delay in the ongoing FTX foreign claims dispute. This development directly impacts hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for creditors in specific regions, adding another layer of complexity to an already intricate bankruptcy proceeding. The Heart of the Matter: Why the Delay in FTX Foreign Claims Repayments? At the core of this latest development is FTX’s estate seeking additional time to address a staggering number of objections—over 90, to be precise—against its proposal.

2025-07-21 20:25:19+00:00,U.S. Stock Market: Navigating the Mixed Signals and Their Impact,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Market: Navigating the Mixed Signals and Their Impact In the dynamic realm of digital assets, it’s common for investors to be singularly focused on the daily fluctuations of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, seasoned market watchers understand that the broader financial landscape, particularly the U.S. stock market , often provides critical indicators for what might lie ahead for the crypto space. Recently, the major U.S. stock market indices concluded trading with a distinctly mixed performance, a scenario that demands a closer look for anyone seeking to grasp the interconnectedness of global finance and its ripple effects on digital currencies. Understanding the Recent U.S. Stock Market Performance The latest closing bell revealed a nuanced picture for the three primary barometers of the American economy. While two key indices registered gains, one experienced a slight dip, painting a ‘mixed’ outcome rather than a clear bullish or bearish trend. This divergence often reflects underlying shifts in investor sentiment and sector-specific performance within the vast U.S. stock market . Let’s break down the individual performances: S&P 500: This index, widely regarded as the best gauge of large-cap U.S. equities, edged up by +0.14% . Its positive movement suggests continued resilience in a broad range of leading American companies. Nasdaq Composite: Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, the Nasdaq saw a more substantial gain of +0.38% . This indicates robust investor confidence in the tech sector, which often correlates with higher risk appetite in broader markets, including crypto. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA): Representing 30 significant U.S. companies, the Dow recorded a minor decline of -0.04% . This slight contraction in industrial and traditional blue-chip stocks suggests some caution among investors, possibly due to concerns about inflation or economic growth. This mixed closing of the U.S. stock market indices illustrates a complex interplay of forces. It’s not a uniform surge or retreat, but rather a selective movement that can offer insights into which sectors are thriving and which are facing headwinds. Why Does U.S. Stock Market Volatility Matter to Crypto Investors? For those primarily invested in cryptocurrencies, it might seem counterintuitive to closely monitor the traditional stock market. However, the financial world is increasingly interconnected. The concept of ‘risk-on, risk-off’ sentiment plays a crucial role: Risk-On: When traditional markets, especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq, perform well, it often signals a ‘risk-on’ environment. Investors are more willing to take on risk, which can translate into increased capital flowing into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Risk-Off: Conversely, when the U.S. stock market shows signs of weakness or fear, investors tend to move towards safer assets, leading to a ‘risk-off’ environment. This can cause outflows from crypto as capital seeks stability. Furthermore, the growing institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies means that large financial entities, which manage both traditional stocks and digital assets, are increasingly influencing both markets. Their portfolio rebalancing decisions can create significant spillover effects. Understanding the U.S. stock market provides a broader context for these capital flows. Decoding the Factors Behind the Mixed U.S. Stock Market Close Several underlying factors contribute to the varied performance seen in the U.S. stock market : Economic Indicators and Central Bank Policy Inflation data, employment figures, and consumer spending reports all play a role. If inflation remains high, the Federal Reserve might continue with hawkish monetary policies, such as interest rate hikes, which can dampen enthusiasm for growth stocks and riskier assets. Conversely, signs of economic cooling might lead to more dovish stances, potentially boosting market sentiment. Corporate Earnings Reports Individual company performance significantly impacts indices. Strong earnings from tech giants can buoy the Nasdaq, while weaker-than-expected results from industrial stalwarts might drag down the Dow. The mixed nature of recent earnings seasons often leads to mixed market reactions. Geopolitical Developments Global events, such as international conflicts, trade tensions, or supply chain disruptions, can introduce uncertainty and volatility into the U.S. stock market . These external shocks can cause investors to become more cautious, affecting different sectors unevenly. Sector Rotation Sometimes, investors rotate capital between different sectors. For instance, they might shift from growth stocks (often found in the Nasdaq) to value stocks or defensive sectors (more prevalent in the Dow or S&P 500) based on economic outlooks.

2025-07-21 20:30:06+00:00,Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign?,"Data shows Altcoins are breaking away from Bitcoin’s lead. Here’s what that could mean for the market, based on historical trends. Altcoins Are Witnessing A Fast Drop In Correlation To Bitcoin In a new post on X, analytics firm Alphractal has discussed how the Correlation between Bitcoin and the altcoins has changed recently. The Correlation is an indicator that keeps track of how tied together the prices of any two assets are. The metric can take on both positive and negative values. In both cases, some relationship exists between the assets, but the relative movement in their prices is different. Related Reading: This Ethereum Metric Called The Bottom Ahead Of Rally, Says Analytics Firm When the indicator has a positive value, it means one asset is reacting to movements in the other by moving in the same direction. The closer is the metric to 1, the stronger is this relationship. On the other hand, it being under zero suggests a negative correlation exists between the assets: they are moving in opposite directions. In this case, the extreme point lies at -1. If the Correlation is sitting exactly at zero, it suggests no relationship exists between the two prices at all. In statistics, this condition corresponds to the variables being independent. Now, here is the heatmap shared by Aphractal that shows the trend in the Correlation between Bitcoin and the various altcoins in the sector: As is visible above, the Correlation between Bitcoin and the different altcoins was close to 1 just earlier, but the indicator has seen a quick decline since then. The average value of the indicator for the two has now dipped toward the zero level and has even turned slightly negative. This change would suggest that while the altcoins were closely following the footsteps of the original cryptocurrency before, they are now following a chart that’s more or less independent. This trend, however, may not actually be a positive sign for the sector. “Historically, low correlation is a red flag,” explains the analytics firm. “It often precedes periods of high volatility and mass liquidations — whether from shorts or longs.” From the chart, it’s apparent that the last time the Correlation between Bitcoin and the altcoins plunged to zero was back in May, and what followed was a price jump for the asset. In January, the same trend marked the market top instead. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Flashes Signal That Last Led To 630% Surge The latest low Correlation between BTC and the alts has come as various assets have broken out and market dominance has seen a shakeup. “Altcoins have been outperforming Bitcoin in recent days, with daily signals suggesting it’s been more profitable to stay positioned in altcoins rather than BTC,” notes Alphractal.

2025-07-21 20:40:15+00:00,Bitcoin Acquisition: Unlocking MicroStrategy’s Bold New IPO Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: Unlocking MicroStrategy’s Bold New IPO Strategy In the dynamic world of digital assets, certain companies consistently push the boundaries, reshaping how traditional finance interacts with cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin powerhouse, is once again at the forefront. Their recent announcement of an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 5 million shares of its STRC stock, with proceeds earmarked for general corporate purposes including further Bitcoin acquisition , marks a pivotal moment. This isn’t just a financial maneuver; it’s a strategic declaration that could set a new precedent for corporate treasury management in the digital age. What is MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy? MicroStrategy’s journey into the world of Bitcoin began in August 2020, when it adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Since then, the company, under the leadership of its executive chairman Michael Saylor, has steadily accumulated a significant amount of Bitcoin, positioning itself as the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency. This aggressive Bitcoin acquisition strategy has been funded through various means, including convertible notes and debt offerings. The latest development, as reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, involves an IPO of 5 million shares of its STRC stock. An IPO is when a private company first offers shares to the public, turning it into a public company. For MicroStrategy, a company already publicly traded, this means a secondary offering, issuing new shares to raise additional capital. The crucial detail here is the stated purpose of these funds: “general corporate purposes, including additional Bitcoin acquisition .” This explicit mention underscores MicroStrategy’s unwavering commitment to its digital asset strategy, reinforcing its unique position in both the tech and crypto sectors. This move highlights several key aspects of MicroStrategy’s approach: Strategic Intent: It reaffirms Bitcoin as a core component of their long-term financial strategy, not merely a speculative holding. Capital Allocation: It demonstrates a clear pathway for funding further digital asset purchases through equity markets. Market Signal: It sends a strong message to both traditional investors and the crypto community about the potential for large-scale corporate adoption of Bitcoin. Why is This Bitcoin Acquisition Move So Significant for the Crypto Market? MicroStrategy’s continued commitment to Bitcoin acquisition , especially through a public offering, carries immense weight for the broader cryptocurrency market. It’s more than just one company buying Bitcoin; it’s a testament to the growing institutional acceptance and validation of digital assets as legitimate treasury reserves and investment vehicles. This move could influence how other corporations view and potentially integrate cryptocurrencies into their own financial frameworks. Benefits for the Market: Increased Institutional Confidence: When a publicly traded company like MicroStrategy continues to raise capital specifically for Bitcoin, it signals confidence to other institutional players, potentially encouraging them to explore similar strategies. Supply Dynamics: Consistent, large-scale Bitcoin acquisition by corporations reduces the circulating supply, which can have long-term implications for Bitcoin’s price stability and growth. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Every such corporate move further normalizes Bitcoin in mainstream finance, chipping away at skepticism and paving the way for wider acceptance. Precedent Setting: MicroStrategy acts as a trailblazer, providing a real-world example of how a company can integrate a digital asset strategy into its core operations and funding mechanisms. Potential Challenges for the Market: Market Volatility: While beneficial in the long run, large corporate purchases can also contribute to short-term volatility if not managed carefully. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased corporate exposure to Bitcoin may invite more attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to new rules or guidelines. Concentration Risk: A significant portion of Bitcoin held by a few large entities could, in theory, lead to concerns about market manipulation, though this is less likely given Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. How Does an IPO Fuel a Massive Bitcoin Acquisition ? Understanding the mechanics behind how an IPO can fund substantial Bitcoin acquisition is key to appreciating MicroStrategy’s strategy. An IPO, or in this case, a secondary public offering, allows a company to raise capital by selling new shares to investors. These investors, both institutional and retail, purchase the shares, providing the company with cash. The funds generated from the sale of these 5 million shares flow directly into MicroStrategy’s coffers.

Supply Dynamics: Consistent, large-scale Bitcoin acquisition by corporations reduces the circulating supply, which can have long-term implications for Bitcoin’s price stability and growth. Legitimacy and Mainstream Adoption: Every such corporate move further normalizes Bitcoin in mainstream finance, chipping away at skepticism and paving the way for wider acceptance. Precedent Setting: MicroStrategy acts as a trailblazer, providing a real-world example of how a company can integrate a digital asset strategy into its core operations and funding mechanisms. Potential Challenges for the Market: Market Volatility: While beneficial in the long run, large corporate purchases can also contribute to short-term volatility if not managed carefully. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased corporate exposure to Bitcoin may invite more attention from financial regulators, potentially leading to new rules or guidelines. Concentration Risk: A significant portion of Bitcoin held by a few large entities could, in theory, lead to concerns about market manipulation, though this is less likely given Bitcoin’s decentralized nature. How Does an IPO Fuel a Massive Bitcoin Acquisition ? Understanding the mechanics behind how an IPO can fund substantial Bitcoin acquisition is key to appreciating MicroStrategy’s strategy. An IPO, or in this case, a secondary public offering, allows a company to raise capital by selling new shares to investors. These investors, both institutional and retail, purchase the shares, providing the company with cash. The funds generated from the sale of these 5 million shares flow directly into MicroStrategy’s coffers. Once these funds are available, the company’s management and board decide on their allocation, guided by the st"

2025-07-21 21:10:18+00:00,Ethereum Bitcoin: Peter Schiff’s Bold Call to Action for Your Portfolio,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Bitcoin: Peter Schiff’s Bold Call to Action for Your Portfolio The world of cryptocurrency is no stranger to bold predictions and surprising takes, especially from figures known for their skepticism towards digital assets. One such voice, Peter Schiff, the staunch gold advocate and CEO of Euro Pacific Capital, recently dropped a bombshell on X, igniting a fresh debate within the crypto community. His advice? Consider an Ethereum Bitcoin trade – specifically, selling your Ether (ETH) to buy Bitcoin (BTC). This unexpected counsel from a long-time crypto critic has sent ripples through the market, prompting investors to re-evaluate their strategies and ponder the underlying reasons behind such a striking recommendation. Could there be a compelling argument for shifting from the second-largest cryptocurrency to the first? Why the Ethereum Bitcoin Debate Intensifies with Peter Schiff’s Advice? Peter Schiff is famously known for his unwavering belief in gold as the ultimate store of value and his consistent skepticism regarding cryptocurrencies. For years, he has dismissed Bitcoin and other digital assets as speculative bubbles, destined for collapse. This long-standing stance makes his recent commentary on an Ethereum Bitcoin swap particularly noteworthy and, for many, quite shocking. On X, Schiff stated, “As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether.” His reasoning, while concise, offers a crucial insight into his perspective. He added that “Ether has more acknowledged competition for the narrative of its use case.” This statement highlights a core difference in how Bitcoin and Ethereum are perceived, even by a critic like Schiff. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” primarily serves as a decentralized store of value and a medium of exchange. Its narrative is relatively singular and well-established. Ethereum, on the other hand, powers a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi), constantly evolving and facing new competitors in the smart contract platform space. Schiff’s observation suggests that while he remains critical of all cryptocurrencies, he sees Bitcoin’s narrative as more robust and less susceptible to disruption compared to Ethereum’s multifaceted and competitive landscape. This doesn’t mean he has become a crypto evangelist; rather, it’s a strategic concession within his overall bearish outlook, implying that if one must hold crypto, Bitcoin might be the “less bad” option. This perspective adds a unique layer to the ongoing Ethereum Bitcoin discussion, urging investors to consider not just technological prowess but also narrative strength and competitive positioning. Understanding the Ethereum Bitcoin Landscape: A Comparison To fully grasp the implications of Peter Schiff’s advice, it’s essential to understand the fundamental differences and similarities between Bitcoin and Ethereum. While both are leading cryptocurrencies, their design, purpose, and ecosystems diverge significantly. This comparison is crucial for anyone considering an Ethereum Bitcoin portfolio adjustment. Here’s a simplified overview: Bitcoin (BTC): The Digital Gold Primary Purpose: Store of value, peer-to-peer digital cash. Technology: Simple blockchain, primarily for transactions. Supply: Capped at 21 million coins, creating scarcity. Narrative: Decentralized, censorship-resistant, inflation-hedge. Competition: Limited direct competition for its “digital gold” narrative. Ethereum (ETH): The World Computer Primary Purpose: Platform for smart contracts, dApps, DeFi, NFTs. Technology: Complex blockchain, Turing-complete, supports a vast ecosystem. Supply: No fixed cap, but supply changes with burning mechanisms (EIP-1559) and issuance. Narrative: Programmable money, Web3 foundation, innovation hub. Competition: Faces significant competition from other Layer 1 blockchains (e.g., Solana, Avalanche, Cardano) for dApp development and user adoption. Schiff’s point about “acknowledged competition” for Ethereum is valid. While Ethereum holds a dominant position in the smart contract space, it is constantly challenged by newer, often faster and cheaper, blockchains. This competition puts pressure on Ethereum to innovate and scale, leading to developments like the Merge and future sharding upgrades. Bitcoin, by contrast, faces less direct competition in its niche as a decentralized, scarce digital asset. Its narrative as a safe haven or a long-term store of value remains largely unchallenged by other cryptocurrencies, although it does compete with traditional assets like gold. This fundamental distinction forms the bedrock of Schiff’s surprising recommendation, suggesting that even a crypto skeptic recognizes the different risk profiles inherent in the Ethereum Bitcoin dynamic.

2025-07-21 22:00:19+00:00,3 Altcoins Whales Are Secretly Buying Right Now: Best Coins for the Next Bull Run,"In what looks like a full bull run cycle, Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate investor attention as crypto markets show signs of revival, with institutional inflows and bullish technical setups fueling optimism. While Bitcoin is nearing its recent all-time high of $123,200 once again and Ethereum (ETH) surged past $3,600, several on-chain tracking platforms and presale dashboards have flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most-watched altcoins among whales and early alpha groups. MAGA (Magacoin): The Political Coin Turning Heads While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, a quieter, yet far more explosive narrative is unfolding beneath the surface. Smart investors are rotating early into MAGACOIN FINANCE , a politically charged, community-powered project that’s quickly emerging as 2025’s highest-conviction altcoin play. This coin is a movement structured for long-term upside, designed for full decentralization from Day 1, and 100% public ownership. There are no VC allocations, no central wallets – just a frictionless, ideology-driven financial ecosystem that’s already attracting top crypto analysts and whales looking to front-run the next cultural breakout. Recent upgrades, including cross-wallet sync with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet, are already live. User growth is accelerating, investor communities are doubling in size weekly, and momentum across altcoins is pushing MAGACOIN onto the radar of major radar groups and exchange watchers. Backed by audit-verified contracts from CertiK and HashEx, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building infrastructure. This is a serious asset with a mission rooted in decentralization, political relevance, and real user control. Analysts are calling it “a breakout waiting to happen,” and comparing early-stage traction to historic runs from PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE. But what sets MAGACOIN apart is timing, and timing is everything. As institutions flood into Bitcoin and Ethereum through ETFs, retail investors are rushing toward assets that offer real meaning with strong utilities. Presale access remains the best strategic entry point. Early adopters secure premium token allocations, staking multipliers, and community governance advantages that won’t be available post-listing. However, the window to enter early is closing. Bitcoin (BTC): Momentum Builds Near Breakout Apex Bitcoin is consolidating around $120,200 after a powerful run from below $95,000, with price action forming a maturing symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. The structure points to growing compression and an imminent volatility breakout, especially as the apex nears. Key exponential moving averages, such as the 20/50/100/200 EMA, are stacked below the price, with the 20 EMA at $118,600 providing dynamic support. Meanwhile, on-chain momentum remains bullish. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) continues to rise, indicating consistent buying interest. Derivatives data backs the trend: open interest has climbed 1.77% to $87.75 billion, while the long/short ratio stands at 1.0255, favoring bulls. Notably, options volume has surged above $110 billion, and top Binance traders are heavily long, with a long/short ratio of 1.87. The weekly chart confirms a long-term bullish reversal via an inverse head and shoulders targeting $135,000–$140,000. On the ETF front, issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity have invested over $5 billion in the Bitcoin market in the last two weeks alone. As Bitcoin dominance drops to 61.7%, altcoins are gaining traction. However, this risk-on environment is historically bullish for Bitcoin itself. A breakout above $122,000 with whale accumulation could fuel a rally to $125,000 and beyond. Ethereum Sees Historic ETF Inflows as Price Hits $3,651 Ethereum surged 8.4% in the past day to trade at $3,651, boosted by a record-breaking $726 million in ETF inflows on July 16, the largest single-day spike since U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs launched. The bulk of the demand came from institutional giants, such as BlackRock, which invested $499.2 million in its ETHA fund. Fidelity followed with $113.3 million, while Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco added to the momentum. Altogether, total Ethereum ETF inflows have now reached $7.1 billion, reflecting growing interest from hedge funds and portfolio managers diversifying into digital assets. Technically, ETH has broken out of a bullish structure, and with the daily MACD and RSI both flashing buy signals, analysts expect Ethereum to test the $4,000 level soon. Its dominance in DeFi, backed by $74 billion in total value locked, continues to anchor its appeal to crypto whales preparing for the next bull leg. Conclusion As analysts project breakout potential for coins with real traction and real values, MAGACOIN’s mix of decentralized design, mechanics, and ideological clarity is making it a top contender for 2025’s altcoin breakout. Top crypto analysts on X project the token to surge by 3,500% in the next few days as the MAGACOIN presale nears its final stages.

While Bitcoin is nearing its recent all-time high of $123,200 once again and Ethereum (ETH) surged past $3,600, several on-chain tracking platforms and presale dashboards have flagged MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most-watched altcoins among whales and early alpha groups. MAGA (Magacoin): The Political Coin Turning Heads While Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate headlines, a quieter, yet far more explosive narrative is unfolding beneath the surface. Smart investors are rotating early into MAGACOIN FINANCE , a politically charged, community-powered project that’s quickly emerging as 2025’s highest-conviction altcoin play. This coin is a movement structured for long-term upside, designed for full decentralization from Day 1, and 100% public ownership. There are no VC allocations, no central wallets – just a frictionless, ideology-driven financial ecosystem that’s already attracting top crypto analysts and whales looking to front-run the next cultural breakout. Recent upgrades, including cross-wallet sync with MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet, are already live. User growth is accelerating, investor communities are doubling in size weekly, and momentum across altcoins is pushing MAGACOIN onto the radar of major radar groups and exchange watchers. Backed by audit-verified contracts from CertiK and HashEx, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building infrastructure. This is a serious asset with a mission rooted in decentralization, political relevance, and real user control. Analysts are calling it “a breakout waiting to happen,” and comparing early-stage traction to historic runs from PEPE, SHIB, and DOGE. But what sets MAGACOIN apart is timing, and timing is everything. As institutions flood into Bitcoin and Ethereum through ETFs, retail investors are rushing toward assets that offer real meaning with strong utilities. Presale access remains the best strategic entry point. Early adopters secure premium token allocations, staking multipliers, and community governance advantages that won’t be available post-listing. However, the window to enter early is closing. Bitcoin (BTC): Momentum Builds Near Breakout Apex Bitcoin is consolidating around $120,200 after a powerful run from below $95,000, with price action forming a maturing symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart. The structure points to growing compression and an imminent volatility breakout, especially as the apex nears. Key exponential moving averages, such as the 20/50/100/200 EMA, are stacked below the price, with the 20 EMA at $118,600 providing dynamic support. Meanwhile, on-chain momentum remains bullish. The On-Balance Volume (OBV) continues to rise, indicating consistent buying interest. Derivatives data backs the trend: open interest has climbed 1.77% to $87.75 billion, while the long/short ratio stands at 1.0255, favoring bulls. Notably, options volume has surged above $110 billion, and top Binance traders are heavily long, with a long/short ratio of 1.87. The weekly chart confirms a long-term bullish reversal via an inverse head and shoulders targeting $135,000–$140,000. On the ETF front, issuers such as BlackRock and Fidelity have invested over $5 billion in the Bitcoin market in the last two weeks alone. As Bitcoin dominance drops to 61.7%, altcoins are gaining traction. However, this risk-on environment is historically bullish for Bitcoin itself. A breakout above $122,000 with whale accumulation could fuel a rally to $125,000 and beyond. Ethereum Sees Historic ETF Inflows as Price Hits $3,651 Ethereum surged 8.4% in the past day to trade at $3,651, boosted by a record-breaking $726 million in ETF inflows on July 16, the largest single-day spike since U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs launched. The bulk of the demand came from institutional giants, such as BlackRock, which invested $499.2 million in its ETHA fund. Fidelity followed with $113.3 million, while Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and Invesco added to the momentum. Altogether, total Ethereum ETF inflows have now reached $7.1 billion, reflecting growing interest from hedge funds and portfolio managers diversifying into digital assets. Technically, ETH has broken out of a bullish structure, and with the daily MACD and RSI both flashing buy signals, analysts expect Ethereum to test the $4,000 level soon. Its dominance in DeFi, backed by $74 billion in total value locked, continues to anchor its appeal to crypto whales preparing for the next bull leg. Conclusion As analysts project breakout potential for coins with real traction and real values, MAGACOIN’s mix of decentralized design, mechanics, and ideological clarity is making it a top contender for 2025’s altcoin breakout. Top crypto analysts on X project the token to surge by 3,500% in the next few days as the MAGACOIN presale nears its final stages. Ea"
2025-07-21 22:00:23+00:00,Institutional Demand Surges As Ethereum Sets New Inflow Records,"Ethereum is once again in the spotlight as institutional capital continues to flood into the market at an unprecedented pace. This surge in demand reflects institutional investors who are increasingly viewing ETH as a valuable asset. Ethereum Turns Heads As Inflows Accelerate According to Axel Gaubert’s post on X, ETH is pumping hard after $2.77 billion was added to BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF (ETHA). This signals immense institutional appetite for the asset and underscores growing confidence in Ethereum’s role as both a financial instrument and a foundational layer for decentralized applications. Related Reading: Crypto Founder Pushes Ethereum As ‘World Reserve Asset’ – Details Gaubert notes that the inflows reflect mainstream validation, but create questions around Satoshi’s philosophy. The core ideals of decentralization and independence from traditional finance are being tested as legacy institutions like BlackRock move in, and Ethereum is a very opinionated blockchain. The fact that BlackRock can now build on Ethereum and accumulate ETH at scale reflects Ethereum’s core philosophy, open access, programmable money, and institutional-grade architecture. Ethereum continues to make history as institutional interest surges to unprecedented levels. In the past week, spot Ethereum ETFs saw $2.18 billion in net inflows last week, which is the highest weekly inflow the products have ever recorded. This surge underscores the growing confidence institutional investors have in Ethereum’s long-term value, particularly as regulatory clarity improves and ETH cements its place as a core layer of infrastructure. Over 20% Weekly Gains Signal Strong Market Momentum As mentioned by Vincent on X, Ethereum has gained momentum, and trading between $3,100 and $3,600 at the time of the post, reflecting a 20% rally within a week. This surge is fueled by strong inflows into spot ETH ETFs and rising institutional demand, both of which are acting as major tailwinds for the asset. Related Reading: Ethereum Boom Or Bust? Daniel Yan Sounds Alarm On SBET The ETF data has confirmed rising interest, and shows over $2.1 billion flowed into spot ETFs last week. This surge marks one of the largest weekly inflows for ETH ETFs, reflecting a broader trend of capital rotation toward crypto contract platforms. BlackRock Ethereum Trust (ETHA) now holds an impressive $9.17 billion in assets, which is nearly half of all capital invested across Ethereum ETFs. Furthermore, the Regulatory developments are supportive. The recent GENIUS Act tightens Stablecoin oversight while reinforcing trust in ETH settlement infrastructure. This dual effect positions ETH as a more credible and robust network for institutional activity. ETH currently secures $76 billion in DeFi TVL and $128 billion in Stablecoin supply. On-chain signals show strength as Staking participation continues to rise, a sign of long-term confidence among holders. The futures open interest has reached a record of $51 billion. This reflects deep institutional engagement. Meanwhile, ETH supply is deflationary due to burns and staking. Finally, Vincent sees $4,000 ETH as the next resistance level and stated that May’s Pectra upgrade will improve smart accounts, staking UX, and L2 integration, which are bullish for utility and scalability.

2025-07-21 22:00:25+00:00,Bitcoin FOMO: Unveiling the Powerful Whale Effect on Crypto Markets,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin FOMO: Unveiling the Powerful Whale Effect on Crypto Markets Are you constantly tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market, wondering what truly drives those exhilarating surges and perplexing dips? In the fast-paced world of digital assets, understanding investor psychology is as crucial as analyzing charts. While many believe retail excitement fuels market rallies, a deeper look reveals a more nuanced truth. The phenomenon of Bitcoin FOMO , or Fear Of Missing Out, plays out differently depending on who is feeling it. For institutional investors, their FOMO can be a powerful catalyst, propelling markets to new heights, a stark contrast to the often ill-timed retail rush. Let’s dive into Santiment’s fascinating insights and uncover how these powerful market movers operate. Decoding the Dynamics: What is Bitcoin FOMO ? The term FOMO, or Fear Of Missing Out, is widely recognized in the investment world, signifying the anxiety that arises from the possibility of missing out on a profitable investment opportunity. In the context of Bitcoin, it’s the urge to buy into the market when prices are rapidly rising, driven by the fear that you’ll be left behind while others profit. However, Santiment, a leading on-chain analytics platform, highlights a critical distinction in how this emotion manifests across different investor groups. Whales vs. Retail: A Tale of Two FOMOs In the crypto lexicon, ‘whales’ refer to large-scale investors, often institutions or individuals holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. ‘Retail investors,’ on the other hand, are individual traders who typically invest smaller sums. Their approaches to Bitcoin FOMO and market participation couldn’t be more different: Whale-Driven FOMO: According to Santiment, institutional investors often follow momentum, particularly after significant price levels or new all-time highs are breached. Their FOMO isn’t about chasing small gains; it’s about strategically entering or adding to positions once a strong, validated trend is established. This calculated entry often acts as a significant boost to the market, providing the capital and confidence needed to sustain rallies. Retail-Driven FOMO: In contrast, retail investors, influenced by social media hype, news headlines, and emotional responses, often jump into the market during the peak of a rally. This behavior, while seemingly harmless, frequently signals the exhaustion of an uptrend. When the last retail buyer has entered, there’s often less new money to push prices higher, leading to a potential market correction or even the end of a bull run. This fundamental difference in behavior is crucial for understanding market cycles and making informed investment decisions. It’s not just about who feels the Bitcoin FOMO , but when and why they feel it. The Strategic Impact of Institutional Bitcoin FOMO Why does institutional FOMO have such a profound impact on the market? It boils down to several key factors: Factor Whale Impact Retail Impact Capital Deployment Massive capital injections can significantly move prices. Smaller individual investments have limited direct price impact. Market Validation Their entry validates a trend, attracting more institutional and sophisticated capital. Their entry often signifies peak euphoria, less new capital follows. Sophistication Often based on deep research, on-chain analysis, and long-term strategies. Often driven by emotion, social media trends, and short-term profit seeking. Liquidity Provision Can provide significant liquidity, making markets more robust. Can contribute to illiquidity and sudden price swings when panic selling. When Santiment observes whales accumulating or entering the market with strong conviction, especially after breaching significant price thresholds, it suggests a belief in sustained upward momentum. This kind of Bitcoin FOMO is not reckless; it’s a calculated move by entities with substantial resources and often, proprietary insights. Their participation can absorb selling pressure, drive up demand, and create a positive feedback loop that attracts further investment, pushing Bitcoin prices higher. Avoiding the Pitfalls of Retail Bitcoin FOMO : Actionable Insights Given the distinct impact of different types of FOMO, how can you navigate the market more effectively and avoid becoming another casualty of retail hype? Prioritize Data Over Hype: Instead of relying on social media sentiment, look to on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment. These tools provide insights into whale movements, exchange flows, and network activity, offering a clearer picture of underlying market health.

2025-07-21 22:15:44+00:00,U.S. customers can start trading CFTC-regulated perpetual futures on Coinbase,"Coinbase has just launched CFTC-compliant perpetual-style futures trading in the U.S. with nano Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) contracts being offered up first. The contracts will reportedly offer 24/7 trading, up to 10x leverage, no quarterly expiration, and fees as low as 0.02%, marking a significant step for regulated crypto derivatives in the U.S. Coinbase introduced 24/7 standard futures trading As things stand, derivatives make up over 75% of total crypto trading volume globally. However, for a long time, traders based in America had to put up with limited access due to fixed market hours and contract expiration policies. Coinbase ended that era with the introduction of 24/7 standard futures trading, which it launched in May, expanding on its earlier BTC and ETH offerings to cover SOL, XRP, and ADA. These contracts are USD-settled, with XRP futures representing 10,000 XRP per contract and nano SOL contracts recording strong trading volume at over 23,000 contracts daily. It has now followed that action up by enabling CFTC-compliant perpetual-style futures trading , which differ from the current offshore perpetuals that dominate global crypto derivatives markets but are not approved in the U.S. These new instruments are reportedly structured as long-dated futures with five-year expirations. They also boast a funding rate mechanism that accrues hourly and is settled twice daily, similar to the price dynamics of perpetual swaps.

2025-07-21 22:30:00+00:00,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 21 July – XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin","Crypto progenitor Bitcoin has once again defied market expectations, setting a fresh all-time high (ATH) price of $122,838 last Monday. This unprecedented milestone has firmly shifted trader sentiment towards bullishness. Meanwhile, top-performing altcoins and the best meme coins such as TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have each reached new multi-month highs recently, reinforcing confidence in their ongoing upward potential. With speculation mounting over a potential major bull run, investors are eyeing specific digital assets they believe could break past their previous peaks. Ripple (XRP): Standout Crypto Strengthening its Cross-Border Payment Dominance with Constant New Price Highs Ripple’s XRP continues to cement itself as a critical bridge between traditional banking and blockchain-based transfers. Recently, it set a new all-time high (ATH) for the first time in seven years, pipping its 2018 high watermark of $3.40 with a new historic high of $3.65 on July 18. At its current price of $3.62, it is now just a fifth of a percent from going even further. With near-instant global settlement at minimal fees, XRP has secured strong institutional adoption. The United Nations has even recognized its capacity to facilitate international payments without traditional intermediaries. Following a protracted legal battle, Ripple secured a pivotal victory in 2023 when a U.S. court determined its retail token sales were not securities transactions. By 2025, the SEC officially dropped the lawsuit, ending four years of uncertainty and solidifying XRP’s regulatory standing alongside other major altcoins. This legal clarity has boosted investor confidence, with XRP’s value surging by over 518% in the past year, vastly outpacing Bitcoin’s 76% gain over the same period. Its RSI sits at an overbought level of 86, which is scorching hot and suggests the token may be overpriced. Many investors are now taking profits following its near 56.5% rally in the past fortnight, again outpacing Bitcoin. That said, if it dips, it could find solid support at its former resistance level around $3.30. Earlier this year, a bullish flag pattern emerged, often a prelude to a bullish breakout, which suggests a potential move towards $4 by fall. Cardano ($ADA): Could This Green Ethereum Challenger Crypto Reach New Price Heights in 2025? Interest in Cardano ($ADA) continues to rise—as shown by its 57% rise in the last fortnight—driven by solid technicals and mounting institutional attention. Alongside XRP and Solana, ADA was mentioned by Donald Trump as a potential asset for inclusion in a proposed U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson in 2014, Cardano is known for its academic research-first development approach and eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model, which later inspired Ethereum’s own transition away from Proof-of-Work. With a current market cap of $33.1 billion, ADA would need to more than triple to overtake Solana and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. Over the past week, ADA has gained 23%, outperforming Bitcoin’s 8.1% rise during the same period. Analysts project that ADA could climb from its current price of $0.92 to nearly $2 by mid-year, with more bullish outlooks predicting a return to its September 2021 all-time high of $3.09—a level it remains 70.2% below. While recent price action formed a bullish flag pattern indicating further gains, ADA’s RSI has reached an overbought reading of 85, which is likely to prompt profit-taking and a slight dip to consolidate its recent gains. The next key resistance level is at $1.15, with firm support between $0.85 and $0.90. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Is the Original Meme Coin Ready to Hit $1? Dogecoin ($DOGE) started as a joke in 2013 but has evolved into a major meme token with a market cap exceeding $41.7 billion and a fiercely dedicated community. Its popularity surged in 2021, fuelled by endorsements from figures like Elon Musk, Gene Simmons, and Snoop Dogg. Fresh institutional interest in May reignited momentum, pushing DOGE towards $0.25. Currently trading near $0.2779, it has gained 10% overnight and 36% this week, outperforming Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Shiba Inu during that period, showing its tendency to multiply gains by the leading cryptocurrencies during bull cycles. Technical analysis indicates the uptrend may continue, with DOGE’s RSI rising to 85, which means the token is overbought and may dip slightly in the short term as traders cash in on recent gains. But if it can rally slightly further up to $0.3, it will have found a firm footing on a strong support level, so a run up to $0.50 by late summer is conceivable. Its utility is expanding as well, with Tesla accepting DOGE for merchandise and integrations from platforms such as PayPal and Revolut broadening real-world use cases.

Crypto progenitor Bitcoin has once again defied market expectations, setting a fresh all-time high (ATH) price of $122,838 last Monday. This unprecedented milestone has firmly shifted trader sentiment towards bullishness. Meanwhile, top-performing altcoins and the best meme coins such as TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have each reached new multi-month highs recently, reinforcing confidence in their ongoing upward potential. With speculation mounting over a potential major bull run, investors are eyeing specific digital assets they believe could break past their previous peaks. Ripple (XRP): Standout Crypto Strengthening its Cross-Border Payment Dominance with Constant New Price Highs Ripple’s XRP continues to cement itself as a critical bridge between traditional banking and blockchain-based transfers. Recently, it set a new all-time high (ATH) for the first time in seven years, pipping its 2018 high watermark of $3.40 with a new historic high of $3.65 on July 18. At its current price of $3.62, it is now just a fifth of a percent from going even further. With near-instant global settlement at minimal fees, XRP has secured strong institutional adoption. The United Nations has even recognized its capacity to facilitate international payments without traditional intermediaries. Following a protracted legal battle, Ripple secured a pivotal victory in 2023 when a U.S. court determined its retail token sales were not securities transactions. By 2025, the SEC officially dropped the lawsuit, ending four years of uncertainty and solidifying XRP’s regulatory standing alongside other major altcoins. This legal clarity has boosted investor confidence, with XRP’s value surging by over 518% in the past year, vastly outpacing Bitcoin’s 76% gain over the same period. Its RSI sits at an overbought level of 86, which is scorching hot and suggests the token may be overpriced. Many investors are now taking profits following its near 56.5% rally in the past fortnight, again outpacing Bitcoin. That said, if it dips, it could find solid support at its former resistance level around $3.30. Earlier this year, a bullish flag pattern emerged, often a prelude to a bullish breakout, which suggests a potential move towards $4 by fall.

2025-07-21 22:30:07+00:00,Bitcoin Buying Resumes Across All Wallet Sizes—Even Mega Whales Are Back In,"On-chain data shows every major Bitcoin cohort is now aligned in behavior, with accumulation being dominant across the network. Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score Is Hinting At Market-Wide Buying In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has shared about how the behavior of the various Bitcoin cohorts has looked from the perspective of the Accumulation Trend Score recently. The Accumulation Trend Score is an indicator that tells us about whether the BTC investors are accumulating or distributing. The metric takes into account two factors when calculating its value: the balance changes happening in the wallets of the holders and the size of the wallets themselves. The second weighting factor means that larger entities have a larger influence on the score. The metric’s value can lie between 0 and 1, with the two extremes corresponding to perfect behaviors of accumulation and distribution, respectively. The 0.5 mark acts as the boundary between the two types of behaviors. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score for different segments of the network over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Accumulation Trend Score was showing mixed behavior across the investor cohorts earlier, implying the holders were divided on the cryptocurrency’s outcome. Recently, however, a shift has occurred, with all investor groups showing some degree of accumulation. Three cohorts in particular stand out for their aggression: shrimps, whales, and mega whales. The shrimps, investors with less than 1 BTC, were showing light distribution before the latest rally, but following it, they have changed their tune and started showing aggressive accumulation instead. The whales, holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, were already buying with conviction when the rest of the market was unclear, and they have only continued this trend since the new all-time high (ATH) in the asset. Finally, the largest of holders on the network, those with more than 10,000 BTC, have broken a distribution streak to show levels of buying not seen since December 2024. “The alignment across wallet sizes suggests broad-based conviction behind the current BTC uptrend,” notes Glassnode. While the investors as a whole have been buying, it’s not like there hasn’t been any selling done at all. One group that has been responsible for distribution in the latest leg of the rally has been the miners , according to data from analytics firm CryptoQuant . As is visible in the left chart, Bitcoin miners made a significant amount withdrawals from their wallets recently. What they wanted to do with these coins may be answered by the second graph, which shows most of the 16,000 BTC outflow went to centralized exchanges. Miners deposit to these platforms when they want to sell, so this withdrawal spree could be an indication that this cohort took advantage of the rally to take profits.

2025-07-21 23:15:13+00:00,Over 90% of ETH holders are in profit after recent surge in value,"More than 90% of ETH holders are now in profit after the token’s recent rally saw it hit $3,800 for the first time in over a year. Data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) confirmed this, noting that it is the highest level since December 2024. According to the data , only a few addresses have bought ETH above its current price, which means that on-chain resistance above that price point has been very light, a factor that could push the token to further heights. The sizable amount of holders in profit highlights the turnaround that ETH has experienced over the past few months. Per CoinMarketCap, the ETH value has increased by more than 120% in the last three months, going from around $1,800 to $3,800. The majority of ETH holders are now in profit (Source: Sentora) With the gains, concerns about ETH value, which dominated sentiments in the Ethereum community during the first half of the year, have faded away completely, replaced by bullish sentiments that the asset could hit a new all-time high. However, the token has seen a slight decline today, falling less than 1% in what appears to be a minimal price correction even as it remains primed for further gains. Despite the price correction, the general opinion remains bullish for ETH with analysts from Sentora noting that the first major resistance for ETH is slightly below $4,000, as 2.39 million addresses are holding at a loss in this range. Institutions and retail pile on ETH as interest increases With the ETH price increasing, demand for the token has also been soaring, with institutions and retail investors buying the token. Over the past few months, several public companies have accumulated billions worth of ETH for their treasuries. Interestingly, retail investors are also not holding back. Santiment data noted that social media discussion around ETH is now at levels similar to its price rise in May 2024. Ethereum now has over 152 million non-empty ETH wallets, the highest for any crypto token. First-time ETH buyers are increasing (Source: Glassnode) It appears that first-time buyers are also increasing their interest in the asset. According to Glassnode data, the supply of ETH held by first-time buyers has increased by 16% since early July, showing the return of new market participants and the injection of fresh capital. Altcoin season is entering full swing Meanwhile, ETH’s massive performance over the past three months appears to have kick-started the altcoin season, with several tokens now seeing a surge in their value. In the past 24 hours, major cap altcoins such as Solana and Dogecoin have seen 7.74% and 6.70% gains, respectively. Santiment data highlighted other top performers, noting that PENGU gained 16%, HEX increased by 20%, PLSX 12% while KAS went up by 15%. Analysts note that this is the Bitcoin all-time high profits redistribution in full effect. Interestingly, BTC is showing consolidation signs with the flagship asset declining more than 2% in the past seven days and now trading in the $118,000 range. On-chain indicators also show slower inflows and rising transfer volume. With altcoins, led by Ether, soaring in value, Bitcoin dominance has also declined to 59.67%, its lowest level since March 2025 and far from the 65% less than 30 days ago. By comparison, ETH’s dominance at 11.58% has been at its highest level since January 2025. Despite the gains, the altcoin season is yet to enter full effect. According to CoinMarketCap Altcoin Season Index, it is currently at 55/100, which means 56% of the top 100 tokens have outperformed Bitcoin in the last 90 days. Altcoin season signal is when 75% of the top 100 coins outperform BTC. Nevertheless, the signs are already there with altcoin activity soaring. Data from CryptoQuant shows that altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures increased to $100.7 billion in a single day, marking the highest level since February 2025.

More than 90% of ETH holders are now in profit after the token’s recent rally saw it hit $3,800 for the first time in over a year. Data from Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) confirmed this, noting that it is the highest level since December 2024. According to the data , only a few addresses have bought ETH above its current price, which means that on-chain resistance above that price point has been very light, a factor that could push the token to further heights. The sizable amount of holders in profit highlights the turnaround that ETH has experienced over the past few months. Per CoinMarketCap, the ETH value has increased by more than 120% in the last three months, going from around $1,800 to $3,800. The majority of ETH holders are now in profit (Source: Sentora) With the gains, concerns about ETH value, which dominated sentiments in the Ethereum community during the first half of the year, have faded away completely, replaced by bullish sentiments that the asset could hit a new all-time high. However, the token has seen a slight decline today, falling less than 1% in what appears to be a minimal price correction even as it remains primed for further gains. Despite the price correction, the general opinion remains bullish for ETH with analysts from Sentora noting that the first major resistance for ETH is slightly below $4,000, as 2.39 million addresses are holding at a loss in this range. Institutions and retail pile on ETH as interest increases With the ETH price increasing, demand for the token has also been soaring, with institutions and retail investors buying the token. Over the past few months, several public companies have accumulated billions worth of ETH for their treasuries. Interestingly, retail investors are also not holding back. Santiment data noted that social media discussion around ETH is now at levels similar to its price rise in May 2024. Ethereum now has over 152 million non-empty ETH wallets, the highest for any crypto token. First-time ETH buyers are increasing (Source: Glassnode) It appears that first-time buyers are also increasing their interest in the asset. According to Glassnode data, the supply of ETH held by first-time buyers has increased by 16% since early July, showing the return of new market participants and the injection of fresh capital.

2025-07-21 23:30:16+00:00,Crypto Enthusiast Asks XRP Holders This Critical Question,"With XRP currently trading at $3.55 , discussions around how much of the token one needs to retire are gaining renewed attention across the crypto community. Investors are increasingly revisiting questions about what size of XRP holdings could support long-term financial independence, particularly as speculation continues about the token’s future valuation. The conversation, primarily fueled by retail investors within the XRP Army, centers around the belief that XRP could see exponential growth in the coming years. For many, even a small number of tokens could potentially yield significant wealth if bullish projections are realized. Community Perspectives on Retirement Thresholds A recent discussion led by a known figure in the XRP community, Jeremiah, asked members to share their thoughts on the number of tokens they believe would be sufficient for retirement. The responses highlighted a wide range of perspectives, with opinions varying from conservative estimates to highly ambitious predictions. How much XRP do you think is needed to retire comfortably? I am curious to see what you think. #XRP pic.twitter.com/EF1tu9s37Y — GenXRP (@JeremiahB45) July 20, 2025 Some users suggested that owning 10,000 XRP could provide a path to financial security, implying expectations that the token could rise to values exceeding $100. Others proposed that 60,000 XRP would be a safer benchmark, though Jeremiah challenged this, asserting that a smaller quantity might be sufficient due to future market dynamics. Another user took an even more optimistic position, arguing that as little as 1,000 XRP could eventually be enough to retire. Jeremiah reiterated this sentiment, citing anticipated reductions in available supply over the next five years as a potential driver of significant price increases. High-Value Projections Stir Debate Perhaps the most striking claim came from a community member named Marc, who proposed that just 100 XRP could be sufficient for a comfortable retirement. Jeremiah supported this assertion, reinforcing a highly optimistic outlook. For this scenario to materialize, XRP would need to exceed $10,000 per token, an increase of over 285,000% from its current price. Although these projections are met with skepticism even within the XRP community, some well-known figures have shared similar views. For instance, crypto entrepreneur Jake Claver has suggested that XRP could reach $10,000 by 2027. Nonetheless, such projections are controversial and far from consensus.

O ne user compared the current situation to the evolution of Bitcoin, noting that what once seemed like a sufficient amount for retirement has changed over time as the asset matured. These perspectives reflect a broader understanding that price predictions must be grounded in market fundamentals, rather than speculation alone. Although there is no clear consensus on the exact amount of XRP needed to achieve financial independence, confidence in the token’s long-term potential remains high among supporters.

2025-07-21 23:45:19+00:00,"Ethereum Shatters Inflow Records, Pulls in $2.12 Billion in a Week","Ethereum led digital asset inflows last week as it recorded a staggering $2.12 billion. The figure was nearly double its previous record. This surge helped push total digital asset investment product inflows to an all-time weekly high of $4.39 billion, surpassing the prior record of $4.27 billion set after the US presidential election in December 2024. Altcoins Join Ethereum’s Rally In the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,’ CoinShares revealed that Ethereum has been on a strong run. Inflows from the past 13 weeks now account for 23% of its total assets under management. This year alone, it has pulled in $6.2 billion and has already topped the full-year inflows seen in 2024. This comes as total assets under management hit a record $220 billion, while global weekly trading turnover in ETPs also reached a record $39.2 billion. Bitcoin attracted $2.2 billion in inflows this week, down from last week’s $2.7 billion. ETP trading volumes accounted for 55% of its exchange activity. Meanwhile, Solana led altcoin inflows with $39 million, followed by XRP at $36 million and Sui at $9.3 million. During the same period, Chainlink and Cardano recorded smaller inflows of $0.9 million and $0.3 million. Multi-asset products were the only cohort to have recorded outflows of $16.4 million over the past week. With altcoins pulling notable inflows, the data indicates growing investor appetite for assets beyond Bitcoin. In fact, QCP Capital noted that Bitcoin dominance slipped from 64% to 60% over the past week, while, at the same time, Ethereum’s market share rose from 9.7% to 11.6%. If this trend continues, QCP expects the next phase of altcoin season could already be underway.

Switzerland followed with $47.3 million, while Australia and Hong Kong recorded $17.3 million and $14.1 million, respectively. Canada also saw modest inflows of $3 million.

In November of 2024, analyst Benjamin Cowen predicted that Ethereum would “come home” or drop to its logarithmic growth trendline based on historical patterns. In April of this year, Ethereum fell to around $1,550, prompting Cowen to declare that ETH had come home. Source: Benjamin Cowen/X Now, Cowen says that Ethereum rallies will be partly fueled by capital rotation from altcoins to ETH. “If you bought ETH when it went home and feel like you are missing out on ALT rallies, consider this: The collective altcoin market is down 40% against ETH since ETH went home. We are at the: ‘Yes your alt went up, but does it bleed against Ethereum’ phase of the cycle… When ALTs bleed to BTC, be in BTC over ALTs. When ALTs bleed to ETH, be in ETH over ALTs. It’s not that complicated.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/X The analyst also believes that Ethereum has a solid shot at printing new all-time highs once it takes out a resistance level that has kept the market bearish since December 2021. “Since ETH went home, the next time it reaches $4,000, there is a good chance it actually breaks through. One way for this cycle to feel more complete is for ETH to rally to new highs sometime over the next half-year.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/X At time of writing, Ethereum is worth $3,725.

2025-07-22 00:25:24+00:00,Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 72: Unveiling Market Optimism,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index Soars to 72: Unveiling Market Optimism Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto air? The digital asset market is once again capturing attention, and a key indicator, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , has recently climbed to a notable 72. This significant jump places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, signaling a palpable shift in investor sentiment. But what exactly does this mean for you, and how should you interpret this exciting yet potentially volatile development? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does It Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, is more than just a number; it’s a barometer for the collective emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 (extreme fear) to 100 (extreme greed), it aims to help investors understand whether the market is overly fearful – which could present a buying opportunity – or overly greedy – which might indicate a looming correction. On July 22, the index registered 72, a slight increase from the previous day, solidifying its position within the ‘Greed’ territory. Why is this index so important? Because human emotions often drive financial markets. Fear can lead to irrational selling, while greed can fuel impulsive buying, often at inflated prices. By quantifying these emotions, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a valuable perspective, helping traders and investors make more informed decisions rather than succumbing to the whims of the crowd. It serves as a psychological pulse check for the dynamic world of digital assets. Ignoring such indicators can lead to impulsive decisions, making the index a crucial tool for anyone navigating the crypto landscape. How Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Work? Decoding Its Components Understanding how the Crypto Fear & Greed Index arrives at its score is crucial for appreciating its insights. It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of various market factors, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall sentiment. Here’s a breakdown of the six core components that contribute to its calculation: Factor Weight What It Measures Volatility 25% Current Bitcoin volatility vs. average (30/90 days). High volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Current trading volume and momentum. High buying volume signals greed. Social Media 15% Analysis of crypto-related keywords and sentiment on platforms like Twitter. Positive sentiment indicates greed. Surveys (Paused) 15% Public opinion polls on market sentiment. (Currently paused) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Bitcoin’s market cap share. Increasing dominance can signal fear (move to safety). Google Trends 10% Search queries for crypto terms. Fearful searches vs. curious/buying interest searches. By combining these diverse data points, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a holistic view of market psychology, moving beyond simple price action to capture the underlying sentiment. This multi-faceted approach ensures a more robust and reliable indicator for crypto enthusiasts. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Opportunities and Risks for Crypto Fear & Greed Index Observers The current reading of 72 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index firmly places us in the ‘Greed’ zone. For many, this signals a bullish market where prices are rising, and optimism abounds. It can indeed present opportunities for those looking to capitalize on upward momentum. However, it’s crucial to approach this period with a balanced perspective, recognizing both the potential rewards and inherent risks. Opportunities in a ‘Greed’ Market: Potential for Further Gains: When sentiment is strong, prices can continue to climb as more investors enter the market, driven by positive news and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This can be a lucrative period for existing holders. Increased Liquidity: Higher trading volumes often accompany periods of greed, making it easier to buy and sell assets without significant price impact. This allows for smoother transactions and better execution of trades. Altcoin Season Potential: Sometimes, strong Bitcoin performance, which contributes to the index, can eventually spill over into altcoins, leading to broader market rallies. This can create diverse opportunities beyond just Bitcoin. Risks in a ‘Greed’ Market: Overvaluation: Periods of extreme greed can lead to assets becoming overvalued, creating bubbles that are unsustainable in the long run. This increases the risk of sharp price corrections. Increased Volatility: While greed can drive prices up, it can also lead to sharp corrections as sentiment can turn quickly. What goes up fast can come down even faster, catching unprepared investors off guard. FOMO-Driven Decisions: The psychological pressure to join a rising market can lead investors to make impulsive decisions, buying assets without proper research or at unsustainable prices.

2025-07-22 00:30:44+00:00,"Peter Schiff urges ETH-to-BTC swap as Ethereum hits $3,700","Controversial economist and known crypto critic Peter Schiff has rekindled the Bitcoin vs. Ethereum debate in a tweet encouraging investors to ditch the latter and invest in the former instead. This comes after the price of ETH broke through its previous peak at $3,700, a new milestone since January 2024 on the back of healthy institutional inflows and a resurgence in market confidence. In an X post , Schiff cautioned that testing the waters for Ethereum would be pointless, as it would just be another phony bubble amid a greater bear market against Bitcoin. He wrote, “Ether is back near the upper end of its trading range again. If you own any, this is a great time to sell. As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether.” . Bitcoin was the superior trade because Ethereum tended to follow, he said. Schiff said he used his head, not his heart or gut, to analyze charts. In response to his critics, he clarified that he was also bearish on Bitcoin and thought Ethereum was even more structurally unsound as more competitors entered the smart contract and decentralized finance (DeFi) spaces. He contended that Ethereum no longer had a utility monopoly; meanwhile, despite its faults, Bitcoin had retained the perception of digital gold. He felt that Ethereum’s narrative and use case were getting diluted. Ethereum surges on ETF inflows and corporate DeFi deals Unlike Schiff’s onslaught, the latest rip on Ether results from strong play in the crypto space. ETH rallied over $3,700 amid record inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs. These products are a magnet for large institutional investors who consider Ether a credible investment to earn a return on. The token has surged more than 25% over the past week, driven higher by both technical momentum and a bit of fundamental news. Ethereum has been flat over the past year, gaining just 7% in the recent trend of Ether’s price, a sign that growth is accelerating. Public companies have been part of the problem, too. BitMine and SharpLink Gaming are the latest companies to join the game of corporate Ether treasuries . Even more impressive, SharpLink has well over 1B in ETH alone, and they have publicly stated they will stake and run in support of the network to generate passive income. Those kinds of moves suggest that institutions increasingly believe in Ethereum’s long-term prospects even as Bitcoin skeptics like Schiff continue to wonder whether it has legs. Crypto fans fire back at Schiff The crypto community fired back at Schiff’s claims. SharpLink Gaming, one of the companies with large ETH reserves, even edited Schiff’s original X post to advocate for staking Ethereum instead of dumping positions. The shift rebutted and offered a savvy sales pitch for their treasury strategy. Analyst Benjamin Cowen also chipped in on the subject through a long ETH/BTC market chart tweet. He went on to claim that Schiff’s warning was a case of too little too late, adding that the Ethereum-to-Bitcoin ratio probably had already bottomed before Schiff made his comments. Schiff has made waves in the crypto world before. A staunch backer of gold and critic of digital currencies, he has often been at loggerheads with the crypto community.

2025-07-22 00:40:19+00:00,Altcoin Season Unleashed: Index Hits 55 Signaling Explosive Market Growth,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Unleashed: Index Hits 55 Signaling Explosive Market Growth Are you ready for a potential shift in the crypto winds? The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as a significant metric, the Altcoin Season Index, has climbed to a notable 55. This upward movement suggests that we might be deep into what enthusiasts call ‘Altcoin Season’ – a period where alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, steal the spotlight from Bitcoin. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? To truly understand the current market dynamics, it’s crucial to grasp the concept of the Altcoin Season Index. This metric, meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a leading cryptocurrency price data platform, provides a snapshot of the market’s sentiment and performance. It’s not just a random number; it’s a calculated indicator designed to show whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin. The Core Rule: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Inverse: Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same period, the market is considered to be in ‘Bitcoin Season’. The Scale: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. A higher number indicates stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Exclusions: It’s important to note that the index intelligently filters out stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to ensure the data accurately reflects the performance of genuine, volatile altcoins. Decoding the Current Altcoin Season: What Does an Index of 55 Mean? The recent jump of the Altcoin Season Index to 55 at 00:30 UTC on July 22, up two points from the previous day, is a significant signal. While 75 is the threshold for an official Altcoin Season, an index of 55 indicates a strong inclination towards altcoin outperformance. It suggests that a substantial portion of the top 100 altcoins are currently showing more robust gains compared to Bitcoin over the last three months. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it reflects a sustained trend where capital might be rotating from Bitcoin into various altcoins, seeking potentially higher returns. Historically, an index around this level often precedes or accompanies periods of heightened activity and interest in the broader altcoin market. It signifies that investors are increasingly confident in the potential of projects beyond Bitcoin, exploring opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Layer-1 solutions, and various other emerging sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season: A Clear Distinction Understanding the difference between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is fundamental for any crypto investor. These are not just arbitrary terms; they represent distinct phases in the market cycle, each with its own characteristics and opportunities. Feature Altcoin Season Bitcoin Season Dominance Altcoins collectively gain market share; Bitcoin dominance often declines. Bitcoin gains market share; altcoins may consolidate or decline against BTC. Performance Metric 75%+ of top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. 25%- of top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Capital Flow Capital often rotates from Bitcoin into various altcoins. Capital often flows into Bitcoin, seen as a safer or primary asset. Risk/Reward Higher potential for exponential gains, but also higher volatility and risk. Generally lower volatility compared to altcoins, steady growth. These cycles are natural in the crypto market, often driven by shifts in investor sentiment, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors. Understanding which ‘season’ the market is in can help investors adjust their strategies accordingly. What Fuels an Altcoin Season? Understanding the Drivers Behind the Surge Several catalysts typically converge to ignite an Altcoin Season . It’s rarely a single factor but rather a combination of developments that shift investor focus from Bitcoin to the broader altcoin market: Bitcoin Dominance Cycle: Often, after a strong Bitcoin bull run, investors look to diversify gains into altcoins. As Bitcoin’s dominance (its market cap percentage of the total crypto market) peaks and begins to decline, capital flows into altcoins, pushing their prices up.

BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season Unleashed: Index Hits 55 Signaling Explosive Market Growth Are you ready for a potential shift in the crypto winds? The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with excitement as a significant metric, the Altcoin Season Index, has climbed to a notable 55. This upward movement suggests that we might be deep into what enthusiasts call ‘Altcoin Season’ – a period where alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, steal the spotlight from Bitcoin. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? To truly understand the current market dynamics, it’s crucial to grasp the concept of the Altcoin Season Index. This metric, meticulously tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), a leading cryptocurrency price data platform, provides a snapshot of the market’s sentiment and performance. It’s not just a random number; it’s a calculated indicator designed to show whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin. The Core Rule: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season , at least 75% of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. The Inverse: Conversely, if 25% or fewer of these top 100 coins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same period, the market is considered to be in ‘Bitcoin Season’. The Scale: The index operates on a scale from 1 to 100. A higher number indicates stronger altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin. Exclusions: It’s important to note that the index intelligently filters out stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) to ensure the data accurately reflects the performance of genuine, volatile altcoins. Decoding the Current Altcoin Season: What Does an Index of 55 Mean? The recent jump of the Altcoin Season Index to 55 at 00:30 UTC on July 22, up two points from the previous day, is a significant signal. While 75 is the threshold for an official Altcoin Season, an index of 55 indicates a strong inclination towards altcoin outperformance. It suggests that a substantial portion of the top 100 altcoins are currently showing more robust gains compared to Bitcoin over the last three months. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it reflects a sustained trend where capital might be rotating from Bitcoin into various altcoins, seeking potentially higher returns. Historically, an index around this level often precedes or accompanies periods of heightened activity and interest in the broader altcoin market. It signifies that investors are increasingly confident in the potential of projects beyond Bitcoin, exploring opportunities in decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Layer-1 solutions, and various other emerging sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Altcoin Season vs. Bitcoin Season: A Clear Distinction Understanding the difference between Altcoin Season and Bitcoin Season is fundamental for any crypto investor. These are not just arbitrary terms; they represent distinct phases in the market cycle, each with its own characteristics and opportunities. Feature Altcoin Season Bitcoin Season Dominance Altcoins collectively gain market share; Bitcoin dominance often declines. Bitcoin gains market share; altcoins may consolidate or decline against BTC. Performance Metric 75%+ of top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. 25%- of top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Capital Flow Capital often rotates from Bitcoin into various altcoins. Capital often flows into Bitcoin, seen as a safer or primary asset. Risk/Reward Higher potential for exponential gains, but also higher volatility and risk. Generally lower volatility compared to altcoins, steady growth. These cycles are natural in the crypto market, often driven by shifts in investor sentiment, technological advancements, and macroeconomic factors. Understanding which ‘season’ the market is in can help investors adjust their strategies accordingly. What Fuels an Altcoin Season? Understanding the Drivers Behind the Surge Several catalysts typically converge to ignite an Altcoin Season . It’s rarely a single factor but rather a combination of developments that shift investor focus from Bitcoin to the broader altcoin market: Bitcoin Dominance Cycle: Often, after a strong Bitcoin bull run, investors look to diversify gains into altcoins. As Bitcoin’s dominance (its market cap percentage of the total crypto market) peaks and begins to decline, capital flows into altcoins, pushing their prices up. Technological Innovation and Development: Significant upgrades or new features on major altcoin networks (e.g., Ethereum’s upgrades, Solana’s scaling solutions, new DeFi protocols) can attract immense interest and investment. These advancements promise improved utility, lower fees, or greater decentralization. Emergence of New Narratives: The crypto space is highly narrative-driven. Trends like Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Web3 gaming, Layer-2 solutions, and Real World Assets (RWAs) can create immense hype"

2025-07-22 01:00:24+00:00,Ethereum Open Interest Explodes To $28 Billion—Altcoin Rotation Begins: QCP,"Ethereum’s derivatives market has erupted in the past seven days, and the trading desk at Singapore-based QCP Capital argues it is the clearest evidence yet that a long-anticipated altcoin season is finally under way. In a note to clients on Monday, the firm says total perpetual open interest (OI) in ether futures has vaulted from “under $18 billion to more than $28 billion in just a week,” a jump large enough to drag the composite “altcoin-season index” above the critical 50-point threshold for the first time since December. Altcoin Season Ignites As Ethereum Outpaces BTC While it’s no surprise that retail may be chasing the momentum, it’s becoming increasingly clear that institutions are leading the charge this cycle, driven by a shift in narratives and structural developments,” QCP writes, pointing to the unusually large sizing of recent block trades on CME and Binance. Related Reading: Ethereum Set To Hit $10,000, Elliott Wave Analysis Predicts QCP singles out last Friday’s signing of the GENIUS Act as the pivotal spark behind the rotation. The law creates a comprehensive federal regime for dollar-backed stablecoins, forcing issuers to hold 100 percent short-term Treasury or cash reserves and submit to Bank Secrecy Act oversight. The White House cast the statute as “historic legislation that will pave the way for the United States to lead the global digital-currency revolution.” With regulatory clarity finally in hand, corporate treasuries “are racing to build their stockpile,” QCP says, treating ether and other smart-contract platforms—Solana, XRP Ledger and Cardano among them—as the infrastructure layer that will benefit most from an explosion in stablecoin issuance. The desk compares the emerging strategy to the hard-money playbook adopted by publicly listed bitcoin bellwethers such as MicroStrategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. The note argues that the policy tailwind is already reshaping capital flows. Spot ether ETFs attracted $602 million on July 17, out-pulling bitcoin ETFs’ $522 million and marking the first daily flow victory for ETH in the eighteen-month history of US crypto ETPs. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust recorded the single largest subscription and, according to QCP, is “broadcasting confidence” that its pending amendment to allow on-chain staking will secure SEC approval later this year. Industry analysts concur: the agency is widely expected to rule on the batch of staking amendments before year-end despite BlackRock’s late filing. Related Reading: Tom Lee Predicts $30,000 Per Ethereum As Treasury Frenzy Begins Derivatives positioning mirrors the spot-market exuberance. QCP highlights “aggressive” demand for out-of-the-money call spreads such as the ETH-26 Sep 25 $3,400/3,800 and ETH-26 Dec 25 $3,500/4,500 structures, along with a persistent bid for call-side risk reversals across all listed tenors. Implied volatility skews now favour calls by their widest margin since the April 2024 meme-coin frenzy, signalling traders’ willingness to pay up for upside exposure through the fourth quarter—precisely the window in which ETF staking approval could drop. The Ether surge has already carved four percentage points out of bitcoin’s market-share lead, driving BTC dominance down to 60 percent while lifting ETH’s share from 9.7 percent to 11.6 percent, QCP notes. If that trend holds—and the firm stresses that sustained follow-through in the options market is a key litmus test—“the next leg of altcoin season may already be in motion.” For now, QCP is monitoring three metrics: perpetual OI growth, the altcoin-season index, and relative ETF flows. A decisive break of bitcoin above $121,000 could delay rotation, the desk concedes, but the structural forces unleashed by the GENIUS Act and the prospect of yield-bearing ether ETFs give institutions a tangible reason to diversify. As QCP puts it, “we’ll be watching these signals closely—and if anything else confirms the thesis, you’ll be the first to know.” At press time, ETH traded at $3,846.

2025-07-22 01:45:24+00:00,Volcon Bitcoin: Nasdaq-Listed Company Makes Bold 280 BTC Acquisition,"BitcoinWorld Volcon Bitcoin: Nasdaq-Listed Company Makes Bold 280 BTC Acquisition In a significant development that underscores the accelerating integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance, Nasdaq-listed Volcon, an innovative all-electric power sports company, has made headlines with its substantial Volcon Bitcoin acquisition. This strategic move, which sees the firm now holding a considerable amount of Bitcoin, is not merely a financial transaction but a bold statement about the evolving landscape of corporate treasury management and the growing confidence in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. For those keenly observing the intersection of traditional markets and digital innovation, Volcon’s decision marks a pivotal moment. What’s Driving Volcon’s Bold Bitcoin Move? Volcon, renowned for its cutting-edge electric motorcycles and utility terrain vehicles, has officially disclosed its impressive Volcon Bitcoin holdings, totaling 280.14 BTC. A significant portion of this acquisition, specifically 235.83 BTC, was secured through cash subscriptions, as initially reported by Business Wire. This announcement confirms the company’s previously stated intentions to allocate a substantial part of its capital raise towards digital assets. Earlier, Volcon had unveiled ambitious plans to raise $500 million through a private placement.

How Did Volcon Secure Its Bitcoin Holdings? The details of Volcon’s acquisition method are particularly insightful. The company secured a significant portion of its Volcon Bitcoin through ‘cash subscriptions,’ which refers to funds raised directly from investors who subscribe to new shares or other securities. This aligns with their prior announcement of a $500 million private placement.

This method allows companies to raise capital quickly and efficiently, often from institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals, without the extensive regulatory requirements of a public offering.

BitcoinWorld Volcon Bitcoin: Nasdaq-Listed Company Makes Bold 280 BTC Acquisition In a significant development that underscores the accelerating integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance, Nasdaq-listed Volcon, an innovative all-electric power sports company, has made headlines with its substantial Volcon Bitcoin acquisition. This strategic move, which sees the firm now holding a considerable amount of Bitcoin, is not merely a financial transaction but a bold statement about the evolving landscape of corporate treasury management and the growing confidence in cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class. For those keenly observing the intersection of traditional markets and digital innovation, Volcon’s decision marks a pivotal moment. What’s Driving Volcon’s Bold Bitcoin Move? Volcon, renowned for its cutting-edge electric motorcycles and utility terrain vehicles, has officially disclosed its impressive Volcon Bitcoin holdings, totaling 280.14 BTC. A significant portion of this acquisition, specifically 235.83 BTC, was secured through cash subscriptions, as initially reported by Business Wire. This announcement confirms the company’s previously stated intentions to allocate a substantial part of its capital raise towards digital assets.

Among these, the movements of a “whale” – an investor holding a substantial amount of digital assets – are arguably the most captivating. These colossal transactions can send ripples across the market, offering glimpses into the strategies of the biggest players. Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a significant WBTC whale making a remarkable move, offloading a massive portion of their holdings and securing an extraordinary profit. What does this mean for the market, and what can we learn from such a calculated maneuver? Unpacking the WBTC Whale’s Epic Sale: What Exactly Happened? Over a concise period of just three days, an anonymous address, identified by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X , executed a strategic sale of 700 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). This substantial offload amounted to a staggering $82.4 million. The scale of this transaction immediately caught the eye of market observers, highlighting the significant influence a single WBTC whale can wield. The history behind this particular whale’s holdings adds another layer of intrigue. This address acquired 1,074 WBTC approximately four years ago, at an average cost of $10,708 per coin. This long-term holding strategy, spanning several market cycles, positioned the whale perfectly for the recent bull run. Let’s look at the numbers: Metric Details Amount Sold 700 WBTC Sale Value $82.4 million Purchase Amount 1,074 WBTC Average Purchase Price $10,708 per WBTC Estimated Profit $74.89 million Remaining Holdings 800 WBTC The estimated profit of $74.89 million from this partial sale is a testament to the power of long-term conviction and timely profit-taking in the crypto market. Even after this significant divestment, the WBTC whale still retains a substantial holding of 800 WBTC, indicating continued confidence or perhaps a strategy to re-enter at lower prices or hold for further appreciation. Understanding WBTC: Why is it Crucial for a WBTC Whale? Before diving deeper into the implications of this transaction, it’s important to understand what WBTC is and why it’s a preferred asset for large holders, including our mystery WBTC whale . WBTC, or Wrapped Bitcoin, is an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 by Bitcoin. This means that for every WBTC in circulation, there is one Bitcoin held in reserve by a custodian. The primary reason for WBTC’s existence is to bring Bitcoin’s liquidity to the Ethereum blockchain. This allows Bitcoin holders to participate in Ethereum’s vibrant decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, which includes lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), without having to sell their Bitcoin. For a large holder, like a WBTC whale , this offers several strategic advantages: Interoperability: It bridges the two largest blockchain ecosystems, allowing Bitcoin to be used in Ethereum-based applications. DeFi Participation: WBTC enables participation in yield farming, liquidity provision, and other DeFi protocols to earn additional returns on Bitcoin holdings. Speed and Cost: Transactions on Ethereum can be faster and sometimes cheaper for certain operations compared to native Bitcoin transactions, especially when interacting with smart contracts. Programmability: As an ERC-20 token, WBTC inherits the programmability of Ethereum, opening up possibilities for complex financial strategies. Therefore, holding WBTC provides the benefits of Bitcoin’s value appreciation combined with the flexibility and utility of the Ethereum network. This dual advantage makes it an attractive asset for large-scale investors looking to maximize their capital efficiency across different blockchain environments. What Motivates a WBTC Whale to Make Such a Move? The decision by a WBTC whale to offload $82.4 million worth of assets is rarely arbitrary. Such moves are typically the result of careful calculation and strategic planning. While we can only speculate on the exact motivations of this particular whale, common reasons for such large-scale sales include: Profit-Taking: As seen in this case, a substantial profit of nearly $75 million is a compelling reason to sell. After a significant price run, whales often de-risk by taking profits, securing gains, and reducing exposure to potential market downturns. Portfolio Rebalancing: Whales often manage diverse portfolios. A sale of WBTC might be part of a broader strategy to rebalance their holdings, perhaps shifting capital into other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, or even traditional assets, to optimize risk-reward ratios. Market Sentiment and Outlook: Large investors closely monitor market sentiment, technical indicators, and macroeconomic factors. A sale could indicate a belief that the market is nearing a local top, or that a correction is imminent, prompting them to sell before a potential dip.

2025-07-22 02:30:37+00:00,Bitcoin’s UTXO Count Falls Sharply — Are Whales Prepping for a Big Move?,"Bitcoin’s upward price trajectory has slightly cooled, with the asset now trading just below the $119,000 mark, reflecting a 3% decline over the past week. The dip follows a sustained upward trend that has seen significant interest from both institutional and retail participants in recent months. The current pause in momentum may suggest a temporary rebalancing, with market participants potentially reassessing their positions. As price movement stabilizes, on-chain analysts have begun to highlight deeper structural shifts within Bitcoin’s blockchain activity. According to CryptoQuant contributor Avocado onchain, one key trend gaining attention is the continued decline in Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) count. While at first glance this might seem related to falling transaction volumes, the underlying cause points to a more strategic restructuring by institutional participants. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Metrics Flash Mixed Signals: Monthly Inflows Rise And Daily Outflows Start Slowing Institutional Consolidation Reshaping On-Chain Structure Avocado explained that since December 2024, Bitcoin’s UTXO count has steadily decreased, a development he attributes to growing over-the-counter (OTC) activity and consolidation efforts by large holders. These entities, primarily whales and institutional investors, are reportedly merging multiple UTXOs into fewer addresses, a process that increases on-chain efficiency and reflects a preference for long-term custody. “The post-ETF approval environment has driven more assets into secure wallets, moving funds off exchanges into institutional-grade custody,” he wrote. This structural shift suggests that long-term holders are preparing for extended exposure rather than immediate market participation. Instead of dispersing funds for frequent trades, these institutions are consolidating their Bitcoin holdings into larger ones, indicating reduced near-term liquidity but possibly greater long-term market stability. The impact is visible in the on-chain footprint, where the number of active UTXOs has not kept pace with prior bull cycles. Bitcoin Muted Retail Activity and Future Market Signals While institutional activity appears to be solidifying, retail investor behavior remains subdued. Avocado noted that, unlike previous cycles where retail-driven volume increases contributed to UTXO growth, the current rally lacks that widespread grassroots engagement. The number of newly created UTXOs has remained relatively flat, reinforcing the view that retail participation is yet to catch up. Looking ahead, the analyst suggests that any renewed wave of short-term speculation, often sparked by sharp price movements, could reignite retail interest. This would be reflected in increased UTXO creation, exchange activity, and possibly greater volatility. Until then, the market appears to be led primarily by long-term strategic accumulation. Related Reading: The Final Bitcoin Act: Here’s What To Expect As BTC Trends Sideways Despite the current slowdown in price, underlying metrics remain constructive.

2025-07-22 02:40:19+00:00,Bitcoin ETFs Face Startling $131 Million Outflow Reversal,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs Face Startling $131 Million Outflow Reversal The cryptocurrency market, renowned for its dynamic shifts, recently saw a significant development concerning U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . After an impressive 13-day streak of consistent inflows, these investment vehicles recorded a notable $131.35 million in net outflows on July 21. This abrupt reversal has naturally piqued the interest of investors and analysts, prompting questions about the underlying reasons and potential implications for the broader digital asset landscape. Let’s dive deeper into what transpired and what this surprising turn of events could mean for the future of Bitcoin ETFs . What Just Happened with Bitcoin ETFs? A Closer Look at the Outflows On July 21, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced a considerable shift from its recent positive momentum. Data shared by crypto market observer Trader T on X indicated a net outflow of $131.35 million, marking the end of a robust 13-day period during which these ETFs consistently attracted fresh capital. This signals a pause in the growing institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. The outflows were not evenly distributed. Several prominent funds bore the brunt of this reversal. ARK Invest’s ARKB led with a substantial $77.46 million departure. Grayscale’s GBTC followed with $36.75 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC also experienced outflows totaling $12.75 million, while VanEck’s HODL and Bitwise’s BITB registered smaller, yet notable, outflows of $2.48 million and $1.91 million respectively. The remaining ETFs reported no change, indicating concentrated activity among a few key players. Here’s a breakdown of the net outflows by specific U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 21: ETF Ticker Issuing Firm Net Outflow (USD) ARKB ARK Invest $77.46 million GBTC Grayscale $36.75 million FBTC Fidelity $12.75 million HODL VanEck $2.48 million BITB Bitwise $1.91 million Other Bitcoin ETFs Various $0.00 million This data highlights a critical moment for Bitcoin ETFs , signifying a break in the positive sentiment that characterized their performance over recent weeks. Understanding the potential reasons behind this shift is crucial for monitoring the digital asset investment space. Why Did Bitcoin ETFs See Outflows? Unpacking the Drivers Behind the Shift The sudden halt in inflows and subsequent outflows for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs can be attributed to several factors, reflecting the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While a single definitive cause is often elusive, potential drivers include: Profit-Taking and Rebalancing: After a strong period of inflows and potentially rising Bitcoin prices, some investors may have opted to take profits. Institutional investors frequently rebalance portfolios to manage risk. Broader Market Sentiment: The crypto market is influenced by macroeconomic indicators. Economic slowdown, interest rate shifts, or inflation concerns could prompt investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets, including digital currencies and their investment products. Bitcoin Price Action: The underlying asset’s performance directly influences ETF flows. A dip in Bitcoin’s price could trigger redemptions as investors react to perceived weakness. Anticipation of Future Events: Investors might be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated market events, such as upcoming economic data releases or central bank meetings. Such anticipatory moves can lead to temporary capital shifts. It’s important to remember that a single day’s data, while significant, does not necessarily define a long-term trend. However, it does provide a snapshot of investor behavior and market dynamics. The Broader Context: A Look at Bitcoin ETFs’ Journey So Far The introduction of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs marked a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Approved by the SEC earlier this year after years of anticipation, these funds were hailed as a significant step towards mainstream adoption and institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. They offer a regulated, accessible way for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without direct ownership. Since their launch, these Bitcoin ETFs have largely seen impressive performance, attracting billions in inflows and contributing to renewed optimism. Their success has been viewed as a validation of Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy. The 13-day inflow streak preceding July 21’s outflows was a testament to this sustained interest, with many analysts pointing to ETFs as a key driver of recent market momentum.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs Face Startling $131 Million Outflow Reversal The cryptocurrency market, renowned for its dynamic shifts, recently saw a significant development concerning U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . After an impressive 13-day streak of consistent inflows, these investment vehicles recorded a notable $131.35 million in net outflows on July 21. This abrupt reversal has naturally piqued the interest of investors and analysts, prompting questions about the underlying reasons and potential implications for the broader digital asset landscape. Let’s dive deeper into what transpired and what this surprising turn of events could mean for the future of Bitcoin ETFs . What Just Happened with Bitcoin ETFs? A Closer Look at the Outflows On July 21, the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market experienced a considerable shift from its recent positive momentum. Data shared by crypto market observer Trader T on X indicated a net outflow of $131.35 million, marking the end of a robust 13-day period during which these ETFs consistently attracted fresh capital. This signals a pause in the growing institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels. The outflows were not evenly distributed. Several prominent funds bore the brunt of this reversal. ARK Invest’s ARKB led with a substantial $77.46 million departure. Grayscale’s GBTC followed with $36.75 million in outflows. Fidelity’s FBTC also experienced outflows totaling $12.75 million, while VanEck’s HODL and Bitwise’s BITB registered smaller, yet notable, outflows of $2.48 million and $1.91 million respectively. The remaining ETFs reported no change, indicating concentrated activity among a few key players. Here’s a breakdown of the net outflows by specific U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs on July 21: ETF Ticker Issuing Firm Net Outflow (USD) ARKB ARK Invest $77.46 million GBTC Grayscale $36.75 million FBTC Fidelity $12.75 million HODL VanEck $2.48 million BITB Bitwise $1.91 million Other Bitcoin ETFs Various $0.00 million This data highlights a critical moment for Bitcoin ETFs , signifying a break in the positive sentiment that characterized their performance over recent weeks. Understanding the potential reasons behind this shift is crucial for monitoring the digital asset investment space. Why Did Bitcoin ETFs See Outflows? Unpacking the Drivers Behind the Shift The sudden halt in inflows and subsequent outflows for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs can be attributed to several factors, reflecting the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While a single definitive cause is often elusive, potential drivers include: Profit-Taking and Rebalancing: After a strong period of inflows and potentially rising Bitcoin prices, some investors may have opted to take profits. Institutional investors frequently rebalance portfolios to manage risk. Broader Market Sentiment: The crypto market is influenced by macroeconomic indicators. Economic slowdown, interest rate shifts, or inflation concerns could prompt investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets, including digital currencies and their investment products. Bitcoin Price Action: The underlying asset’s performance directly influences ETF flows. A dip in Bitcoin’s price could trigger redemptions as investors react to perceived weakness. Anticipation of Future Events: Investors might be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated market events, such as upcoming economic data releases or central bank meetings. Such anticipatory moves can lead to temporary capital shifts. It’s important to remember that a single day’s data, while significant, does not necessarily define a long-term trend. However, it does provide a snapshot of investor behavior and market dynamics.

The Solana price has once again captured the spotlight, achieving a significant milestone that has investors and enthusiasts talking. For the first time since February 15, Solana (SOL) has majestically reclaimed the coveted $200 level, marking a powerful resurgence in its market performance. According to diligent market monitoring by Bitcoin World, Solana’s impressive climb saw it not just touch but firmly establish itself above this key psychological and technical resistance point. As per CoinMarketCap data, SOL was recently trading at $203.76, reflecting an impressive surge of 11.97% within a mere 24-hour window. This move isn’t just a fleeting moment; it signifies a robust momentum shift that could have profound implications for the altcoin’s trajectory in the coming weeks. What’s Driving the Solana Price Surge? The recent ascent of the Solana price isn’t merely a stroke of luck; it’s a confluence of several impactful factors contributing to its renewed vigor. Understanding these elements is crucial for anyone looking to grasp the underlying strength of Solana’s ecosystem and its market position. Market Dynamics and Investor Sentiment The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced a wave of renewed optimism, largely fueled by Bitcoin’s sustained strength and the anticipation surrounding various industry developments. When Bitcoin, the market leader, shows stability or growth, it often creates a positive ripple effect across altcoins. Investors, seeing Bitcoin’s resilience, tend to rotate capital into promising altcoins like Solana, seeking higher returns. Bitcoin’s Stability: A strong Bitcoin provides a solid foundation for altcoin rallies. Risk Appetite: Increased investor confidence leads to a greater willingness to invest in higher-risk, higher-reward assets. Positive News Flow: General good news surrounding the crypto space, such as regulatory clarity or institutional adoption, boosts overall sentiment. Solana’s Ecosystem Growth and Development Beyond market sentiment, the fundamental strength of Solana’s blockchain continues to be a major catalyst. The Solana network boasts impressive technical capabilities, which are attracting developers and users alike. Its high throughput and low transaction costs make it an attractive platform for decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. Key developments contributing to the positive sentiment include: Developer Activity: A growing number of developers are choosing Solana for new projects, indicating confidence in its long-term viability. NFT Marketplace Dominance: Solana has cemented its position as a leading blockchain for NFTs, with popular marketplaces and collections driving significant volume. DeFi Expansion: New DeFi protocols and existing ones expanding their presence on Solana contribute to increased network utility and demand for SOL tokens. Technological Upgrades: Continuous improvements to the network’s stability and scalability address past concerns and enhance user experience. These factors collectively paint a picture of a robust and expanding ecosystem, providing a strong foundation for the recent increase in Solana price .

If so, you’ve likely noticed the remarkable momentum building around Spot Ethereum ETFs . These investment vehicles are rapidly becoming a focal point for both institutional and retail investors, signaling a significant shift in how mainstream finance engages with the cryptocurrency market. The latest figures reveal a truly exciting trend, pointing towards growing confidence and liquidity in the Ethereum ecosystem. The Astonishing Inflow Surge of Spot Ethereum ETFs The financial world is buzzing with news that U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded an impressive total net inflow of $298.06 million on July 21. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks an incredible streak of 12 consecutive trading days with positive flows. This sustained interest, as highlighted by crypto analyst Trader T on X, underscores a powerful narrative of increasing institutional adoption and investor confidence in Ethereum. Let’s break down which funds are leading this charge, painting a clearer picture of where the capital is flowing: ETF Name Net Inflow (July 21) Fidelity’s FETH $126.93 million BlackRock’s ETHA $102.70 million Grayscale’s Mini ETH $54.90 million Bitwise’s ETHW $13.15 million ARK 21Shares’ CETH $0.37 million It’s clear that major players like Fidelity and BlackRock are at the forefront, capturing the lion’s share of these inflows. Their significant contributions demonstrate a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term potential as a digital asset. The fact that the remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day suggests that while the market is consolidating, the active funds are seeing substantial and consistent capital injection. This consistent positive flow into Spot Ethereum ETFs is a powerful indicator of shifting investor sentiment and strategic positioning by major financial institutions. What’s Fueling the Growing Enthusiasm for Spot Ethereum ETFs ? The sustained influx of capital into Spot Ethereum ETFs isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are contributing to this growing enthusiasm: Regulatory Clarity: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs has provided a much-needed layer of legitimacy and regulatory clarity. This reduces uncertainty for traditional financial institutions and their clients, making it safer and more appealing to allocate capital to Ethereum-backed products. Institutional Demand: Large financial players, pension funds, and wealth managers are increasingly looking for ways to diversify portfolios and gain exposure to the digital asset space. Spot Ethereum ETFs offer a regulated, accessible, and familiar pathway to do so without the complexities of direct cryptocurrency custody. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Beyond being a speculative asset, Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Its ongoing development, including scalability upgrades and its transition to Proof-of-Stake, enhances its appeal as a foundational technology, not just a digital currency. Bitcoin ETF Precedent: The successful launch and subsequent performance of Bitcoin Spot ETFs have set a positive precedent. Investors and institutions have seen how such products can integrate into traditional finance, paving the way for similar confidence in Spot Ethereum ETFs . These combined factors create a compelling environment where traditional finance is increasingly comfortable embracing Ethereum as a viable investment asset, accessible through regulated ETF structures. Are Spot Ethereum ETFs a Game-Changer for Crypto Investment? The introduction and rapid adoption of Spot Ethereum ETFs are indeed transformative for the crypto investment landscape. They bridge the gap between the volatile, often intimidating world of direct crypto trading and the familiar, regulated realm of traditional stock markets. Here’s how they’re changing the game: Benefits: Enhanced Accessibility: Investors can now gain exposure to Ethereum through their existing brokerage accounts, eliminating the need for crypto wallets, exchanges, or understanding complex blockchain mechanics. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry for a vast segment of the investing public. Increased Liquidity: Being traded on major exchanges, these ETFs offer high liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day.

If so, understanding the mechanics behind significant market movements is crucial. One such powerful force is crypto perpetual futures liquidation – a term that often sends shivers down a trader’s spine but is fundamental to how leveraged trading operates. In the last 24 hours, the crypto landscape witnessed substantial liquidation events, impacting major assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars. These dramatic shifts underscore the inherent volatility and high stakes involved in derivatives trading. This article will meticulously break down these recent liquidations, explain what crypto perpetual futures liquidation means for your portfolio, and offer actionable insights into navigating this high-stakes environment with greater confidence and control. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation and Why Does it Matter? To truly grasp the impact of the recent market movements, let’s first demystify crypto perpetual futures liquidation . At its core, liquidation in futures trading occurs when a trader’s position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to their margin balance falling below the required maintenance margin. This typically happens when the market moves sharply against a highly leveraged position. Imagine you open a 10x leveraged long position on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin’s price drops by just 10%, your initial margin could be entirely wiped out, triggering an automatic liquidation to prevent your losses from exceeding your collateral and burdening the exchange’s insurance fund. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not, making them popular for continuous speculative trading. However, this also means positions can remain open indefinitely, significantly increasing the risk of liquidation if not managed properly, especially during periods of high market volatility. Leverage Amplifies Risk: Traders use leverage to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. For instance, with 10x leverage, a $1,000 investment controls a $10,000 position. While this can amplify profits dramatically, it equally magnifies losses, making even minor price fluctuations potentially catastrophic. Margin Call & Forced Closure: When losses eat into the initial margin and the account equity drops below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange issues a margin call. If the trader doesn’t add more funds to meet this requirement, the position is automatically closed (liquidated) to prevent further losses for the trader and the exchange. This process is swift and unforgiving. Impact on Market Volatility: Large-scale liquidations can trigger a cascade effect, where one liquidation leads to another as the forced selling (or buying) puts further pressure on prices. This can exacerbate price movements, creating ""liquidation cascades"" that amplify market volatility and can lead to rapid price discovery. The Past 24 Hours: A Critical Look at Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Data The last 24 hours provided a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the crypto market, with significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation volumes across key assets. This data offers a crucial snapshot of market sentiment and the dominant forces at play. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL) were affected: Asset Total Liquidation Volume Dominant Position Liquidated Percentage of Dominant Position Bitcoin (BTC) $111.61 million Short 59.41% Ethereum (ETH) $137.84 million Long 64.35% Solana (SOL) $36.07 million Short 77.28% This data reveals distinct patterns and underlying market dynamics. For Bitcoin (BTC), the majority of liquidations, nearly 60%, were from ""short"" positions. This indicates that a significant number of traders betting on a price decrease were caught off guard by an upward price movement, leading to a ""short squeeze."" This often happens when BTC experiences a sudden rally, forcing bearish traders to close their positions, which in turn fuels further price increases. Similarly, Solana (SOL) saw an even higher percentage of short liquidations at over 77%, suggesting a strong bullish move or a significant rebound that trapped overly bearish traders. Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) experienced the largest total liquidation volume at $137.84 million, with a dominant 64.35% from ""long"" positions. This pattern suggests that many traders expecting a price increase were hit by a downward price swing, leading to a ""long squeeze."" This could be indicative of profit-taking, a sudden bearish catalyst, or simply a market correction that caught overleveraged bullish traders off guard.

This often happens when BTC experiences a sudden rally, forcing bearish traders to close their positions, which in turn fuels further price increases. Similarly, Solana (SOL) saw an even higher percentage of short liquidations at over 77%, suggesting a strong bullish move or a significant rebound that trapped overly bearish traders. Conversely, Ethereum (ETH) experienced the largest total liquidation volume at $137.84 million, with a dominant 64.35% from ""long"" positions. This pattern suggests that many traders expecting a price increase were hit by a downward price swing, leading to a ""long squeeze."" This could be indicative of profit-taking, a sudden bearish catalyst, or simply a market correction that caught overleveraged bullish traders off guard. These figures collectively underscore the rapid and often unforgiving nature of leveraged trading in the crypto space, highlighting the constant battle be"

2025-07-22 03:15:19+00:00,Toss Bank Stablecoin: South Korea’s Pivotal Move Towards USD Digital Currencies,"BitcoinWorld Toss Bank Stablecoin: South Korea’s Pivotal Move Towards USD Digital Currencies The world of digital finance is constantly evolving, and at its heart lies the fascinating innovation of stablecoins. South Korea, a global leader in technological adoption, is now making significant waves with its neobanks stepping into this arena. Get ready to dive deep into the groundbreaking move by Toss Bank, a prominent player in the Korean fintech scene, as it charts a course for the future of digital currencies with its ambitious Toss Bank stablecoin initiatives. What Exactly is a Stablecoin, and Why Does Toss Bank Stablecoin Matter? In the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency, stablecoins stand apart. Unlike volatile assets such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically by being pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to commodities like gold. This stability makes them crucial for various financial activities, from everyday transactions to acting as a safe haven during market fluctuations. The recent revelation, reported by BIZ.HANKOOK, that Toss Bank, a leading South Korean neobank, has filed 54 trademark applications related to U.S. dollar-based stablecoins is a significant development. This move signals a strategic intent to venture into the global stablecoin market, moving beyond its previous focus on Korean Won (KRW)-pegged digital assets. The potential launch of a Toss Bank stablecoin could redefine digital finance in the region and beyond. From KRW to USD: The Strategic Shift of Toss Bank Stablecoin Ambitions Toss Bank isn’t new to the stablecoin concept. The neobank had previously explored and filed trademarks for stablecoins pegged to the Korean Won. However, their latest filings represent a clear pivot towards the U.S. dollar, which serves as the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant peg for most major stablecoins globally. This shift suggests a broader ambition to participate in international digital transactions and provide a more globally recognized digital asset. The sheer volume and variety of the trademark applications are noteworthy. Toss Bank has combined “USD” with its own identifiers, “TS” or “Toss Bank,” to create a range of potential names. Here are some examples of the proposed Toss Bank stablecoin names: USDTBNK USDTS USDTB TBNKUSD TSBKUSD USDK (potentially combining USD with “K” for Korea) KUSD (Korean USD) This extensive filing indicates a thorough planning process, aiming to secure a wide array of branding options for their future USD-pegged digital currency. The inclusion of “K” in some names might also suggest a desire to emphasize their Korean origin while operating in the USD stablecoin space. What Benefits Could a USD-Pegged Toss Bank Stablecoin Unlock? The introduction of a USD-pegged Toss Bank stablecoin could bring several compelling advantages, not just for Toss Bank users but for the broader financial ecosystem: Enhanced Global Accessibility: A USD stablecoin would offer Korean users and businesses easier access to a globally accepted digital currency, facilitating international trade and remittances without the complexities of traditional foreign exchange. Reduced Transaction Costs: Leveraging blockchain technology, such a stablecoin could significantly lower the costs and speed up the processing time for cross-border payments compared to conventional banking channels. New Financial Products: It could pave the way for innovative financial services within the Toss Bank ecosystem, including lending, borrowing, and yield-generating opportunities based on a stable digital asset. Increased Liquidity: By adding another reputable stablecoin to the market, Toss Bank could contribute to overall market liquidity and provide more options for traders and investors looking for stable on-ramps and off-ramps in the crypto space. Boost for South Korea’s Fintech Leadership: This move solidifies South Korea’s position as a forward-thinking nation in fintech innovation, demonstrating its willingness to embrace and integrate cutting-edge digital financial solutions. Navigating the Path Ahead: Challenges for Toss Bank Stablecoin While the prospects are exciting, Toss Bank will undoubtedly face significant challenges in bringing its USD stablecoin vision to fruition: Regulatory Clarity: South Korea’s regulatory framework for stablecoins is still evolving. Toss Bank will need to navigate complex legal requirements regarding issuance, reserves, consumer protection, and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. Reserve Management: Maintaining a 1:1 peg to the U.S. dollar requires robust and transparent reserve management. Building and auditing these reserves to ensure trust and stability will be paramount. Competition: The USD stablecoin market is already dominated by established players like Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). Toss Bank will need to differentiate its offering and build trust in a highly competitive landscape.

2025-07-22 04:00:41+00:00,Bitcoin Reserves On Exchanges Hit Highest Level Since June 25 – Is BTC In Danger?,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to hover in the high $110,000 range, on-chain data suggests that a short-term price pullback may be imminent. That said, the broader market structure remains firmly bullish. Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit Near-Month High According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, BTC reserves on centralized exchanges have risen to their highest level since June 25. This surge in exchange-held Bitcoin may signal increasing profit-taking activity among investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Soar? Analyst Sees Fresh $2 Billion Liquidity Triggering Next Leg Up A rise in BTC inflows to exchanges typically precedes distribution phases, as more coins become available for potential sale. This shift is often interpreted as a weakening in buy-side pressure, which could lead to a short-term price decline. ShayanMarkets commented: Historically, rising exchange reserves are associated with local market tops, as more BTC becomes available for potential sale. However, this metric alone should not be seen as a definitive trigger for immediate price drops. Broader market liquidity, sentiment, and demand dynamics remain key. The analyst emphasized that while higher reserves may suggest short-term selling pressure, they don’t necessarily indicate a reversal in trend. Any correction should be evaluated in context, unless accompanied by a significant change in macroeconomic or technical indicators. In a separate CryptoQuant post, analyst Darkfost pointed out a sharp uptick in Bitcoin whale activity. Notably, the last two Bitcoin local tops occurred when monthly average inflows from whales exceeded $75 billion. Between July 14 and July 18, average monthly inflows from whale wallets surged from $28 billion to $45 billion – a $17 billion jump. This pattern suggests that some whales may be taking profits following Bitcoin’s recent all-time high of $123,218 on Binance. What Does On-Chain Data Suggest? On-chain data also shows that long-term holders are distributing their BTC, while short-term holders are increasingly accumulating. This kind of rotation is often associated with late-stage rally behavior and potential exhaustion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Set To Soar?

This suggests that there may still be room for further price appreciation before a broader selloff begins. However, not all indicators are reassuring. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross – a metric that compares network value to transaction volume – is trending higher, which may point to growing market froth.

2025-07-22 04:10:18+00:00,Bitcoin Reserve: Grupo Murano Unleashes a Groundbreaking $10 Billion Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserve: Grupo Murano Unleashes a Groundbreaking $10 Billion Strategy In a significant development for both the real estate and cryptocurrency sectors, Mexico-listed firm Grupo Murano has unveiled an ambitious plan to integrate Bitcoin (BTC) as a core strategic asset. The company aims to build a colossal Bitcoin reserve of $10 billion within five years, starting with an initial $1 billion investment. This bold declaration signals a major shift in corporate asset management, potentially paving the way for more traditional industries to embrace digital assets on a large scale. What’s Driving This Monumental Bitcoin Reserve Ambition? Grupo Murano’s decision to integrate Bitcoin into its core assets reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. The rationale behind such a substantial commitment to a Bitcoin reserve is multi-faceted, rooted in economic foresight and financial innovation. Inflationary Hedge: Bitcoin, with its capped supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed as a robust hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power. Digital Gold: Bitcoin has solidified its position as “digital gold,” a scarce, store-of-value asset often uncorrelated with traditional markets, making it attractive for treasury diversification. Long-Term Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown remarkable long-term growth potential. Companies like Grupo Murano position themselves to benefit from this anticipated appreciation as global adoption expands. Strategic Differentiation: Embracing Bitcoin signals innovation and adaptability, potentially attracting new investors and partners. This strategic pivot by a real estate giant underscores a maturing perspective on cryptocurrencies, moving beyond speculation to considering them fundamental components of a robust corporate balance sheet. The initial $1 billion investment is just the beginning of a transformative journey for Grupo Murano. The Strategic Playbook: Building a $10 Billion Bitcoin Reserve The roadmap laid out by Grupo Murano for its $10 billion Bitcoin reserve is ambitious and methodical. While specific acquisition details are proprietary, the general approach involves phased accumulation over half a decade. This long-term vision suggests deep conviction in Bitcoin’s future value and a commitment to weathering short-term market fluctuations. A $10 billion Bitcoin reserve would place Grupo Murano among the largest corporate BTC holders globally. This strategy focuses on establishing a durable financial foundation for the company’s future operations and growth, not quick gains. Such significant allocation typically involves: Gradual Accumulation: Employing dollar-cost averaging (DCA) to mitigate volatility, buying Bitcoin in smaller, regular increments. Secure Custody Solutions: Partnering with reputable custodians, utilizing multi-signature wallets, and implementing robust internal security protocols. Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape to ensure acquisition and holding strategies comply with local and international financial regulations. Grupo Murano’s move serves as a compelling case study for how large enterprises can thoughtfully integrate digital assets, setting a precedent for other traditional businesses contemplating a similar Bitcoin reserve strategy. Benefits and Opportunities of a Corporate Bitcoin Reserve Adopting a significant Bitcoin reserve offers several compelling benefits for corporations looking beyond conventional treasury management. This strategic shift leverages Bitcoin’s unique properties to enhance financial resilience and long-term value. Financial Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet diversifies away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, which may offer diminishing returns or suffer from inflation. Bitcoin provides an uncorrelated asset class, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Hedge Against Inflation: As central banks continue quantitative easing, fiat currency purchasing power often dilutes. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it a scarce asset, inherently resistant to inflationary pressures from money printing. This makes a Bitcoin reserve an attractive shield against currency debasement. Potential for Appreciation: While past performance isn’t indicative of future results, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated remarkable growth. Companies holding Bitcoin long-term position themselves to benefit from its potential price appreciation as mainstream adoption grows and its utility as a global, permissionless money system becomes more apparent. Innovation and Brand Positioning: Embracing Bitcoin projects an image of innovation and forward-thinking leadership.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserve: Grupo Murano Unleashes a Groundbreaking $10 Billion Strategy In a significant development for both the real estate and cryptocurrency sectors, Mexico-listed firm Grupo Murano has unveiled an ambitious plan to integrate Bitcoin (BTC) as a core strategic asset. The company aims to build a colossal Bitcoin reserve of $10 billion within five years, starting with an initial $1 billion investment. This bold declaration signals a major shift in corporate asset management, potentially paving the way for more traditional industries to embrace digital assets on a large scale. What’s Driving This Monumental Bitcoin Reserve Ambition? Grupo Murano’s decision to integrate Bitcoin into its core assets reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations. The rationale behind such a substantial commitment to a Bitcoin reserve is multi-faceted, rooted in economic foresight and financial innovation. Inflationary Hedge: Bitcoin, with its capped supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly viewed as a robust hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power. Digital Gold: Bitcoin has solidified its position as “digital gold,” a scarce, store-of-value asset often uncorrelated with traditional markets, making it attractive for treasury diversification. Long-Term Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin has shown remarkable long-term growth potential. Companies like Grupo Murano position themselves to benefit from this anticipated appreciation as global adoption expands. Strategic Differentiation: Embracing Bitcoin signals innovation and adaptability, potentially attracting new investors and partners. This strategic pivot by a real estate giant underscores a maturing perspective on cryptocurrencies, moving beyond speculation to considering them fundamental components of a robust corporate balance sheet. The initial $1 billion investment is just the beginning of a transformative journey for Grupo Murano. The Strategic Playbook: Building a $10 Billion Bitcoin Reserve The roadmap laid out by Grupo Murano for its $10 billion Bitcoin reserve is ambitious and methodical. While specific acquisition details are proprietary, the general approach involves phased accumulation over half a decade. This long-term vision suggests deep conviction in Bitcoin’s future value and a commitment to weathering short-term market fluctuations.

But well-known gold advocate and crypto critic Peter Schiff believes this is the perfect time for holders to exit. In his latest post on X, Schiff suggested that Ethereum is nearing the top of its trading range and that it might be better to sell it now and use the funds to buy Bitcoin instead. Even though Schiff isn’t a fan of either crypto, he sees Bitcoin as the stronger option for the moment. Ether is back near the upper end of its trading range again. If you own any, this is a great time to sell. As much as it pains me to say, selling Ether and buying Bitcoin with the proceeds is a better trade than holding Ether. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 21, 2025 Ethereum Price Rally Draws Mixed Reactions The rise in Ethereum’s price is partly due to growing demand from institutions and excitement around Ethereum spot ETFs . In recent weeks, several companies, including BitMine and SharpLink, have added substantial amounts of ETH to their reserves, with some also staking it to earn rewards. Meanwhile, ETH received a major boost during the crypto week, and the passage of three major crypto bills created a strong foundation for the ETH rally. It''s not as far as I''m concerned. I''m just looking at the charts. But I think based on the way the tokens are hyped, Ether has more acknowledged competition for the narrative of its use case. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 21, 2025 However, Schiff’s warning has stirred debate among analysts and investors. Many are questioning whether Ethereum’s rally has gone too far too fast. Schiff pointed out that ETH has struggled to outperform Bitcoin lately and that the recent gains may not be sustainable. He said the smarter trade right now could be switching to Bitcoin, especially if Ethereum hits resistance again. Market Pushback on Schiff’s View Schiff’s comment sparked reactions across the crypto space. Some argued that Ethereum’s long-term use cases, such as smart contracts and staking, still give it strong upside potential. SharpLink Gaming even responded directly, saying they plan to stake their ETH rather than sell it. Analyst Benjamin Cowen also suggested that the ETH to BTC price ratio had already bottomed before Schiff made his call, meaning the timing might not be ideal.

Luna accuses Powell of making “false statements” in her sworn testimony. The charges relate to Powell''s testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on June 25, 2025. Luna stated that Powell “hid lavish details” and misrepresented the state of maintenance in his testimony regarding the renovation of the Eccles Building, the Fed''s headquarters. He also alleged that Powell attributed the project''s cost increase from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion to “minor changes,” a claim Congressional documents have denied. According to the criminal complaint, the project includes luxury features such as a VIP dining room, premium marble finishes, modern elevators, water features, and a rooftop garden. Luna argues that Powell misrepresented the existence of these features.

2025-07-22 05:30:00+00:00,"Strategy Buys 6220 More Bitcoin, But July Buys Slow","This latest buy brought its total holdings to 607,770 BTC valued at over $72 billion. Despite a slight slowdown in monthly acquisitions compared to previous months, Strategy is still the largest public holder of Bitcoin. Its Bitcoin yield also rose to 20.8% after this latest purchase. Meanwhile, in stark contrast, the UK government is preparing to sell over £5 billion ($6.7 billion) worth of seized Bitcoin to help close a national budget deficit. The crypto was mostly confiscated from a Chinese Ponzi scheme, and is currently the subject of legal disputes involving victims and Chinese authorities. Critics argue the sale is premature and could actually harm the UK’s long-term crypto strategy. Strategy Invests $739 Million in Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s Strategy continued its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy by confirming the purchase of 6,220 BTC for $739.8 million last week. The acquisition was disclosed in a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing , and was made at an average price of $118,940 per coin. This move came as Bitcoin briefly surged past $122,000 on July 14 before pulling back to around $118,000. The purchase increased Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 607,770 BTC, acquired at an average price of $71,756, with a total investment now standing at approximately $43.6 billion. As a result of the latest acquisition, Strategy’s year-to-date Bitcoin yield increased to 20.8% , up from 20.2% last week. The company’s Bitcoin yield metric was introduced in August of 2024, and it measures the percentage change in the ratio between its BTC holdings and assumed diluted shares outstanding. The current yield stands just 4.2% short of its 25% target. Strategy’s Bitcoin yield once peaked at 74.3% in 2024. Meanwhile, Strategy’s internal financial activities have also drawn some attention from the crypto community. Senior executive vice president Wei-Ming Shao filed to sell another 10,900 shares of Strategy (MSTR) on July 14, generating roughly $4.9 million. This sale happened after a $25.7 million share offload by the same executive just the previous week. Strategy Bitcoin buys (Source: SaylorTracker ) In terms of accumulation pace, Strategy’s July Bitcoin purchases so far total 10,455 BTC, down from 17,075 in June, 26,695 in May, and 25,370 in April. Despite the slower monthly accumulation rate, the firm is still the largest public holder of Bitcoin. UK Plans to Sell Seized Bitcoin While Strategy is showing no signs of slowing down its Bitcoin accumulation mission, the United Kingdom is reportedly preparing to sell more than £5 billion ($6.7 billion) worth of seized Bitcoin to address its budget deficit, according to The Telegraph . The effort is being coordinated by the Home Office and Treasury Chief Rachel Reeves, in collaboration with law enforcement. While UK police typically handle crypto sales, the Treasury’s involvement is likely due to the scale of the holdings and their potential impact on national finances as Bitcoin’s value recently surged. The government is developing a secure system to store the crypto ahead of the proposed liquidation. Among the seized assets is at least 61,000 Bitcoin—which is currently worth around $7.1 billion—originally confiscated from a Chinese Ponzi scheme in 2018. The stash came to light after Jian Wen , a hospitality worker, tried to launder funds from the scheme by purchasing luxury property. She was later convicted of money laundering and sentenced to over six years in prison in May of 2024. However, the sale of the Bitcoin is legally contested , as Chinese authorities and victims of the scheme demand its return. Susie Violet Ward, CEO of Bitcoin Policy UK, criticized the idea of a sale as premature, especially due to the ongoing legal disputes. The Crown Prosecution Service asked the High Court for permission to retain the assets, which would allow the proceeds to be distributed under the Proceeds of Crime Act—potentially compensating victims and funding police agencies involved in the case. Photo of the property that Wen tried to purchase Freddie New , head of policy at Bitcoin Policy UK, pointed out that victims originally lost yuan rather than Bitcoin, which complicates efforts to return the assets. He explained that any sale would be subject to court-ordered compensation, and the remaining proceeds would potentially go to the Treasury and other recovery bodies. Earlier this year, the UK government also issued a £40 million tender for a crypto asset management framework, but it was later canceled due to inadequate bids. Despite legal and diplomatic complexities, the UK government seems very eager to liquidate its holdings. Critics argue the move is shortsighted. Jordan Walker of the Bitcoin Collective urged the government not to sell the Bitcoin, and warned that it could damage the UK’s long-term economic positioning.

2025-07-22 05:30:10+00:00,Bitcoin Holders Are Taking Profits—But Is the Top Still Far Away?,"Bitcoin’s recent price movement reflects a pause in the broader uptrend, with the asset trading at $117,901 following a near 5% weekly decline. While the current downturn may signal a cooling of investor enthusiasm, on-chain indicators suggest the market may still have room to expand before reaching an exhaustion point. Notably, activity among long-term holders and derivatives traders reveals continued interest and potential for price volatility. One of the standout indicators drawing attention is the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) for long-term holders (LTH), which has climbed to a new high for 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin Climbs, But NVT Indicator Sends a Surprising Signal SOPR Suggests Continued Room for Growth Before Cycle Peaks According to CryptoQuant analyst Gaah, this metric tracks the profitability of coins moved by holders who have kept their Bitcoin for more than 155 days. The latest reading shows that LTHs are beginning to sell at a profit, but the indicator has yet to reach historically critical levels associated with market tops. Gaah emphasized that although LTH SOPR has crossed the mid-range and currently sits slightly above 2.5, it remains well below the 4.0 threshold historically linked with macro tops in previous cycles. This implies that long-term investors are realizing gains, but not to an extent that would suggest market euphoria or widespread distribution. In past bull cycles, SOPR readings above 4.0 marked the onset of significant corrections or cycle tops. The gradual increase in profit-taking could indicate that the market is maturing while maintaining upward potential. Gaah notes that investors should interpret this as part of the natural progression of a bullish phase, though risks of correction still remain. The ongoing accumulation and realization patterns from LTHs provide insight into how confidence and caution can simultaneously exist in market behavior. Derivatives Market Remains Active Amid High Open Interest and Bullish Funding Rates In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain highlighted ongoing activity in the Bitcoin derivatives market as another crucial component of the current market landscape. Open interest, which represents the total number of outstanding futures contracts, remains elevated near $42 billion. This level, though slightly down from recent peaks, is still near historical highs and reflects strong trader participation. Arab Chain also highlighted the role of funding rates in shaping market sentiment. Currently, rising funding rates suggest dominance by long positions, indicating a bullish market environment. Related Reading: Hold On For Dear Life: This Bullish Bitcoin Metric Just Touched A 15-Year High When this sentiment is paired with high open interest, it may point to heightened risk of volatility, especially in an environment where leveraged trades are becoming more frequent.

The reversal follows shifting investor sentiment and portfolio rebalancing, while Ethereum spot ETFs logged strong gains, pulling in nearly $297m the same day. The outflow marked a pause in what had been a robust period for Bitcoin funds, which had collectively attracted over $6.6b in net inflows since early July.

However, they cautioned that the plans are subject to change. The move would make JPMorgan one of the largest US banks to endorse crypto into mainstream. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been a vocal skeptic of Bitcoin, calling the asset a “fraud.” However, he recently said that stablecoins are “real,” adding that JPMorgan will be involved both in deposit tokens and stablecoins. One source familiar with the matter told the FT that CEO Dimon, who once said he would fire any trader who traded crypto, has isolated some clients who dealt with crypto. Lending against crypto would let users pledge their BTC and ETH holdings to borrow loans. Major US banks’ pivot to crypto-based services follows a bullish crypto regulatory environment under the Trump administration. JPMorgan Already Allows Clients to Borrow Against Crypto ETFs The NYC-headquartered bank said in June that it will allow selected clients to borrow against crypto ETFs , starting with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. JPMorgan said it has plans to expand access to other funds after the rollout. The change would apply to wealthy clients, marking a shift in how cryptos are factored into credit decisions. However, lending against the actual digital assets would be the next key step. That said, JPMorgan would need to work on resolving the technical aspects of handling crypto seized from customers who failed to repay their loans.

JPMorgan Chase is reportedly exploring lending against clients’ Bitcoin and Ethereum holdings starting next year, sources told the Financial Times . However, they cautioned that the plans are subject to change. The move would make JPMorgan one of the largest US banks to endorse crypto into mainstream. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been a vocal skeptic of Bitcoin, calling the asset a “fraud.” However, he recently said that stablecoins are “real,” adding that JPMorgan will be involved both in deposit tokens and stablecoins. One source familiar with the matter told the FT that CEO Dimon, who once said he would fire any trader who traded crypto, has isolated some clients who dealt with crypto. Lending against crypto would let users pledge their BTC and ETH holdings to borrow loans. Major US banks’ pivot to crypto-based services follows a bullish crypto regulatory environment under the Trump administration. JPMorgan Already Allows Clients to Borrow Against Crypto ETFs The NYC-headquartered bank said in June that it will allow selected clients to borrow against crypto ETFs , starting with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. JPMorgan said it has plans to expand access to other funds after the rollout. The change would apply to wealthy clients, marking a shift in how cryptos are factored into credit decisions. However, lending against the actual digital assets would be the next key step. That said, JPMorgan would need to work on resolving the technical aspects of handling crypto seized from customers who failed to repay their loans.

2025-07-22 05:55:23+00:00,Crypto-Backed Loans: JPMorgan’s Revolutionary Move Unveiled for Digital Assets,"BitcoinWorld Crypto-Backed Loans: JPMorgan’s Revolutionary Move Unveiled for Digital Assets The financial world is abuzz with a groundbreaking development that could reshape how traditional institutions interact with digital assets. Imagine unlocking liquidity from your Bitcoin or Ethereum holdings without having to sell them. This exciting prospect is no longer just a distant dream, as one of the world’s largest and most influential banks, JPMorgan Chase, is reportedly considering offering crypto-backed loans to its clients as early as next year. This potential move signifies a monumental shift in mainstream finance’s embrace of cryptocurrencies, moving beyond mere curiosity to tangible financial products. What Are Crypto-Backed Loans, and Why Are They a Game-Changer? At its core, a crypto-backed loan allows individuals or institutions to borrow fiat currency (like USD) by using their cryptocurrency holdings as collateral. Unlike selling your crypto, which can trigger capital gains taxes and remove you from potential future price appreciation, a crypto loan enables you to access funds while retaining ownership of your digital assets. This mechanism has been a staple in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space for years, but its potential entry into traditional banking through a behemoth like JPMorgan marks a significant maturation of the crypto market. Why is this a game-changer? For years, institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals have grappled with the illiquid nature of their substantial crypto portfolios. While they believe in the long-term value of assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, converting them into spendable cash often comes with tax implications and the loss of exposure to market upside. Crypto-backed loans offer an elegant solution, bridging the gap between digital wealth and real-world financial needs. This move by JPMorgan could legitimize crypto as a viable asset class for lending within regulated financial frameworks, attracting even more institutional capital. JPMorgan’s Bold Step: Paving the Way for Institutional Crypto-Backed Loans? According to a report by the Financial Times, citing sources familiar with the matter, JPMorgan Chase is exploring the feasibility of offering loans collateralized by clients’ crypto holdings. This includes major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. This consideration is particularly noteworthy given JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s historically skeptical stance on Bitcoin, famously calling it “a fraud” in 2017. However, the bank has steadily evolved its position, recognizing the underlying blockchain technology and the growing institutional demand for digital assets. JPMorgan’s potential foray into crypto-backed loans isn’t just about offering a new product; it’s about setting a precedent. As a global financial leader, their involvement could encourage other major banks and financial institutions to follow suit, accelerating the integration of digital assets into mainstream financial services. This institutional validation is crucial for the broader adoption and stability of the crypto market. It signals a move from speculative trading to practical utility, where digital assets can serve as collateral for traditional financial activities, unlocking vast amounts of previously locked-up capital. How Do Crypto-Backed Loans Actually Work? Understanding the mechanics of crypto-backed loans is essential for appreciating their value proposition. While specific terms may vary between providers, the general process involves a few key steps: Collateralization: A borrower pledges their cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) as collateral to secure a loan. This crypto is typically held in a secure, often segregated, account by the lender or a trusted third-party custodian. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio: Lenders typically offer loans based on a percentage of the collateral’s value, known as the LTV ratio. For volatile assets like crypto, LTVs are usually lower than traditional loans (e.g., 30-50%) to account for potential price fluctuations. Interest Rates: Borrowers pay interest on the borrowed fiat currency, similar to traditional loans. Rates can vary based on the lender, loan amount, and LTV. Repayment and Collateral Release: Once the loan is repaid, the pledged cryptocurrency is returned to the borrower. Margin Calls and Liquidation: Due to crypto’s volatility, if the value of the collateral drops significantly and the LTV ratio exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the borrower may receive a “margin call,” requiring them to add more collateral or repay part of the loan. Failure to do so can lead to the liquidation of the collateral to cover the loan. Here’s a simplified comparison: Feature Traditional Loan (e.g., Mortgage) Crypto-Backed Loan Collateral Real Estate, Car, etc. Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.) Asset Ownership Retained (though lien exists) Retained (collateralized) Liquidity Access cash for various needs Access cash without selling crypt",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/jpmorgan-crypto-backed-loans/,MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ETH|TRADING,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Digital Assets|ETHEREUM|institutional crypto|JPMorgan,BTC,"Crypto-Backed Loans: JPMorgan’s Revolutionary Move Unveiled for Digital Assets.

2025-07-22 06:00:21+00:00,SpaceX Bitcoin: Unveiling a Massive $152M Transfer,"BitcoinWorld SpaceX Bitcoin: Unveiling a Massive $152M Transfer In a move that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency world, Elon Musk’s aerospace giant, SpaceX, has reportedly transferred a staggering $152 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t just any transaction; it marks the first significant movement of SpaceX Bitcoin holdings in three years, raising immediate questions and sparking intense speculation among investors and enthusiasts alike. What does this monumental transfer signify for the future of digital assets and the intersection of space exploration with the crypto economy? Unpacking the Massive SpaceX Bitcoin Transfer: What Happened? The news, initially reported by Aggr News and corroborated by Arkham data on X, indicates a substantial shift in SpaceX Bitcoin assets. For three years, these digital holdings remained largely dormant, a silent testament to the company’s long-term conviction in the leading cryptocurrency. The recent transfer of $152 million worth of BTC represents a significant change in this strategy. While the exact nature of the transfer—whether it was a sale, a reallocation, or an internal move—remains unconfirmed, its sheer size demands attention. Consider the context: Scale: $152 million is a considerable sum, even for a company as large as SpaceX. It highlights the significant value placed on Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Timing: The three-year hiatus makes this move particularly noteworthy. It suggests a deliberate decision influenced by current market conditions or internal financial strategies. Transparency (or lack thereof): Unlike publicly traded companies with more stringent disclosure requirements for crypto holdings, the specifics of SpaceX’s crypto activities often emerge from on-chain analytics rather than official announcements. This event underscores the growing importance of on-chain data in understanding institutional movements within the crypto space, offering glimpses into the strategies of major players like SpaceX and their approach to managing their Bitcoin portfolios. Why Did SpaceX Move Its Bitcoin Now? The timing of this SpaceX Bitcoin transfer is crucial. After three years of apparent dormancy, several factors could be at play, influencing such a significant financial decision. Understanding these potential motivations can offer insights into broader institutional attitudes towards digital assets. Possible reasons include: Market Optimization: Bitcoin has seen considerable volatility and growth over the past year. SpaceX might be optimizing its portfolio, potentially taking profits or rebalancing its asset allocation in response to market highs or anticipated shifts. Operational Funding: SpaceX is a capital-intensive business, constantly requiring funds for research, development, and ambitious projects like Starship and Starlink. Liquidating a portion of their Bitcoin holdings could provide a significant cash injection for ongoing operations or new ventures. Diversification: While Bitcoin is a powerful asset, companies often diversify their holdings to mitigate risk. This transfer could be part of a broader strategy to reallocate funds into other assets, traditional or otherwise. Regulatory Considerations: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Companies might adjust their holdings in anticipation of, or in response to, new regulations or accounting standards. Internal Treasury Management: It’s also possible the transfer is an internal reallocation between different wallets or entities within SpaceX, not necessarily a sale to external parties. This is a common practice for large organizations managing diverse asset portfolios. Without official statements, these remain speculative, but each possibility offers a lens through which to view the strategic financial decisions of a major tech and aerospace company engaging with Bitcoin . Elon Musk’s Influence on Bitcoin and the Crypto Market It’s impossible to discuss SpaceX Bitcoin holdings without acknowledging the profound, often whimsical, influence of its CEO, Elon Musk. His past comments and actions have frequently sent shockwaves through the crypto market, demonstrating the power of individual figures in a decentralized ecosystem. Musk’s crypto journey has been characterized by: Initial Enthusiasm: Early on, Musk was a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, with Tesla even announcing a significant BTC purchase and briefly accepting it for vehicle payments in 2021. This ignited a major bull run. Environmental Concerns: Later, Musk expressed concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption, leading Tesla to halt BTC payments and causing a market downturn. This highlighted the sensitivity of the market to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.

Key Takeaways: SpaceX moved over $152 million in Bitcoin after three years of wallet inactivity. The transaction appears to be internal, with no change in net holdings. SpaceX’s total Bitcoin stash now stands at 6,977 BTC, held via Coinbase Prime. On July 22, a wallet linked to SpaceX executed a large Bitcoin transaction, transferring 1,308.45 BTC, valued at approximately $152.85 million, to a new address. The fee paid for the transaction was a mere 0.00024831 BTC (about $29), onchain data shows. SpaceX Wallet Springs to Life with Largest Move in 3 Years The recent large-scale movement came after the SpaceX wallet sent a small transaction of 0.000248 BTC (worth less than $30) to Coinbase Prime. Historical transaction logs reveal that between three and four years ago, SpaceX received multiple Bitcoin inflows from Coinbase wallets, with single deposits ranging from 1,100 to 1,279 BTC. At the time, the dollar value of these holdings exceeded $1.6 billion during the 2021 bull run, but the current value of the company’s BTC holdings stands at roughly $818.3 million. Arkham’s portfolio tracking indicates that SpaceX’s total Bitcoin holdings are now 6,977 BTC, stored under Coinbase Prime custody. The receiving address has not yet spent the funds, suggesting that the transfer may have been a wallet reshuffle, possibly for enhanced security or restructuring of cold storage protocols. SpaceX’s Foray into Bitcoin SpaceX first made headlines in 2021, when Elon Musk revealed that the company held Bitcoin , though he stopped short of giving precise figures. Subsequent reporting uncovered that by early 2021, SpaceX had amassed around 25,724 BTC , estimated at the time to be worth roughly $373 million However, the firm reportedly wrote down $373 million in Bitcoin holdings across 2021 and 2022 and may have sold all or most of it, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal . The report shows the firm had recorded these BTC assets on its balance sheet, though it’s unclear if the entire stash was liquidated. Elon Musk had publicly confirmed SpaceX’s Bitcoin investment in 2021 following Tesla’s $1.5 billion BTC purchase, which coincided with Bitcoin reaching then-record highs. Tesla later sold 75% of its Bitcoin in Q2 2022 for $936 million, retaining only $184 million worth.

Tesla later sold 75% of its Bitcoin in Q2 2022 for $936 million, retaining only $184 million worth. Musk, a vocal crypto advocate, has frequently influenced markets with his commentary on Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

2025-07-22 06:10:19+00:00,Bitcoin Reserves: Volcon’s Groundbreaking $500M Strategy Electrifies Corporate Treasury,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserves: Volcon’s Groundbreaking $500M Strategy Electrifies Corporate Treasury In a move that has sent ripples across both the automotive and cryptocurrency sectors, Volcon, a Nasdaq-listed electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, has announced a significant shift in its corporate treasury strategy. The company has successfully secured an astounding $500 million in funding specifically earmarked to bolster its Bitcoin reserves . This bold decision, initially reported by Unfolded on X, marks a pivotal moment, signaling a growing convergence between traditional industries and the evolving world of digital assets. For many, it raises a compelling question: Is this the dawn of a new era where companies embrace digital currencies as core treasury holdings? Understanding Volcon’s Bold Move into Bitcoin Reserves Volcon’s decision to allocate such a substantial sum towards Bitcoin reserves is not just a financial transaction; it’s a strategic declaration. It positions the EV maker at the forefront of a burgeoning trend, where companies explore alternatives to conventional cash holdings. But what exactly does this mean for a publicly traded company, and why Bitcoin? Diversification Strategy: By holding Bitcoin, Volcon aims to diversify its treasury assets beyond traditional fiat currencies and short-term investments, potentially hedging against inflation and currency devaluation. Innovation Alignment: As an EV manufacturer, Volcon is inherently linked to innovation and future technologies. Embracing Bitcoin aligns with this forward-thinking ethos, showcasing a readiness to adapt to new financial paradigms. Potential for Appreciation: Bitcoin’s historical performance, despite its volatility, has shown significant long-term growth potential, which could contribute to the company’s overall financial health. This move highlights a growing confidence among some corporate leaders in Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate store of value and a viable component of a modern treasury strategy. It’s a clear signal that the world’s leading cryptocurrency is increasingly being viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a strategic one. Why Are Companies Considering Bitcoin Reserves ? The concept of holding Bitcoin on a corporate balance sheet gained significant traction during periods of high inflation and low interest rates on traditional assets. Companies like MicroStrategy famously pioneered this approach, advocating for Bitcoin as a superior treasury asset. Volcon’s adoption of this strategy suggests a broader acceptance is on the horizon. Here’s a look at the core reasons: Feature Traditional Treasury (e.g., Cash, Bonds) Bitcoin Reserves Volatility Low to moderate High Inflation Hedge Potential Limited (cash), Moderate (some bonds) High (digital scarcity, decentralized nature) Liquidity High High (depending on exchange volume) Return Potential Low Potentially High Storage/Security Bank accounts, custodians Digital wallets, cold storage solutions As you can see, while traditional assets offer stability, Bitcoin reserves offer a different set of advantages, particularly in terms of potential growth and a hedge against the depreciating value of fiat currencies. The decision often boils down to a company’s risk appetite and its long-term financial outlook. The Intersection of EVs and Digital Assets: A New Frontier? Volcon’s identity as an electric vehicle manufacturer adds another layer of intrigue to its embrace of Bitcoin reserves . Both industries are synonymous with innovation, disruption, and a focus on the future. Could this be the beginning of a trend where tech-forward companies, particularly those in nascent sectors like EVs, increasingly look to digital assets to fuel their growth and secure their financial future? The EV sector is capital-intensive, requiring significant investment in research, development, and manufacturing. Securing $500 million for any purpose is a substantial feat, but earmarking it specifically for Bitcoin signals a strategic belief in the asset’s ability to appreciate and contribute to the company’s long-term financial stability. This move could inspire other companies in the renewable energy and technology spaces to re-evaluate their own treasury management strategies. What Are the Challenges and Risks of Holding Bitcoin Reserves ? While the potential benefits are appealing, holding Bitcoin reserves is not without its challenges and risks. Volatility remains Bitcoin’s most defining characteristic. Its price can fluctuate wildly in short periods, which could impact a company’s reported earnings and balance sheet stability.

2025-07-22 06:20:24+00:00,Decoding Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio: A Powerful Market Indicator,"BitcoinWorld Decoding Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio: A Powerful Market Indicator Are you looking to gain a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency market’s pulse? In the volatile world of Bitcoin, discerning the collective sentiment of traders can be a powerful edge. One of the most telling metrics for this is the Bitcoin long-short ratio , particularly for perpetual futures contracts. This crucial indicator offers a snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves, revealing whether the bulls or bears hold the upper hand at any given moment. Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures and explore what these numbers truly signify for your trading decisions. Understanding the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio: What Does it Mean? Before we analyze the numbers, it’s essential to grasp what the Bitcoin long-short ratio represents. In the simplest terms, it compares the number or volume of ‘long’ positions (bets that the price will go up) against ‘short’ positions (bets that the price will go down) on a specific asset, in this case, Bitcoin perpetual futures. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without needing to own the underlying asset, and unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date. A high Bitcoin long-short ratio , meaning more long positions than short, generally suggests a bullish sentiment in the market. Conversely, a low ratio, indicating more short positions, points towards a bearish outlook. This ratio acts as a sentiment gauge, offering insights into the prevailing mood among derivatives traders, which can often precede significant price movements. Why is the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio a Crucial Metric for Traders? For any serious cryptocurrency trader, understanding the market’s underlying sentiment is paramount. The Bitcoin long-short ratio provides a unique window into this collective mindset. Here’s why it’s so important: Sentiment Indicator: It directly reflects whether traders are predominantly optimistic (long) or pessimistic (short) about Bitcoin’s immediate future. Identifying Potential Reversals: Extreme ratios can sometimes signal an impending reversal. For example, an excessively high long ratio might suggest an overleveraged market ripe for a short squeeze or a correction. Similarly, an overly low short ratio could indicate a potential bounce. Confirmation Tool: When combined with other technical analysis tools, the Bitcoin long-short ratio can confirm or challenge your trading hypotheses. If your analysis suggests a bullish move and the ratio shows increasing long interest, it adds conviction. Understanding Liquidity: High trading volumes on both sides of the ratio indicate a healthy, liquid market, whereas heavily skewed ratios might suggest imbalances. A Closer Look: 24-Hour Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Data Let’s examine the recent 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios across key exchanges. This data provides a current snapshot of trader positioning: Category Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Market 48.62% 51.38% Binance 47.82% 52.18% Bybit 47.68% 52.32% Gate.io 52.10% 47.90% The overall market shows a slight lean towards short positions, with 51.38% of traders betting on a price decline compared to 48.62% betting on an increase. This indicates a marginally bearish sentiment across the aggregated data from major exchanges. What Does This Specific Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Tell Us? Analyzing the provided Bitcoin long-short ratio data reveals a nuanced picture: Overall Bearish Tilt: The aggregate data suggests that more traders are currently positioned for a downside move in Bitcoin. This doesn’t necessarily predict a crash, but it indicates a cautious or even bearish sentiment among a slight majority of perpetual futures traders. Major Exchange Consistency: Binance and Bybit, two of the largest derivatives exchanges, show a consistent bearish bias, with over 52% of positions leaning short. This reinforces the overall market sentiment seen in the total aggregate. These exchanges often represent a significant portion of the global trading volume, making their sentiment particularly influential. Gate.io’s Contrasting View: Interestingly, Gate.io presents a different scenario, with 52.10% long positions versus 47.90% short. This divergence could be attributed to several factors: a different user base with varying risk appetites, regional influences, or even specific arbitrage opportunities that might be more prevalent on that platform. It’s a reminder that market sentiment isn’t monolithic across all platforms. This data snapshot suggests that while there’s a slight collective bearish sentiment, it’s not overwhelmingly skewed. The difference between long and short is relatively narrow, indicating a market that could be consolidating or preparing for a move, with both sides having significant presence.

2025-07-22 06:20:31+00:00,India Proposes Bold New Crypto Framework With COINS Act,"The post India Proposes Bold New Crypto Framework With COINS Act appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News India’s crypto ecosystem just got a major boost. Web3 firm Hashed Emergent and policy group Black Dot have introduced the COINS Act, a first-of-its-kind model law designed to promote clarity, innovation, and user rights. This is a big step toward establishing a progressive and consistent approach to Web3 policy in the country. COINS Act Pushes For Crypto Rights The draft law prioritizes user rights and innovation, while providing regulators with a clear path to follow. Although it is non-binding, the Act offers a clear framework for digital rights like self-custody, protocol access, and financial privacy. It also addressed key issues like high taxes, unclear regulations, and the need for a crypto regulator. Here’s what the COINS Act proposes: Digital Rights at the Core: The Act firmly protects key crypto-native rights like self-custody, privacy, and the freedom to deploy or interact with code as fundamental freedoms. A Crypto-Native Regulator: It suggests a dedicated crypto regulator with limited powers, focused on handling services based in India and not interfering with global decentralized protocols. The COINS Act proposes setting up a dedicated crypto regulator just for India, called CARA. This new body would focus only on crypto services aimed at Indian users, leaving out traditional regulators like RBI or SEBI. It’s designed to avoid overreach and keep things clear and focused. Clear Rules for Control & Custody: Centralized platforms would need full licenses, while non-custodial protocols face a light disclosure regime, and fully decentralized protocols face no compliance. Safe Harbours to Boost Local Projects: The Act offers a time-limited safe zone for initial coin offerings (ICOs) in India, giving local crypto projects room to grow without heavy restrictions. Token launches have a two-year window with simpler rules. It also proposes a two-year pause on FEMA regulations to cut through red tape while more crypto-friendly policies are developed. Additionally, developers are protected from being held responsible for how end users use their protocols. Strategic Crypto Reserve: The Act also proposes a national reserve of Bitcoin and crypto assets to strengthen India’s long-term digital sovereignty. Coins Act To Protect Crypto Rights And Simplify Rules Currently, users face high taxes and unclear KYC/AML rules, but don’t have basic legal rights like self-custody or privacy. The Act takes a new approach by treating these rights as constitutional protections and giving users a strong legal foundation. The framework also tailors these rights based on users’ control and custody of assets. Hashed Emergent shared in its report that the Indian government is set to release a long-awaited discussion paper on crypto regulation, a much-needed move after years of slow progress since the 2020 “ban.” It hopes that when the government’s paper drops, the COINS Act will be a pro-innovation blueprint the industry can get behind.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/india-proposes-bold-new-crypto-framework-with-coins-act/,REGULATION|TOKEN SALE|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,BTC,"India Proposes Bold New Crypto Framework With COINS Act.

2025-07-22 06:25:19+00:00,Digital Pound’s Crucial Pause: Bank of England Rethinks UK CBDC Utility,"BitcoinWorld Digital Pound’s Crucial Pause: Bank of England Rethinks UK CBDC Utility The world of digital finance is constantly evolving, with central banks worldwide exploring their own digital currencies. For enthusiasts tracking the pulse of innovation, the latest news from the Bank of England regarding the digital pound project raises significant questions. Is the future of national digital currencies as straightforward as once thought? Recent reports suggest a moment of profound introspection for the UK’s central bank, as it reportedly considers hitting the pause button on its ambitious plans for a retail digital pound . This isn’t merely a technical delay; it’s a fundamental reassessment of whether such a currency truly serves a compelling purpose for everyday citizens and the broader economy. Why is the Bank of England Hesitating on the Digital Pound ? According to Bloomberg, the Bank of England (BoE) is seriously weighing pausing its development of a retail digital pound . This stems primarily from growing concerns about the practical utility of such a currency for the average person. While initial enthusiasm for a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) often cited potential for faster, cheaper, and more resilient payments, the BoE now scrutinizes if these benefits sufficiently outweigh the significant challenges and potential downsides. The core of the BoE’s hesitation revolves around: Lack of Demonstrated Public Need: Is there strong, organic demand for a new digital cash form when existing methods are widely used and increasingly digital? Risk of Disintermediation: A widely adopted retail CBDC could potentially reduce the role of commercial banks in the financial system, impacting their ability to lend and create credit. Privacy Concerns: Despite BoE’s emphasis on privacy, the digital nature raises questions about surveillance and data control among the public. Search for Unique Use Cases: Beyond replicating existing payment functions, the BoE seeks distinct use cases a digital pound could offer that current private sector systems cannot. This introspection suggests a shift from “build it and they will come” to a pragmatic “what problem are we solving?” The Bank is exploring whether similar benefits could be delivered through improvements to existing private sector payment infrastructure, rather than introducing an entirely new central bank-backed digital currency. What Benefits Could a Digital Pound Offer (and Are They Enough)? Proponents of CBDCs highlight potential advantages. For the digital pound , these were envisioned to include: Potential Benefit Description Financial Inclusion Providing a safe, accessible, low-cost digital payment option for all, including the underserved. Payment System Resilience Offering a public infrastructure as a backup in crises, enhancing stability. Innovation in Payments Creating a platform for new financial products and services, fostering competition. Faster & Cheaper Transactions Streamlining payments, potentially reducing costs and increasing speed, especially for cross-border. Monetary Sovereignty Ensuring UK control over monetary policy and financial stability in a digital world, reducing reliance on private or foreign CBDCs. The current deliberation questions if these theoretical benefits translate into tangible utility warranting the significant investment and risks. Are existing payment systems, with ongoing improvements, sufficient to achieve many goals without a new central bank-issued currency? Navigating the Hurdles: What are the Challenges of a Digital Pound ? Beyond utility, any CBDC, including the digital pound , faces substantial challenges contributing to the Bank of England’s cautious stance: Privacy and Data Security: Public concern about traceability. Robust privacy tech and clear legal frameworks are complex to implement. Impact on Commercial Banks: Shifting deposits could reduce banks’ lending capacity, potentially disrupting the financial system. Mitigation strategies like holding limits are crucial. Cybersecurity Risks: A national digital currency infrastructure would be a prime target for cyberattacks, requiring immense security investment. Public Adoption and Education: Convincing broad populations requires extensive education and trust-building. Without clear advantages, adoption could be slow. Cost and Complexity: Building, maintaining, and upgrading such an infrastructure demands significant financial and human resources. These universal challenges reinforce the Bank of England’s commitment to thorough addressal rather than rushed implementation. Global Perspectives: How Do Others Approach the Digital Pound Debate? The UK’s cautious approach contrasts with some economies while aligning with others. Understanding the global landscape provides context: China (Digital Yuan/DCEP): A frontrunner, extensively piloting its digital yuan for retail use, driven by efficiency, financial inclusion, and monetary sovereignty.

Innovation in Payments Creating a platform for new financial products and services, fostering competition. Faster & Cheaper Transactions Streamlining payments, potentially reducing costs and increasing speed, especially for cross-border. Monetary Sovereignty Ensuring UK control over monetary policy and financial stability in a digital world, reducing reliance on private or foreign CBDCs. The current deliberation questions if these theoretical benefits translate into tangible utility warranting the significant investment and risks. Are existing payment systems, with ongoing improvements, sufficient to achieve many goals without a new central bank-issued currency? Navigating the Hurdles: What are the Challenges of a Digital Pound ? Beyond utility, any CBDC, including the digital pound , faces substantial challenges contributing to the Bank of England’s cautious stance: Privacy and Data Security: Public concern about traceability. Robust privacy tech and clear legal frameworks are complex to implement. Impact on Commercial Banks: Shifting deposits could reduce banks’ lending capacity, potentially disrupting the financial system. Mitigation strategies like holding limits are crucial. Cybersecurity Risks: A national digital currency infrastructure would be a prime target for cyberattacks, requiring immense security investment. Public Adoption and Education: Convincing broad populations requires extensive education and trust-building. Without clear advantages, adoption could be slow. Cost and Complexity: Building, maintaining, and upgrading such an infrastructure demands significant financial and human resources. These universal challenges reinforce the Bank of England’s commitment to thorough addressal rather than rushed implementation. Global Perspectives: How Do Others Approach the Digital Pound Debate? The UK’s cautious approach contrasts with some economies while aligning with others. Understanding the global landscape provides context: China (Digital Yuan/DCEP): A frontrunner, extensively piloting its digital yuan for retail use, driven by efficiency, financial inclusion, and monetary sovereignty.

The effort comes as U.S. rules around crypto are starting to clear up and client demand grows louder. The bank already lets some wealthy customers borrow against crypto exchange‑traded funds; tapping actual coins could be next. The question now, how soon, and under what guardrails? From ‘Fraud’ to Collateral: Dimon’s Changing Tune According to people familiar with internal discussions, JPMorgan is studying how to extend secured loans where BTC or ETH held by the client serves as collateral, possibly launching as early as next year. Plans could still change, but the direction is clear: clients want to unlock liquidity without selling their crypto. Years ago, CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a “fraud” and even said he’d fire any trader who dared to touch crypto. Now, his change in tone has surprised many, he recently admitted that stablecoins are “real” and confirmed that JPMorgan will work with deposit tokens and regulated digital assets. Some insiders say the plan could roll out as soon as next year, but much depends on regulatory green lights. From ETF Collateral to Actual Coins The bank already took a first step. In June, it began letting certain high‑net‑worth clients borrow against crypto ETFs starting with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, and expects to add more funds. Lending against spot Bitcoin and Ether would go further. That means solving big nuts‑and‑bolts questions: How is collateral valued in fast markets? Who controls the keys? What happens if a borrower defaults and the bank must seize and liquidate crypto it never custodied? Wall Street Wants In (Carefully) Momentum picked up after the GENIUS Act , new U.S. stablecoin rules, cleared Congress and were signed into law. With cleaner guardrails, legacy firms like JPMorgan feel safer building real products. Other giants are circling. Morgan Stanley is weighing crypto trading through E*Trade. Institutional surveys show most big investors plan to increase digital‑asset exposure this year, not just in Bitcoin and Ether but also leading altcoins and regulated stablecoins. Still, JPMorgan is keeping its feet on the ground. It predicts the stablecoin market will reach $500 billion by 2028 but dismisses trillion-dollar estimates as wishful thinking.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/banking-giant-jpmorgan-eyes-bitcoin-ethereum%e2%80%91backed-loans/,BTC|FIAT|ETH|MARKET|ALTCOIN,News,BTC,"Banking Giant JPMorgan Eyes Bitcoin & Ethereum‑Backed Loans.
