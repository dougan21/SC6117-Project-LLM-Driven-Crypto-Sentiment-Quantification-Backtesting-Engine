Filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year indicate Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway bought 238,613 new shares of Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) in Q1, worth approximately $204 million. The Omaha-based holding company also bought 112,401 new shares of Heico Corporation (HEI), an aerospace and electronics firm. Those new shares were worth nearly $50 million in Q1. Domino’s stock is up more than 2.5% in the past five days, more than 4% in the past month and more than 13.5% year-to-date. Heico’s stock is up more than 35% in 2025. Berkshire Hathaway added shares in both firms while hawking $3.23 billion worth of stock in the financial giants Citigroup, Bank of America and Capital One in Q1. Buffett’s firm completely exited Citigroup in the first quarter, unloading its remaining 14,639,502 shares worth about $1 billion. Berkshire sold an additional 48.7 million Bank of America shares in Q1, worth about $2.19 billion, and 300,000 shares in Capital One exposure, worth more than $46 million. Buffett’s firm also sold all of its remaining 40,180,168 shares of the Brazilian fintech Nu Holdings, which were worth more than $416 million.

US Looking To Seize $7.1 Million In Crypto The US is planning to auction off $7 million worth of cryptocurrency seized by Homeland Security. The seized crypto is tied to an allegedly fraudulent oil and gas investment scheme. The Seattle US Attorney’s Office announced on Tuesday that it was filing a civil action to seek the forfeiture of part of the $97 million taken by the scheme between June 2022 and July 2024. Acting US Attorney for Seattle, Teal Luthy Miller, stated, “The co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims.” According to the attorney’s office, it is seeking the forfeiture of assets belonging to individuals residing in Russia and Nigeria, who used the funds to buy crypto and send it to exchanges in their home countries. US authorities have indicted at least one individual who allegedly facilitated money laundering for transnational criminal organizations. Geoffrey Auyeung was indicted in 2024 after being charged with receiving funds from fraudulent investment schemes. He was also accused of using the stolen funds to buy BTC, USDT, USDC, and ETH, and sending a majority of the assets to Binance. White House Crypto Report Set For July 30 Launch The White House crypto policy report will be released on July 30. The report could potentially ignite an era of US dominance in crypto or increase its regulatory challenges. Bo Hines, executive director of the President’s Digital Asset Advisory Council, announced that the long-awaited report will be made public on July 30. The document is the result of an extensive, 180-day review by the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. The Working Group on Digital Assets is a cross-agency effort involving the Treasury, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and the Department of Commerce. The report will outline strategies to maintain US leadership in digital finance, including a potential Bitcoin reserve and access to the Fed’s payment system for blockchain firms. JPMorgan Calls Stablecoin Forecast Optimistic JPMorgan has called the $2 trillion projection for the stablecoin market, often cited during the recent push to approve crypto market regulation, a “little bit optimistic.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated during a Senate hearing that the stablecoin market could potentially exceed the $2 trillion projection by 2028 if there is adequate legislative support. JPMorgan strategists said in a client note, “We find it hard to believe that the market could grow substantially larger over the next few years, as the infrastructure/ecosystem that supports stablecoins is far from developed and will take time to build out. While adoption is poised to grow further, it might be at a slower pace than what some might anticipate.” Block Joins S&P 500 Jack Dorsey’s Block joined the S&P 500 index on Wednesday.

2025-07-24 14:45:23+00:00,CryptoPunk Acquisition: GameSquare’s Landmark $5.15M Entry into NFTs,"BitcoinWorld CryptoPunk Acquisition: GameSquare’s Landmark $5.15M Entry into NFTs The digital asset landscape continues to evolve at a breathtaking pace, with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at the forefront of this revolution. Once considered niche collectibles, NFTs are increasingly attracting mainstream attention and significant institutional investment. In a move that underscores this growing trend, Nasdaq-listed GameSquare has made headlines with a landmark CryptoPunk acquisition , signaling a bold new chapter for both the company and the broader Web3 ecosystem. This high-profile transaction isn’t just about owning a piece of digital art; it’s a strategic maneuver that speaks volumes about the future of brand identity, community engagement, and corporate presence in the metaverse. Unpacking the Landmark CryptoPunk Acquisition: The Details GameSquare, a prominent player in the esports, gaming, and entertainment sectors, recently announced its acquisition of CryptoPunk #5577. This particular CryptoPunk, a highly sought-after digital collectible, was purchased from none other than Robert Leshner, the visionary founder of Compound, a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. The reported value of this significant CryptoPunk acquisition stands at an impressive $5.15 million. What makes this deal particularly interesting is the payment structure. Instead of a cash transaction, GameSquare exchanged $5.15 million worth of convertible preferred stock for the NFT. This stock is convertible into approximately 3.4 million common shares of GameSquare at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, according to Chainwire. To understand the nuances of this transaction, let’s break down what convertible preferred stock entails: Convertible Preferred Stock: This is a type of preferred stock that gives the holder the option to convert it into a fixed number of common shares of the issuing company. It combines features of both debt (fixed dividends) and equity (conversion into common shares). Preferred Status: Preferred stock typically has a higher claim on company assets and earnings than common stock, meaning preferred dividends are paid before common dividends, and preferred shareholders are paid before common shareholders in case of liquidation. Conversion Option: Robert Leshner now holds stock that can be converted into GameSquare common shares, potentially allowing him to participate in the company’s future growth as a common shareholder. This mechanism offers flexibility and aligns interests, as the value of the convertible stock is tied to GameSquare’s performance. CryptoPunk #5577 itself is a rare “Alien” punk, one of only nine such types, making it exceptionally valuable within the CryptoPunks collection. Its distinct features and scarcity contribute significantly to its high market valuation, making it a prized asset for any collector or corporation looking to make a statement in the NFT space. This particular CryptoPunk acquisition is a testament to the enduring value and cultural significance of these early digital artifacts. GameSquare’s Strategic Leap: Why a CryptoPunk Acquisition? For many, the question arises: why would a Nasdaq-listed company like GameSquare invest millions in a single NFT? The answer lies in GameSquare’s forward-thinking strategy to integrate Web3 technologies into its core business of esports, gaming, and entertainment. This isn’t merely an art purchase; it’s a calculated move to solidify its presence in the burgeoning digital economy. GameSquare operates at the intersection of traditional media and the digital frontier, owning and operating popular esports organizations like Complexity Gaming and creating content for a vast audience. Their decision to pursue a high-profile CryptoPunk acquisition can be seen through several strategic lenses: Brand Identity and Recognition: Owning a CryptoPunk, especially a rare one like #5577, instantly elevates GameSquare’s profile within the Web3 community. It signals a serious commitment to the space and positions the company as an innovator rather than a bystander. This digital asset can serve as a potent symbol for their brand in virtual environments and marketing campaigns. Community Engagement: NFTs are inherently linked to communities. By acquiring a CryptoPunk, GameSquare taps into the passionate and influential CryptoPunks community, and by extension, the broader NFT and Web3 communities. This opens new avenues for engagement, collaboration, and talent acquisition. Metaverse and Digital Presence: As the metaverse continues to develop, digital identities and assets will play a crucial role. GameSquare, deeply embedded in gaming, understands the importance of virtual presence. A CryptoPunk can serve as a foundational digital identity for the company or its key figures within virtual worlds, enhancing their authenticity and reach.

2025-07-24 14:52:08+00:00,Cramer Warns on $37T U.S. Debt—Bitcoin Hyper Emerges as a Smart Alternative,"CNBC’s Jim Cramer stated his unwavering trust in Bitcoin’s power as a safety net against the US’s growing $37T debt. His statement comes amid growing concern about the global financial system’s stability, which casts an economic shadow on future generations. Cramer expressed this exact concern in a recent interview, where he stated: I mean, people want to trade. People want to own some as a hedge against the $37T debt. They don’t want to own the debt. They want to own Bitcoin for their kids.And you know who else feels that way? Me. — Jim Cramer CNBC Interview Cramer’s gravitation towards Bitcoin isn’t based on his personal feelings, but rather the observation that the entire financial system is slowly shifting towards the crypto sector. How Bitcoin’s Influence Grows Among Surging Institutional Adoption Given the growing pro-crypto context, Cramer’s trust in Bitcoin is very well-placed, with Trump’s GENIUS Act setting the foundation for a bullish future. The GENIUS Act passed the House this month, leading Trump to sign it into law less than a week ago. The act establishes a solid legal framework for stablecoin issuers, bringing stability and trust into the crypto sector. This aligns with developments like Ripple applying for banking status and JPMorgan supposedly planning to instate Bitcoin and Ethereum-backed loans by 2026 . On top of that, the institutional adoption rate for Bitcoin is growing by the day, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy now holding 607,770 $BTC and leading a list of 100 institutions with growing Bitcoin reserves. These developments create a powerful pro-Bitcoin and, thus, pro-crypto context where projects like Bitcoin Hyper are almost guaranteed to flourish. How Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Promises to Transform the Bitcoin Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer 2 solution that aims to tackle Bitcoin’s most pressing issue: the subpar transaction speed. Bitcoin is currently capped at 7 transactions per second (TPS), miles below modern industry standards. Bitcoin Hyper relies on two tools to boost Bitcoin’s effectiveness: the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The Canonical Bridge mints the users’ $BTC onto Hyper’s Layer 2, which they can use within the Hyper ecosystem or withdraw to the native Bitcoin layer when necessary. This contributes to decongesting Bitcoin’s network traffic, resulting in smoother transactions and decreased confirmation times. The Solana Virtual Machine enables the lightning-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps, further increasing Bitcoin’s performance, without sacrificing the network’s security. Bitcoin Hyper has been in presale since May 2025 and has already accumulated over $4.5M, with $HYPER sitting at $0.012375. This rapid growth highlights the investor trust associated with a project that aims to succeed where the Lightning Network failed .

CNBC’s Jim Cramer stated his unwavering trust in Bitcoin’s power as a safety net against the US’s growing $37T debt. His statement comes amid growing concern about the global financial system’s stability, which casts an economic shadow on future generations. Cramer expressed this exact concern in a recent interview, where he stated: I mean, people want to trade. People want to own some as a hedge against the $37T debt. They don’t want to own the debt. They want to own Bitcoin for their kids.And you know who else feels that way? Me. — Jim Cramer CNBC Interview Cramer’s gravitation towards Bitcoin isn’t based on his personal feelings, but rather the observation that the entire financial system is slowly shifting towards the crypto sector. How Bitcoin’s Influence Grows Among Surging Institutional Adoption Given the growing pro-crypto context, Cramer’s trust in Bitcoin is very well-placed, with Trump’s GENIUS Act setting the foundation for a bullish future. The GENIUS Act passed the House this month, leading Trump to sign it into law less than a week ago. The act establishes a solid legal framework for stablecoin issuers, bringing stability and trust into the crypto sector. This aligns with developments like Ripple applying for banking status and JPMorgan supposedly planning to instate Bitcoin and Ethereum-backed loans by 2026 . On top of that, the institutional adoption rate for Bitcoin is growing by the day, with Michael Saylor’s Strategy now holding 607,770 $BTC and leading a list of 100 institutions with growing Bitcoin reserves. These developments create a powerful pro-Bitcoin and, thus, pro-crypto context where projects like Bitcoin Hyper are almost guaranteed to flourish. How Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Promises to Transform the Bitcoin Ecosystem Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the Layer 2 solution that aims to tackle Bitcoin’s most pressing issue: the subpar transaction speed. Bitcoin is currently capped at 7 transactions per second (TPS), miles below modern industry standards. Bitcoin Hyper relies on two tools to boost Bitcoin’s effectiveness: the Canonical Bridge and the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). The Canonical Bridge mints the users’ $BTC onto Hyper’s Layer 2, which they can use within the Hyper ecosystem or withdraw to the native Bitcoin layer when necessary. This contributes to decongesting Bitcoin’s network traffic, resulting in smoother transactions and decreased confirmation times. The Solana Virtual Machine enables the lightning-fast execution of smart contracts and DeFi apps, further increasing Bitcoin’s performance, without sacrificing the network’s security. Bitcoin Hyper has been in presale since May 2025 and has already accumulated over $4.5M, with $HYPER sitting at $0.012375. This rapid growth highlights the investor trust associated with a project that aims to succeed where the Lightning Network failed . For this reason, $HYPER may experience long-term investor support, especially following its successful implementation post-launch. This could translate into a post-listing boom that would force $HYPER to $0.32 or higher. A 5-year successful run could put 2030’s $HYPER around $1.50 or higher, for an ROI of 12,021%, based on today’s price. This would transform your $100 investment today into a $12,121 profit by 2030.

Announcing a staggering increase in its at-the-market (ATM) offering from an initial $2 billion to an impressive $4.5 billion, BitMine is setting its sights on a massive Ethereum acquisition . This strategic pivot, detailed in a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing on July 24, signals a bold new chapter for the company and highlights the evolving dynamics within the digital asset space. For investors, enthusiasts, and market watchers alike, this development raises crucial questions: What does this colossal capital raise mean for BitMine? Why is a prominent Bitcoin miner shifting gears to focus on Ethereum? And what could be the broader implications for the crypto market? Let’s delve deep into BitMine’s ambitious strategy and explore the potential ripple effects of this monumental Ethereum acquisition . Ethereum Acquisition: Unpacking BitMine’s Ambitious Strategy BitMine Immersion Technologies, primarily known for its robust Bitcoin mining operations, is making a clear statement about its long-term vision. The decision to more than double its capital raise specifically for the purpose of acquiring additional Ethereum (ETH) is a testament to the company’s belief in Ethereum’s foundational value and future growth potential. This isn’t just a minor allocation; it’s a significant reorientation of capital that underscores a strategic diversification play. Traditionally, Bitcoin miners have focused almost exclusively on BTC. However, as the crypto market matures and various blockchain ecosystems evolve, companies like BitMine are exploring new avenues for growth and risk mitigation. The shift towards a substantial Ethereum acquisition could be driven by several factors: Diversification: Spreading investment across different leading cryptocurrencies can reduce reliance on a single asset’s performance, potentially stabilizing revenue streams and mitigating market-specific risks. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s robust ecosystem, encompassing DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications, offers a wide array of opportunities for value appreciation beyond simple price speculation. Transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS): With Ethereum’s successful transition to PoS (The Merge), the network’s energy consumption has drastically reduced, making it more appealing from an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) perspective, and potentially opening doors for staking rewards. This substantial capital infusion via the ATM offering will enable BitMine to execute its Ethereum acquisition on a scale that few traditional mining companies have attempted, positioning them as a major holder of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The Mechanics Behind the Capital Raise: What is an ATM Offering? Understanding how BitMine plans to fund this massive Ethereum acquisition is crucial. An At-The-Market (ATM) offering is a flexible and cost-effective method for publicly traded companies to raise capital by selling new shares directly into the open market at prevailing market prices. Unlike traditional underwritten offerings, ATMs allow companies to raise funds incrementally over time, giving them greater control and flexibility. Here’s a breakdown of key aspects of an ATM offering: Flexibility: Companies can choose when and how much stock to sell, allowing them to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Cost-Effectiveness: Lower underwriting fees compared to traditional offerings, reducing the overall cost of capital. Market Price Execution: Shares are sold at current market prices, minimizing dilution impact on existing shareholders over a short period, although cumulative sales can still lead to dilution. Transparency: As a public offering, it requires SEC filings, providing transparency to investors about the company’s intentions and financial activities. BitMine’s decision to increase its ATM offering to $4.5 billion signifies a strong strategic intent to accumulate a substantial amount of ETH. This method allows them to acquire Ethereum gradually, potentially mitigating the impact of large single-buy orders on market prices, while continuously raising capital as needed for their Ethereum acquisition strategy. Why Ethereum? Understanding BitMine’s Strategic Rationale While Bitcoin remains the king of cryptocurrencies, Ethereum has carved out its own unique and indispensable niche. BitMine’s significant investment in ETH suggests a deep understanding of its long-term value proposition beyond just being a digital currency.

2025-07-24 15:00:31+00:00,Crypto Hype Cools—Analyst Predicts When The Next Altcoin Surge Will Start,"Crypto markets awoke on Wednesday to the first meaningful bout of selling in more than a month, and Kev Capital TA did not sound surprised. In a late-night livestream, the analyst told viewers that Bitcoin’s failure to clear the “brick-wall” band between $120,000 and $123,000 had made an altcoin shake-out “the most obvious pullback spot ever,” capping four straight weeks of euphoric gains across Ethereum, Solana, Dogecoin, XRP and the rest of the sector. Crypto Bulls Crushed: Why Altcoins Ran Out Of Gas “Daily RSIs were at ninety on everything, including ETH, while Bitcoin was pinned under one-twenty,” he said. “That is a textbook sell wall. You don’t blast through that after running straight up for a month.” His chart of Total-2—the market-cap index that strips out Bitcoin—showed the gauge banging into the exact horizontal ceiling that had turned back altcoins in May, August and November 2021, again in December 2024, and once more in January this year. Each rebuff, he reminded the audience, had sparked corrections of 30-to-60 percent in the majors and far larger drawdowns in the speculative tail. Kev’s core message was that nothing in the current tape resembles a lasting top for the cycle. The move, he argued, is a pressure-release that clears excess leverage and restores “risk-free long exposure” for disciplined traders who skimmed profits on the way up. The fulcrum remains Bitcoin. Until the largest asset can establish weekly closes above the 1.0886 Fibonacci extension at $119,964, altcoins will “run out of gas.” He located initial Bitcoin support at $116,400, with deeper cushions at the $112–113k band and, in a worst-case flush, the $106.8k shelf. A break below the first of those levels “isn’t necessary” in his view, but he warned new entrants against treating a ten-percent dip in their favorite microcap as a buying opportunity: “If Total-2 drops another thirty percent, your altcoin is going down a lot more than ten.” Why, then, does he remain upbeat? Kev cited a confluence of on-chain and macro tailwinds that, in his back-testing, have never failed to resolve higher. Bitcoin’s weekly Hash Ribbons flashed a buy signal nine weeks ago and has advanced only eight percent since—far below the historical mean of thirty-eight to one-hundred-one percent that materialises two to nine weeks after the trigger. A second, still-pending buy signal is “coming within the next week or two,” stacking probabilistic odds in favour of a leg higher. Related Reading: Crypto Market’s Fate Hangs On The Last Days Of July At the same time, he noted, the Federal Reserve’s quantitative-tightening program is “barely selling anything on the balance sheet,” while Truth Inflation’s real-time gauge pins headline CPI at 2.0–2.1 percent. A spate of tariff de-escalations—including a tentative, across-the-board fifteen-percent cut in EU-US duties announced moments before he went live—suggests that inflation risks are skewing lower rather than higher. “As long as the macro stays quiet—low inflation, steady labour market, dovish policy projections—valuations can march north,” he argued, adding that upcoming earnings from Google, Tesla and the rest of Big Tech will feed directly into crypto multiples because “the guidance is correlated whether you like it or not.” Seasonality is the wild card. August and September are notoriously fickle for risk assets, a period he likened to “the biggest vacation month of the year and then back-to-school.” Yet he stressed that cyclicality alone cannot trump a supportive macro backdrop. Instead, he expects a period of choppy consolidation—anchored by Bitcoin’s tussle with $120k and the golden-pocket bounce in Bitcoin Dominance—before the market’s next sustained advance. “We are like the running back; the offensive line has opened the hole, but we haven’t burst through it yet,” he said. “If macro stays resilient, this is the year it finally happens.” His forward timeline therefore hinges on two visible catalysts: A decisive Bitcoin breakout above $123,000. When that prints on a multi-day close, he believes the four-year Total-2 ceiling will snap, unleashing capital rotation back into ETH and the broader alt market. “Everything leads back to Bitcoin,” he said. “Crack that wall and the catch-up trade reignites.” Related Reading: House Passes Major Bills During ‘Crypto Week,’ But Significant Changes May Take Time Second is the continuation of the benign macro mix through Q3. Should inflation hold near two percent and the Fed confirm an end-to-QT schedule in its September meeting, Kev projects the next Hash-Ribbons signal will “play out as violently bullish as the model has ever shown,” delivering what he calls the “last six-month window” of the cycle. Asked in chat “when this pullback will be over,” the analyst refused to pin a date on it. “I’m not looking at the clock,” he replied. “Time doesn’t matter; the levels do.” Still, his body language betrayed optimism: he plans no further sales, sees no need to add unti",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-hype-cools-next-altcoin-surge/,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|ETH|TRADING,Cryptocurrency Market News|altcoin|altcoin news|altcoins|crypto|crypto news,BTC,"Crypto Hype Cools—Analyst Predicts When The Next Altcoin Surge Will Start.

Each rebuff, he reminded the audience, had sparked corrections of 30-to-60 percent in the majors and far larger drawdowns in the speculative tail. Kev’s core message was that nothing in the current tape resembles a lasting top for the cycle. The move, he argued, is a pressure-release that clears excess leverage and restores “risk-free long exposure” for disciplined traders who skimmed profits on the way up. The fulcrum remains Bitcoin. Until the largest asset can establish weekly closes above the 1.0886 Fibonacci extension at $119,964, altcoins will “run out of gas.” He located initial Bitcoin support at $116,400, with deeper cushions at the $112–113k band and, in a worst-case flush, the $106.8k shelf. A break below the first of those levels “isn’t necessary” in his view, but he warned new entrants against treating a ten-percent dip in their favorite microcap as a buying opportunity: “If Total-2 drops another thirty percent, your altcoin is going down a lot more than ten.” Why, then, does he remain upbeat? Kev cited a confluence of on-chain and macro tailwinds that, in his back-testing, have never failed to resolve higher. Bitcoin’s weekly Hash Ribbons flashed a buy signal nine weeks ago and has advanced only eight percent since—far below the historical mean of thirty-eight to one-hundred-one percent that materialises two to nine weeks after the trigger. A second, still-pending buy signal is “coming within the next week or two,” stacking probabilistic odds in favour of a leg higher. Related Reading: Crypto Market’s Fate Hangs On The Last Days Of July At the same time, he noted, the Federal Reserve’s quantitative-tightening program is “barely selling anything on the balance sheet,” while Truth Inflation’s real-time gauge pins headline CPI at 2.0–2.1 percent. A spate of tariff de-escalations—including a tentative, across-the-board fifteen-percent cut in EU-US duties announced moments before he went live—suggests that inflation risks are skewing lower rather than higher. “As long as the macro stays quiet—low inflation, steady labour market, dovish policy projections—valuations can march north,” he argued, adding that upcoming earnings from Google, Tesla and the rest of Big Tech will feed directly into crypto multiples because “the guidance is correlated whether you like it or not.” Seasonality is the wild card. August and September are notoriously fickle for risk assets, a period he likened to “the biggest vacation month of the year and then back-to-school.” Yet he stressed that cyclicality alone cannot trump a supportive macro backdrop. Instead, he expects a period of choppy consolidation—anchored by Bitcoin’s tussle with $120k and the golden-pocket bounce in Bitcoin Dominance—before the market’s next sustained advance. “We are like the running back; the offensive line has opened the hole, but we haven’t burst through it yet,” he said. “If macro stays resilient, this is the year it finally happens.” His forward timeline therefore hinges on two visible catalysts: A decisive Bitcoin breakout above $123,000. When that prints on a multi-day close, he believes the four-year Total-2 ceiling will snap, unleashing capital rotation back into ETH and the broader alt market. “Everything leads back to Bitcoin,” he said. “Crack that wall and the catch-up trade reignites.” Related Reading: House Passes Major Bills During ‘Crypto Week,’ But Significant Changes May Take Time Second is the continuation of the benign macro mix through Q3. Should inflation hold near two percent and the Fed confirm an end-to-QT schedule in its September meeting, Kev projects the next Hash-Ribbons signal will “play out as violently bullish as the model has ever shown,” delivering what he calls the “last six-month window” of the cycle. Asked in chat “when this pullback will be over,” the analyst refused to pin a date on it. “I’m not looking at the clock,” he replied. “Time doesn’t matter; the levels do.” Still, his body language betrayed optimism: he plans no further sales, sees no need to add unti"
2025-07-24 15:01:13+00:00,Bitzero raises $25M to expand clean crypto mining and data centres,"Bitzero, the clean energy crypto mining company backed by Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary, has raised $25 million to accelerate its growth across North America and Europe. The funds will support the purchase and deployment of 2,900 Bitmain S21 Pro miners over the next four to six months, a move expected to boost annual revenue by $10 million. Unlike most miners, Bitzero owns its entire infrastructure—including land, energy sources, and equipment—positioning it for long-term sustainability. The firm also plans to expand its role as a green infrastructure provider for AI and cloud services beyond Bitcoin mining. New hardware expected to generate $10 million annually Bitzero’s latest funding round will enable the purchase of 2,900 high-efficiency Bitmain S21 Pro miners. According to the company, the machines will be installed within four to six months and are expected to contribute an additional $10 million in annual revenue. The new hardware also aims to lower Bitzero’s breakeven point, improving profit margins in an increasingly competitive mining market. The firm operates in cold-climate regions like Norway, Finland, and North Dakota, where lower temperatures reduce energy needs and costs. These areas also offer access to low-carbon, renewable power, helping Bitzero maintain environmentally conscious operations while enhancing long-term profitability. Bitzero owns its land, energy, and facilities In an industry where many miners rent space from third-party data centres, Bitzero has adopted a fully integrated model. The company owns its physical assets, including the energy infrastructure that powers its mining and computing operations. This level of control enables better management of operational costs and scalability. This infrastructure-focused approach has become a strategic differentiator. By reducing reliance on external providers and minimising exposure to fluctuating energy prices, Bitzero has created a more stable and efficient business model. The current expansion will further consolidate its position in the clean mining and data centre sectors. Data centre buildout aims to serve AI and cloud clients Bitzero’s plans go beyond Bitcoin mining. The company is constructing four large-scale data centres across its locations in Norway, Finland, and North Dakota. These are designed to meet the growing demand for high-performance computing needed in artificial intelligence, cloud storage, and enterprise IT. The upcoming facilities are intended to deliver computing power with minimal environmental impact, aligning with Bitzero’s commitment to sustainable infrastructure. The company positions itself as a “clean infrastructure provider” focused on long-term utility across emerging technology ecosystems. Kevin O’Leary backs Bitcoin over Ethereum Investor Kevin O’Leary, who has invested in Bitzero, continues to favour Bitcoin over other digital assets. Speaking to CoinDesk , he described Bitcoin as the go-to asset for those seeking crypto exposure, stating that many investors choose Bitcoin alone for its proven volatility and value proposition. O’Leary also expressed scepticism about Ethereum’s performance, criticising it for being “slow” and inefficient under heavy transaction loads.

2025-07-24 15:11:12+00:00,XRP Holds Strong Above 50-Day EMA Amid Market Cooldown,"What’s Cooking for XRP? According to Vlad Hyrniv, altcoin sentiment is cooling as Bitcoin dominance climbs, with the Altcoin Season Index dropping to 37, which is below the 75 threshold that signals an alt season. The market analyst believes that this is one of the reasons why XRP has pulled back to the $3.13 zone. Nevertheless, all hope is not lost because the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is still holding strong above the 50-day EMA at $2.64. Furthermore, the relative strength index (RSI) is at around 55, hinting at a pause not a breakdown because momentum remains neutral. Therefore, XRP is showing strength by holding above the crucial 50-day EMA, a technical indicator widely used to gauge mid-term momentum and trend health. Notably, the resilience above the 50-day EMA signals that bullish sentiment remains intact. The market may be witnessing a healthy pullback rather than the start of a broader trend reversal. Historically, corrections of this nature have provided opportunities for re-accumulation, especially when price remains anchored above key moving averages. Technical analysts point to a larger Elliott Wave structure unfolding, with the recent drop likely forming part of a Wave 4 correction. According to crypto strategist Man of Bitcoin, a sustained close above $3.25 could mark the completion of this corrective phase, paving the way for Wave 5 that could push XRP to a new high of $5.50. The fact that price has not breached the 50-day EMA supports this bullish scenario. On-chain data also backs XRP’s underlying strength. XRP Ledger wallets have surged to 7.24 million amid growing interest in its DeFi capabilities and cross-border use cases. Daily active addresses remain elevated, and whale accumulation continues despite the price drop, indicating confidence among large holders. Conclusion While XRP’s 16.61% drop from its ATH may appear bearish on the surface, the broader picture shows an asset undergoing a standard market correction.

2025-07-24 15:12:27+00:00,"Crypto Firms Raise Billions for Treasuries, But Aren’t Really Buying Crypto: Report","A growing number of publicly traded companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build crypto treasuries, but one analyst says many aren’t actually buying digital assets from the open market. Key Takeaways: Crypto treasury firms often receive insider crypto contributions instead of buying from the open market. These models allow early contributors to cash out at a premium once stocks surge. Analyst Ran Neuner warns the trend could mirror past bubbles, with retail investors left holding inflated shares. The crypto treasury trend took off after MicroStrategy’s headline-making Bitcoin purchases in 2020. Since then, companies like SharpLink Gaming, Upexi, and GameStop have announced multi-million or even billion-dollar fundraising efforts to build Ethereum, Solana, or Bitcoin treasuries. Yet, crypto prices remain relatively stable despite this supposed influx of demand. Crypto Treasuries Are Just Exit Vehicles for Insiders Talking to Forbes, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders . Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. For example, SharpLink’s $425 million Ethereum treasury wasn’t funded by institutions. According to Neuner, crypto holders contributed ETH in return for shares at net asset value. Once the company publicly declared itself an Ethereum treasury firm, the stock surged, giving early contributors a chance to cash out with significant upside. “As soon as we announce to the market that this company is an ETH treasury company, the shares that you got at net asset value are going to be worth three times net asset value,” he said. https://twitter.com/gametheorizing/status/1946162921844756985 It’s a pattern that’s repeated across other firms. Upexi raised over $300 million while claiming to have acquired 1.9 million SOL . Bit Origin wants to raise $500 million for Dogecoin. GameStop allegedly converted $1.5 billion in debt into Bitcoin . Neuner said little of that activity appears to come from actual market buying. The underlying model benefits insiders as they get liquidity, regulatory legitimacy, and tax efficiency — all while avoiding the price impact of selling on exchanges. Meanwhile, retail investors often end up paying 2-4x the net asset value for these stocks. Neuner warned that this is like a new form of leverage in crypto. Like past bubbles, he believes this treasury craze may burst just as suddenly. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV).

According to Bitcoin World market monitoring and data from the Binance USDT market, BTC is currently trading at an impressive $119,060.4. This surge has captivated investors and analysts, prompting discussions about its drivers and Bitcoin’s future. Decoding Bitcoin’s Ascent: What Does This Significant Bitcoin Price Signify? When the Bitcoin price breaks through key resistance levels, it often signals a shift in market sentiment and potentially the start of a new rally. The move above $119,000 is more than just a number; it represents renewed confidence and strong buying pressure. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding crypto landscape. Several factors typically contribute to such a significant upward movement in the Bitcoin price . These can include a mix of macroeconomic trends, increasing institutional adoption, technological advancements, and shifts in investor psychology. Let’s delve into some of the key catalysts fueling this latest surge: Institutional Inflow: Growing interest from large financial institutions and corporations, who are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, provides substantial buying power and legitimacy. Halving Narrative: The anticipation and aftermath of Bitcoin’s halving events often lead to supply shocks, which historically have preceded significant price increases due to reduced new supply. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic uncertainties, inflation concerns, and a weakening fiat currency environment can push investors towards Bitcoin as a perceived hedge or ‘digital gold’. Positive Market Sentiment: A general wave of optimism, fueled by positive news, influencer endorsements, or successful project developments within the broader crypto ecosystem, can create a ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) effect. Technical Breakouts: Chart patterns and technical indicators often signal potential upward movements, attracting algorithmic trading and short covering. This confluence of factors creates a powerful upward momentum, pushing the Bitcoin price to new heights and drawing fresh attention from both seasoned traders and new entrants. The Road to $119,000: A Look at Bitcoin’s Historical Journey and Volatility Bitcoin’s journey has been nothing short of a roller coaster, marked by exhilarating highs and stomach-churning lows. From its humble beginnings as a niche digital currency, it has evolved into a global asset class, commanding significant attention from mainstream finance. The current Bitcoin price of over $119,000 stands as a testament to its resilience and long-term growth trajectory, despite its inherent volatility. Historically, Bitcoin has shown a remarkable ability to recover from significant corrections, often reaching new all-time highs. This pattern has cemented its reputation among many as a store of value and a high-growth asset.

Key Takeaways: Bitzero secured $25 million to expand its crypto mining operations with energy-efficient hardware. The company plans to deploy 2,900 miners, generating an estimated $10 million in annual revenue. Bitzero continues to position itself as a leader in sustainable mining. The fresh funding will go toward the purchase of 2,900 Bitmain S21 Pro miners, which are high-performance machines known for their energy efficiency, operating at 15 joules per terahash, the company announced Wednesday . Bitzero said deployment is expected within four to six months and is projected to bring in approximately $10 million in additional annual revenue. Bitzero Keeps Backers Under Wraps as It Scales Sustainable Crypto Mining While the company did not disclose the investors behind the deal, it emphasized that the capital would help drive profitability and scale its operations in line with its sustainability mission. Bitzero has positioned itself as a clean energy player in a sector frequently criticized for its environmental impact. Its data center in Namsskogan, Norway, runs exclusively on hydropower, aligning with the company’s broader strategy to balance profitability with environmental and community interests. “Our mission has always been to prove that Blockchain infrastructure can thrive in harmony with investors, communities, and the environment,” said Mohammed Bakhashwain, Bitzero’s President and CEO. Here’s how the Bitcoin Mining Industry has compared against $BTC This is honestly pretty insane. pic.twitter.com/nH6DZBKYxB — Magnus (@BTCMiningNewz) July 23, 2025 The mining firm’s presence in Europe has already demonstrated the potential of clean energy-driven mining. With the latest funding round, Bitzero is aiming to further cement its role as a leader in sustainable crypto infrastructure — a narrative that’s gaining momentum amid the broader push for greener blockchain operations. Chinese Roots Still Dominate Global Bitcoin Mining As reported, over half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China’s 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas. Major Chinese manufacturers Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, responsible for 99% of Bitcoin mining hardware, have shifted production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, helping boost America’s share of Bitcoin’s total hashrate from 4% in 2019 to 38% today. Hydyrov added that former Chinese miners have often increased capacity after moving abroad, with some expanding by up to 150%, and noted that limited mining still persists within China’s remote regions where enforcement is lax. Meanwhile, earlier this month, a solo Bitcoin miner defied extraordinary odds, successfully mining an entire block and earning just under $350,000 in Bitcoin rewards. The miner, working through the CKpool solo mining pool, used a rig producing 2.3 petahashes per second (PH/s) to solve block 903883.

2025-07-24 15:20:46+00:00,Ghana regulators move forward to cover $3 billion domestic crypto sector,"Ghana is preparing to introduce its first regulatory framework for cryptocurrency as usage of digital assets in the country surges to $3 billion . The Bank of Ghana (BoG) is expected to present a bill to parliament in September to oversee and regulate digital asset exchanges. BoG Governor Johnson Asiama said the main objective is to bring virtual currencies into the mainstream economy. He emphasized that the move would help the country collect reliable economic data, enhance transparency, attract investment, and generate revenue for the national budget. Asiama admitted they are now playing catch-up, noting that many Ghanaians already use cryptocurrencies to send and receive payments . However, most of these transactions remain invisible to regulators, making it difficult to measure the full scope of the country’s economic activity. According to Asiama, integrating crypto into the formal financial system is now critical, as millions of Ghanaians have already adopted it daily. The proposed bill will outline operational standards for digital asset platforms, detail consumer protection mechanisms, and establish tax obligations. It is also expected to strengthen financial oversight amid increasing concerns over money laundering and cross-border fraud. Ghana’s move reflects a broader trend across Africa, where governments are waking up to the reality that cryptocurrency is more than a passing trend. By licensing crypto platforms, Ghana hopes to tap into one of the fastest-growing sectors of its digital economy. Regulators target currency stability Ghana’s move to regulate cryptocurrency could also stabilize the Ghanaian cedi in the longer term, as the local currency has exhibited extreme volatility in recent years. The currency has appreciated by 48% in the last 12 months. But the increase came after it posted a steep drop of 25% in the preceding year, underscoring its volatility. This unpredictability makes monetary policy more challenging, particularly for Ghana, which heavily relies on imports. According to officials, regulating crypto would help the central bank better forecast and steer inflation. Governor Asiama explained that some of the capital flows in and out of the economy through cryptocurrencies were not captured in the country’s official data. He said this limited the central bank’s ability to make accurate economic decisions and impacted the cedi’s value. Now Ghana has a benchmark interest rate of 28%, and inflation fell to 13.7% in June. This wide differential indicates underlying economic dislocations that the BoG aims to alleviate with better data collection and financial inclusion. By regulating cryptocurrency, Ghana can better track money flows, monitor macroeconomic trends, and plan for long-term financial stability. It will also give the central bank greater visibility into how much crypto is being held, traded, or converted into foreign currency by individuals and businesses. Ghanaians and Nigerians lead surge in crypto use Web3 Africa Group’s chief executive officer, Del Titus Bawuah, said about 3 million Ghanaians — or 17% of all adults in the country — use virtual currencies. This includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like USDT. Bawuah said the data showed that Ghanaians used cryptocurrencies for much more than just investment. He noted that people are paying for everyday services, sending money, and running businesses with crypto. He emphasized that it is no longer a niche trend but has become mainstream. According to Bawuah , traded crypto transactions in Ghana totaled $3 billion between July 2023 and June 2024. Nigeria recorded an even higher volume at $59 billion in crypto trades during the same period. Nigeria represents about half of sub-Saharan Africa’s $125 billion crypto volume. Observers say one reason for the boom is a lack of faith in the traditional banking system, and a difficulty getting hold of U.S. dollars. Crypto is a solution, at least for cross-border payments and e-commerce. Crypto could also help to improve regional trade by circumventing currency exchange barriers, said Craig Stoehr, general counsel at pan-African stablecoin payments platform Yellow Card.

This was confirmed when the company’s ETH stash hit 566,776, valued at $3,643.752 per coin. The surge comes just sixteen days after BitMine closed a $250 million private placement on July 8, the first major step in what it calls its asset-light treasury strategy. BitMine’s chairman, Thomas “Tom” Lee, who also co-founded Fundstrat, said the company isn’t slowing down. “At BitMine, we surpassed $2 billion in ETH holdings, just sixteen days after closing on the initial $250 million private placement,” Tom said . “We are well on our way to achieving our goal of acquiring and staking 5% of the overall ETH supply.” That 5% target equals nearly six million ETH, and BitMine says they’re actively working toward it. BitMine plans to hold through diverse Ethereum setups BitMine’s strategy focuses on growing ETH held per share. They plan to do this by using company cash flows, smart capital market moves, and earnings from staking. Volatility, according to them, is an opportunity, not a problem. And they say their strategy also counts on ETH’s price gains to help grow the value of what they already hold. CEO Jonathan Bates doubled down on this focus. “We are committed to Ethereum’s continued growth and look forward to advancing our Ethereum treasury strategy,” Jonathan said. Meanwhile, Ethereum itself is breaking out. After rising past $3,800, analysts say the chart now looks a lot like 2016-2017, just before the coin jumped 5,000% in less than twelve months. In that earlier cycle, ETH struggled for months while Bitcoin took the spotlight, then dropped almost 50%, faked out traders twice, and finally blasted through resistance. That same setup appears to have played out again. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader shared a comparison chart on X (formerly Twitter), showing nearly identical price patterns: a long range, two fakeouts, a sharp dip, and now a breakout. In 2017, ETH moved from under $8 to more than $250 within a year. If the pattern repeats in 2025, ETH could hit $40,000. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-24 15:35:23+00:00,Bitcoin: MicroStrategy Unleashes Monumental $2 Billion Purchase Plan,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: MicroStrategy Unleashes Monumental $2 Billion Purchase Plan In a move that has sent ripples across the financial world, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the pioneering business intelligence firm turned Bitcoin maximalist, has announced a dramatic increase in its planned capital raise. Originally targeting $500 million, the company now aims to secure a staggering $2 billion to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. This monumental decision underscores MicroStrategy’s unwavering commitment to its digital asset strategy and its profound belief in the long-term value of Bitcoin . What’s Driving MicroStrategy’s Bold Bitcoin Ambition? MicroStrategy’s journey into the world of Bitcoin began in August 2020, when it adopted the cryptocurrency as its primary treasury reserve asset. Since then, under the leadership of its co-founder and former CEO, Michael Saylor, the company has consistently acquired more Bitcoin , establishing itself as the largest corporate holder of the digital asset. This latest announcement, significantly upsizing their offering, is a testament to their continued conviction. Strategic Vision: MicroStrategy views Bitcoin as a superior store of value, a hedge against inflation, and a long-term investment that outperforms traditional assets. Market Opportunity: The current market dynamics, including growing institutional interest and the halving event, may present what MicroStrategy perceives as opportune moments for accumulation. Shareholder Value: The company believes that holding Bitcoin directly enhances shareholder value by providing exposure to a rapidly appreciating asset class. This aggressive expansion of their Bitcoin acquisition strategy isn’t just about accumulating more coins; it’s about solidifying MicroStrategy’s unique position as a publicly traded proxy for Bitcoin investment. The initial $500 million target was already ambitious, but doubling down to $2 billion signals an even deeper commitment and a more aggressive stance in the ongoing digital asset revolution. The Mechanics Behind the Massive Bitcoin Offering To finance its substantial Bitcoin acquisitions, MicroStrategy typically utilizes various capital-raising methods, primarily through the issuance of convertible senior notes or equity offerings. These methods allow the company to raise significant capital without immediately diluting existing shareholders (in the case of convertible notes) or by attracting new investors specifically interested in their Bitcoin -centric strategy. While the specific details of this $2 billion offering are still unfolding, it is likely to follow a similar pattern. Convertible senior notes are a popular choice for MicroStrategy because they offer: Lower Interest Rates: Often, these notes come with lower interest rates compared to traditional debt, given the conversion feature. Deferred Dilution: Share dilution only occurs if the notes are converted into equity, usually at a premium to the current stock price. Flexibility: They provide a flexible financing tool that can be tailored to market conditions. This financial engineering allows MicroStrategy to leverage its balance sheet to acquire more Bitcoin , betting on the future appreciation of the digital asset to more than offset the cost of capital. It’s a bold financial maneuver that intertwines corporate finance with the volatile, yet potentially lucrative, world of cryptocurrency. Why Bitcoin? Unpacking MicroStrategy’s Investment Thesis At the heart of MicroStrategy’s strategy is a profound belief in Bitcoin ‘s foundational principles and its future as a global reserve asset. Michael Saylor has consistently articulated a clear investment thesis for Bitcoin , which resonates with many proponents of digital assets: Core Tenet Explanation Digital Gold Bitcoin is seen as a scarce, immutable, and decentralized store of value, akin to digital gold, that is superior to traditional fiat currencies susceptible to inflation. Inflation Hedge With its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is considered a robust hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to quantitative easing and rising inflation. Global Network Bitcoin operates on a decentralized, secure, and globally accessible network, making it a borderless asset for the digital age. Technological Innovation The underlying blockchain technology represents a significant technological leap, offering transparency and security. MicroStrategy’s conviction is rooted in the belief that Bitcoin ‘s network effect, increasing adoption, and programmatic scarcity will lead to substantial long-term value appreciation. They view temporary price fluctuations as opportunities for accumulation, rather than reasons for concern, reinforcing their long-term ‘HODL’ strategy.

As the digital asset recovers to the significant $3,600 mark, many are asking: Is this just the beginning? The current sentiment around the Ethereum price suggests a robust potential for further upside, a view echoed by various analysts. Let’s dive deep into the indicators and expert opinions that paint a promising picture for ETH’s trajectory. Understanding the Ethereum Price Resurgence: What’s Driving It? The journey of Ethereum, from its recent lows to breaching the $3,600 level, has captivated investors and enthusiasts alike. This resurgence isn’t merely a fleeting moment; it’s underpinned by several fundamental shifts and market dynamics. Cointelegraph, a reputable source in the crypto space, highlighted that analysts are pointing to specific on-chain metrics and comparative performance against Bitcoin as key drivers for the continued positive outlook on the Ethereum price . One of the most compelling indicators is the ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio. This metric essentially compares the amount of Ethereum being sent to exchanges versus Bitcoin. A lower ratio for ETH suggests that fewer Ethereum holders are looking to sell their assets compared to Bitcoin holders. This reduced selling pressure is a critical factor, as it indicates stronger conviction among ETH holders and less immediate supply hitting the market, which can naturally support an upward movement in the Ethereum price . Think of it this way: if fewer people are putting their ETH up for sale, while demand remains constant or increases, the price has more room to grow. This relative strength against Bitcoin is particularly noteworthy because Bitcoin often dictates the overall market sentiment. When an altcoin like Ethereum shows independent strength and lower selling pressure relative to BTC, it signals a maturing market where assets are valued on their own merits, not just as a derivative of Bitcoin’s movements. Key Indicators Pointing to Further Ethereum Price Growth Beyond the exchange inflows, another powerful piece of evidence supporting a potential surge in the Ethereum price comes from the ETH/BTC ETF Holding Ratio. This ratio, which tracks the proportion of Ethereum holdings versus Bitcoin holdings in various exchange-traded products (ETPs) or similar investment vehicles, has seen a remarkable increase. Starting from a modest 0.02 in May, it has now climbed to an impressive 0.12. What does this significant jump signify? It indicates a growing institutional and sophisticated investor appetite for Ethereum relative to Bitcoin. As more traditional financial products and large-scale investors allocate a larger percentage of their crypto portfolios to ETH, it injects substantial capital into the Ethereum ecosystem. This increased demand from institutional players can create a strong floor for the Ethereum price and fuel its upward momentum. It reflects a long-term confidence in Ethereum’s technology, its vast ecosystem, and its potential as a foundational layer for the decentralized internet. Let’s visualize the impact of these two key indicators: Indicator Current Trend Implication for Ethereum Price ETH/BTC Exchange Inflows Ratio Lower for ETH vs. BTC Reduced selling pressure, strong holder conviction. ETH/BTC ETF Holding Ratio Increased from 0.02 to 0.12 Growing institutional demand, increased capital inflow. What Challenges Could Impact Ethereum Price Momentum? While the outlook for the Ethereum price appears overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial to acknowledge potential headwinds. No market moves in a straight line, and crypto is particularly known for its volatility. Here are a few factors that could introduce challenges: Broader Market Corrections: A significant downturn in the overall cryptocurrency market, perhaps triggered by macroeconomic factors or regulatory news, could pull down the Ethereum price regardless of its individual strength. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies globally remains a key concern. Unfavorable rulings or new restrictions could impact investor sentiment and liquidity. Network Congestion & Fees: Although Ethereum is constantly evolving (e.g., with scaling solutions like Layer 2s), periods of high network activity can still lead to increased transaction fees and slower processing times, potentially deterring some users. Competition: While Ethereum remains dominant, new Layer 1 blockchains are continually emerging, offering competitive features. Sustained innovation is key for Ethereum to maintain its lead.

2025-07-24 15:44:22+00:00,FOMO Frenzy Hits ETH: Is Another Ethereum Rally Brewing as Traders Panic?,"Ethereum (ETH) has surged by more than 50% in the past month, briefly touching $3,850. The recent FOMO-driven volume spike resulted in a 5.8% ETH-BTC movement. New data hints at a second bullish wave, even as the leading crypto asset has since retraced its steps and is currently hovering above $3,630. FOMO Spike Ethereum’s price ratio against Bitcoin has dropped 5.8% in the past 60 hours. A major FOMO-driven ETH trading volume spike, similar to early May’s pattern, foreshadowed a local top. If trading and social volumes continue declining for the rest of the week, Santiment believes it would strongly signal a second bullish wave. Such a trend could arise as retail investors’ impatience and profit-taking behavior set the stage for renewed upside momentum. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s spot trading volumes have surpassed Bitcoin’s recently for the first time in over a year, amidst renewed investor interest as altseason gains momentum. Last week, ETH’s spot trading hit $25.7 billion, exceeding Bitcoin’s $24.4 billion. Zooming out, altcoin spot volumes reached $67 billion on July 17, the highest since March, which indicated capital rotation across the crypto market. This optimism coincides with a growing appetite among institutional investors seeking direct exposure to ETH through a regulated investment vehicle. Strong Institutional Demand One year since US spot Ether ETFs launched, demand for the asset exposure remains strong. Nine ETFs from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity have collectively pulled in $8.65 billion in net inflows, as per SoSoValue data. An unbroken 14-day inflow streak signals confidence in Ethereum’s long-term role within portfolios. Institutional interest in Ethereum extends beyond ETFs, with numerous public companies now adding ETH to their treasuries as part of a strategic diversification approach. Firms like SharpLink Gaming, BitMine Immersion Technologies, Bit Digital, Coinbase, BTCS, and GameSquare Holdings have publicly disclosed Ethereum holdings. In fact, data shared by CoinGecko revealed that SharpLink holds 360,807 ETH, while BitMine Immersion has accumulated 300,657 ETH.

2025-07-24 15:50:24+00:00,Ethereum ETF: BlackRock’s Phenomenal $10 Billion Milestone,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF: BlackRock’s Phenomenal $10 Billion Milestone In the dynamic world of digital assets, a groundbreaking achievement has sent ripples of excitement across the investment landscape: BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF , known by its ticker ETHA, has not just entered the scene, but has absolutely dominated it. This isn’t just another fund; it’s a testament to the burgeoning mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Imagine a financial product that hits a staggering $10 billion in assets within a year of its launch – that’s precisely what ETHA has accomplished, marking it as the third-fastest ETF in history to reach this monumental figure. For anyone following the evolution of crypto investments, this is a moment that demands attention. The Meteoric Ascent of BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF BlackRock, a titan in the asset management industry, launched its iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) with significant anticipation. What followed, however, surpassed even the most optimistic projections. According to reports, including those from Cointelegraph, ETHA swiftly amassed $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) within its inaugural year. To put this into perspective, this places it among an elite group of ETFs that have achieved such rapid growth, showcasing an unprecedented demand for regulated exposure to Ethereum. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas highlighted an even more astonishing detail: ETHA’s assets didn’t just grow steadily; they exploded. The fund doubled its AUM from $5 billion to an impressive $10 billion in a mere 10 days. This rapid acceleration is a clear indicator of strong investor confidence and a significant inflow of capital into the Ethereum ETF . This isn’t just about the numbers; it’s about the underlying shift in how institutional and retail investors are approaching digital assets. The speed at which ETHA accumulated assets suggests a deep, untapped demand for accessible, regulated crypto investment vehicles. What Exactly is an Ethereum ETF? For those new to the concept, an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, and trades on stock exchanges just like regular stocks. An Ethereum ETF , therefore, is a type of ETF that holds Ethereum as its underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. This indirect ownership comes with several benefits: Accessibility: Investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through traditional brokerage accounts, making it far more accessible than setting up a crypto wallet and navigating exchanges. Security: The fund handles the complexities of storing and securing the underlying Ethereum, alleviating concerns about private keys and digital asset custody. Regulation: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection and oversight that might be perceived as lacking in direct crypto investments. Why is the Ethereum ETF Gaining Such Traction? The explosive growth of BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF isn’t a random occurrence; it’s the culmination of several powerful market forces converging. Understanding these drivers is crucial to appreciating the broader implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Institutional Appetite and Market Clarity A significant portion of ETHA’s rapid accumulation of assets can be attributed to growing institutional interest. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and traditional wealth managers have historically been cautious about direct cryptocurrency investments due to regulatory ambiguities, security concerns, and market volatility. However, the introduction of a regulated Ethereum ETF provides a familiar and secure gateway. BlackRock’s reputation as a trusted financial giant further reinforces this trust, making it an attractive vehicle for institutions seeking diversified exposure to the digital asset space. Furthermore, increasing regulatory clarity surrounding cryptocurrencies, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin and now Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions, has emboldened these institutional players. This clarity reduces perceived risks and provides a framework within which traditional finance can comfortably operate. The institutional embrace of ETHA signifies a maturing crypto market that is gradually integrating into the global financial system. Ethereum’s Robust Ecosystem and Utility Beyond institutional interest, Ethereum itself is a compelling asset. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a store of value, Ethereum is the backbone of a vast and rapidly expanding ecosystem. It powers decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and smart contracts. Its ongoing evolution, including the transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, enhances its appeal by promising greater scalability, security, and energy efficiency.

For those new to the concept, an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is an investment fund that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, and trades on stock exchanges just like regular stocks. An Ethereum ETF , therefore, is a type of ETF that holds Ethereum as its underlying asset. This allows investors to gain exposure to Ethereum’s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. This indirect ownership comes with several benefits: Accessibility: Investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through traditional brokerage accounts, making it far more accessible than setting up a crypto wallet and navigating exchanges. Security: The fund handles the complexities of storing and securing the underlying Ethereum, alleviating concerns about private keys and digital asset custody. Regulation: ETFs are regulated financial products, offering a layer of investor protection and oversight that might be perceived as lacking in direct crypto investments. Why is the Ethereum ETF Gaining Such Traction? The explosive growth of BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF isn’t a random occurrence; it’s the culmination of several powerful market forces converging. Understanding these drivers is crucial to appreciating the broader implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Institutional Appetite and Market Clarity A significant portion of ETHA’s rapid accumulation of assets can be attributed to growing institutional interest. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and traditional wealth managers have historically been cautious about direct cryptocurrency investments due to regulatory ambiguities, security concerns, and market volatility. However, the introduction of a regulated Ethereum ETF provides a familiar and secure gateway. BlackRock’s reputation as a trusted financial giant further reinforces this trust, making it an attractive vehicle for institutions seeking diversified exposure to the digital asset space. Furthermore, increasing regulatory clarity surrounding cryptocurrencies, particularly with the approval of spot Bitcoin and now Ethereum ETFs in various jurisdictions, has emboldened these institutional players. This clarity reduces perceived risks and provides a framework within which traditional finance can comfortably operate. The institutional embrace of ETHA signifies a maturing crypto market that is gradually integrating into the global financial system. Ethereum’s Robust Ecosystem and Utility Beyond institutional interest, Ethereum itself is a compelling asset. Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a store of value, Ethereum is the backbone of a vast and rapidly expanding ecosystem. It powers decentralized applications (dApps), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and smart contracts. Its ongoing evolution, including the transition to a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, enhances its appeal by promising greater scalability, security, and energy efficiency. Investors in the Ethereum ETF are not just bettin"

Based on the similarities, the analyst gave a breakdown of what to expect from ETH in the coming months. Ethereum Shows Descending Broadening Pattern In an X post, Crypto Bullet stated that Ethereum has shown an impressive recovery and is now starting to resemble a Descending Broadening Wedge pattern. He further noted that this pattern is almost identical to the one which ETH had between 2019 and 2020. The analyst added that the picture looks very bullish right now. Between 2019 and 2020, when this pattern emerged, the altcoin rallied from around $180 to $700 in just six months. Related Reading: Ethereum Maxi Compares Bitcoin To Outdated Landlines, Reveals Why ETH Is Better Further commenting on the current Ethereum price action, Crypto Bullet revealed that the altcoin is testing the resistance at around $3,700 for the third time. He believes that ETH will eventually break out from this range. However, the analyst warned that there may be a 10 to 15% pullback around that area before that. Meanwhile, Crypto Bullet assured that Ethereum will rally hard once it breaks out from this formidable resistance. He predicts that this breakout will lead to a new all-time high (ATH) for ETH, meaning the altcoin is likely to reach $4,900 on the next uptrend. The analyst also stated that the cycle top target for ETH is between $8,000 and $10,000. Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is also confident that Ethereum can reach $10,000 before this market cycle ends. In an X post, he stated that the euphoria stage will start when ETH breaks a new all-time high (ATH). He indicated that the break above ATH will spark a rally to between $7,000 and $10,000. Once that happens, the analyst believes that a massive bear market will ensue. ETH Is Yet To Enter The Banana Zone In an X post, crypto analyst Ted stated that Ethereum is yet to enter the banana zone. He noted that right now, the altcoin is going through a correction after pulling a 70% rally from its April 2025 lows. The analyst further opined that there will be some sideways accumulation before ETH breaks above $4,100. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Breakout Above The MA50 Suggests Further Upside, Here’s The Target However, once that happens, he predicts that Ethereum will record the “most violent rally.” His accompanying chart showed that ETH could rally to a new ATH of around $7,000 on the first leg up.

2025-07-24 16:00:46+00:00,"US Government Bitcoin Reserves Still Intact: 198,000 BTC Remain Untouched","Rumors suggesting the US government had secretly sold off a large portion of its Bitcoin reserves were swiftly denied yesterday after new on-chain data emerged. Arkham Intelligence, a US-based blockchain analytics firm and public data platform, published updated figures confirming that the US Government still holds at least 198,000 BTC, currently valued at approximately $23.5 billion. These Bitcoin reserves are distributed across multiple addresses managed by various government agencies, including the US Marshals Service (USMS), FBI, DOJ, DEA, and US Attorney’s Offices. Despite claims of a major selloff, none of these holdings have moved in the last four months, indicating that the government continues to hold its Bitcoin stash intact. The rumors, which circulated widely on social media, were largely triggered by a misinterpretation of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) response from the USMS, which cited holdings of just 28,988 BTC. However, that number represents only a portion of the total reserves, not the entirety. Breakdown Of US Government Bitcoin Holdings According to data from Arkham Intelligence, a significant portion of the US Government’s 198,000 BTC holdings—worth approximately $23.5 billion—originates from two major historical seizures: the Bitfinex hack and the Silk Road investigation. The largest single source is the 2022 seizure from Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather ‘Razzlekhan’ Morgan, who were arrested six years after the 2016 Bitfinex hack. Authorities seized 94,000 BTC from the couple, with additional recoveries bringing the total to 114,599 BTC, now worth $13.65 billion. These funds were originally stolen from Bitfinex customers and, pending legal proceedings, may be returned to victims through restitution. Another major contributor is the seizure of 69,369 BTC (currently $8.26 billion) from ‘Individual X’ in 2020. This person was believed to have exploited a vulnerability to access Silk Road funds years after the darknet marketplace was shut down. The US Government took possession of the BTC after ‘Individual X’ voluntarily forfeited the assets in a landmark case. Arkham also identified other sources of BTC held by US authorities, including smaller seizures from criminal operations and forfeitures resulting from legal settlements. These holdings are spread across wallets linked to agencies such as the US Marshals Service, FBI, and DOJ. This transparency debunks recent rumors about government sell-offs and provides clarity to the public. While the bulk of the seized BTC remains dormant, market participants are closely watching for signs of movement, given the significant potential market impact if liquidated. For now, however, all of these funds remain untouched, offering a buffer of reassurance as Bitcoin hovers near its all-time highs. Price Analysis: Consolidation Persists Between Key Technical Levels Bitcoin continues to trade within a narrow range between $115,724 and $122,077, as shown in the 4-hour chart. This sideways movement follows the strong rally earlier in July that pushed BTC toward new all-time highs. Since then, the price has failed to break above the $122,077 resistance, while buyers have managed to defend the $115,724 support multiple times. The chart also shows that BTC is hovering around the 50-period simple moving average (SMA) at $118,412, slightly above the 100-SMA ($116,614) and the 200-SMA ($111,678), which continue to slope upward—a signal that the macro trend remains bullish. However, declining volume during consolidation reflects indecision in the market. A breakout above $122,077 could trigger renewed momentum toward the next psychological level at $125,000. On the downside, losing the $115,724 support may lead to a deeper retracement, with the 100-SMA and 200-SMA acting as dynamic support zones.

The firm reports that over 95% of this ETH is actively staked or deployed via liquid staking platforms, forming the foundation of SharpLink’s treasury strategy.

The company is also developing a new NFT yield strategy, indicating further capital deployment into Ethereum-based ecosystems. Other companies rounding out the top 10 include Intchains Group (7,023 ETH), KR1, Exodus, and BTC Digital. These firms collectively hold just over 10,000 ETH and have shown relatively stable positions throughout 2025. Ethereum Gains Ground as a Treasury Asset According to the analysis, Ethereum’s growing role in public company treasuries reflects increasing confidence in its utility and store-of-value potential. As of July 2025, only twelve public companies report Ethereum holdings, collectively holding 1,002,666 ETH—worth $3.70 billion. That figure represents just 0.83% of the total ETH supply, but momentum is building. Volatility has impacted valuations, with ETH rebounding from a low near $1,383 in April 2025 to $3,700 by late July. This price recovery has pushed SharpLink’s unrealized gains to 29% and BitMine’s to 13.7%. While gains vary by entry price, all top 10 holders are currently in profit. Still, over two-thirds of all publicly disclosed ETH remains concentrated in just two companies: SharpLink and Bitmine. Despite its limited corporate penetration compared to Bitcoin, Ethereum is gradually making its way into more boardroom strategies—and its influence is expanding.

SharpLink Gaming has emerged as the top public company holding Ethereum, with 360,807 ETH valued at approximately $1.33 billion, according to the latest data from analytics platform CoinGecko. The firm reports that over 95% of this ETH is actively staked or deployed via liquid staking platforms, forming the foundation of SharpLink’s treasury strategy. By turning its ETH holdings into a yield-generating reserve, the company is positioning Ethereum as a long-term cornerstone of its balance sheet. Never stop stacking $ETH pic.twitter.com/BU97GnmNIl — SharpLink (SBET) (@SharpLinkGaming) July 23, 2025 Close behind is BitMine Immersion, a crypto mining company with 300,657 ETH currently worth around $1.11 billion. Chaired by Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee, BitMine plans to eventually control 5% of all Ethereum in circulation, equating to a target of 6 million ETH. This ambition shows the company’s belief in Ethereum’s role as a digital commodity and financial infrastructure backbone, reports CoinGecko. On Wednesday, BitMine Immersion Technologies announced that its common stock is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The new listing is trading under the ticker symbol BMNR. Coinbase and Bit Digital Diversify Exposure Coinbase Global, Inc. ranks third with 137,300 ETH, translating to $507.34 million in value. Once the largest holder of ETH among public firms, Coinbase has been surpassed in scale but remains a major institutional holder. Its ETH exposure represents around 13.7% of all ETH held by publicly listed entities. Bit Digital, known primarily for Bitcoin mining, has also leaned heavily into Ethereum staking. With 120,306 ETH valued at $444.54 million, the company has redirected part of its mining and treasury operations to support Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model, reports CoinGecko. Smaller Players Build Strategic Reserves BTCS Inc. has continued to deepen its Ethereum position, increasing its holdings to 55,788 ETH—worth $206.14 million—following a recent 22,935 ETH acquisition. The company relies on its ETH holdings to power staking and node validation services, enhancing its role in blockchain infrastructure. GameSquare Holdings, a Nasdaq-listed media firm, holds 10,170 ETH and has doubled its digital asset authorization from $100 million to $250 million. The company is also developing a new NFT yield strategy, indicating further capital deployment into Ethereum-based ecosystems.

2025-07-24 16:22:21+00:00,Ether Holds Firm as Analysts See Continued Outperformance Over Bitcoin,"Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), remains in a strong uptrend despite a recent 9% pullback from its seven-month peak. Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows that ETH has bounced back to reclaim the $3,600 level after a brief dip to $3,500 during early Asian trading hours on Thursday. This rebound has sparked optimism among market analysts and on-chain data providers, who believe Ether’s long-term bullish momentum is intact. Lower Selling Pressure Signals Strength One key factor supporting Ether’s continued strength is the ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio. According to CryptoQuant’s latest Weekly Crypto Report, this ratio remains low compared to Bitcoin, indicating that ETH is facing relatively less selling pressure. “Lower ETH/BTC exchange inflow ratio indicates lower selling pressure for ETH,” CryptoQuant noted. “This continues to be a bullish signal for ETH relative to Bitcoin, potentially supporting further upside in the ETH/BTC pair.” The ratio had previously hit a five-year low in May, highlighting the reduced amount of ETH being sent to exchanges compared to BTC. Although it has since edged higher, it remains well below the red zone that typically signals increased selling activity. Investors Increasing Exposure to Ether Another supportive metric is the ETH/BTC ETF Holding Ratio, which has surged from 0.02 in May to 0.12 currently. CryptoQuant interprets this as a sign that investors are increasingly allocating more funds to ETH relative to Bitcoin. This shift in investment patterns indicates “increasing demand for ETH at the margin,” potentially reinforcing Ether’s price resilience and long-term outperformance. Spot Ethereum ETFs Attract Strong Inflows Spot Ethereum ETFs also showed robust performance recently. On Wednesday, the funds posted their seventh-best day for inflows since launching, pulling in $332.2 million in a single day. In stark contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows totaling $285.2 million over a three-day period. In total, Ethereum spot ETFs have accumulated nearly $8.7 million in net inflows and now manage over $16.6 billion in assets. This consistent inflow demonstrates rising investor confidence in ETH and its future potential. Key ETH Price Levels to Watch On-chain analytics firm Glassnode has outlined important Ether price levels based on its cost basis model, which includes realized prices and market means. To the downside, strong support sits in the $2,000–$3,000 range, with specific levels at $2,100 (realized price), $2,500 (true market mean), and $3,000 (active realized price). “This price range would serve as an important level of support in the event that the price corrects back toward it,” Glassnode wrote. To the upside, the primary resistance level is at $4,500, which is one standard deviation above Ether’s active realized price. This level has historically marked significant market resistance during periods of euphoria, including the March 2024 peak and the 2020–2021 cycle. “Breakouts above this threshold tend to coincide with heightened market euphoria and unsustainable market structure,” Glassnode added. “As such, $4,500 can be identified as a critical level to watch on the upside, especially if Ethereum’s uptrend continues and speculative froth builds further.” Outlook Despite the recent dip, ETH appears well-positioned for continued growth, especially relative to Bitcoin. Low selling pressure, rising investor exposure, strong ETF inflows, and favorable technical support levels all point to a resilient outlook for Ethereum. If momentum persists, analysts believe ETH may test the $4,500 resistance zone in the coming weeks.",cryptointelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/ether-holds-firm-as-analysts-see-continued-outperformance-over-bitcoin/,ETH|BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,BTC,"Ether Holds Firm as Analysts See Continued Outperformance Over Bitcoin.

2025-07-24 16:22:22+00:00,ATOM Surges 7% After Sharp Plunge to $4.47 Support Level,"After a heavy bout of selling pressure during the early hours of July 24, ATOM demonstrated impressive resilience, rebounding from an intraday low of $4.47 to close the session at $4.77. The 7% swing within 24 hours—defined by a peak at $4.82 and a low at $4.47—was supported by heavy volume exceeding 2.28 million units, signaling strong interest at the lower boundary. The rapid absorption of sell-side pressure and the subsequent recovery reflect a robust technical foundation, with $4.47 now emerging as a key support level to watch. Zooming into the final hour of trading, ATOM managed a further display of bullish resolve. It opened the hour at $4.69 and mounted a sustained rally, briefly breaching the $4.80 resistance zone on volume exceeding 77,000 units. While that push higher was met with fast distribution near the top, leading to a late-session dip back to $4.74, the token still notched a 1% gain for the hour. The pattern underscores opportunistic profit-taking near resistance but doesn''t negate the constructive tone built from the morning recovery. ATOM’s strong showing comes at a time when broader market sentiment is shifting. After a week that many dubbed “altcoin season” with rampant gains across second-tier tokens, the tide appears to be turning. Several altcoins are now seeing pullbacks, weighed down by shifting risk appetite and the gravitational pull of BTC and ETH volatility. In that context, ATOM’s ability to hold higher ground and attract volume at key levels suggests it may be better positioned than peers to weather this cooling phase in the altcoin cycle. Technical Indicators Highlight Key Levels Overall trading range of $0.33 representing 7% fluctuation between $4.82 maximum and $4.47 minimum. Strong volume support established at $4.47 level with trading exceeding 2.28 million units. Critical resistance threshold identified at $4.80 with elevated volume exceeding 77,000 units. Recovery momentum from $4.47 low to $4.77 close indicating buyer absorption of selling pressure. Late-session profit-taking activity near resistance levels while maintaining bullish trajectory.

2025-07-24 16:53:20+00:00,"Strategy raises equity sale to $2 billion, 4x its original fundraising goal","Strategy, the company run by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor, has boosted its preferred equity sale to $2 billion, four times the initial $500 million, according to Bloomberg. The company is moving ahead with the sale of its Series A Perpetual Stretch preferred shares , which will be priced at $90 each at noon on Thursday in New York. That’s a 10% discount from the face value of $100, and the shares will come with an initial 9% dividend, based on information shared ahead of the pricing. The move is part of Strategy’s broader push to raise cash as it continues buying more Bitcoin. This offering comes at a time when the company’s stock has surged 42.5% year-to-date, and is trading around $412.31 per share as of 10:58 a.m. Thursday, putting the company’s market value at $115 billion. Strategy taps Wall Street banks for expanded offering The offering is being managed by a group of banks, including Morgan Stanley, Barclays, Moelis & Company, and TD Securities. The sale will include 5 million Stretch shares, a number confirmed by Bloomberg. These preferred shares are designed to sit above Strategy’s Strike and Stride series, as well as its common stock , but they’ll rank below its Strife series and previous convertible bonds. What makes this latest offering different from Strategy’s older preferred shares is the dividend structure. The Stretch shares will pay cumulative dividends, and the rate isn’t fixed. The company will have the right to raise the dividend by any amount each month or cut it by no more than 0.25% per year plus any fall in the one-month SOFR rate. This gives Strategy the ability to adjust payouts depending on short-term interest movements. Bitcoin purchases remain the end goal The cash raised from this $2 billion sale is headed straight into Bitcoin. Strategy has confirmed that proceeds will be used to increase its crypto holdings, which currently stand at 607,770 coins, worth about $72.4 billion, based on prices listed on the company’s website. Saylor began buying Bitcoin in late 2020, using a mix of common equity, preferred shares, and debt. That same method is still being used, and dozens of companies have since followed the same approach. But none have gone as far as Strategy, which still holds more Bitcoin than any other public company. Even BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), which controls around $86 billion in Bitcoin, is behind Strategy in direct holdings. Bitcoin’s appeal remains tied to its supply cap of 21 million coins, a hard limit coded into the network. Features like the quadrennial halving events, which cut block rewards for miners every four years, have helped support its scarcity narrative. The final Bitcoin isn’t expected to be mined until 2140. Strategy’s stock price has risen by more than 3,500% since Saylor first pushed the company into Bitcoin. Over the same period, Bitcoin itself climbed about 1,100%, while the S&P 500 only managed a 120% gain. Every part of this capital raise, the expanded share count, the dividend structure, the adjusted pricing, and the use of proceeds, shows that Strategy’s approach hasn’t changed.

Recently, however, a corporate entity linked to Trump and his family quietly slashed its equity stake in the DeFi platform. The Trump-affiliated company DT Marks DEFI LLC previously owned a 60% stake in World Liberty. Fine print on the platform’s website now indicates DT Marks owns approximately 40% of the equity interests in WLF Holdco LLC, which holds the only membership interest in World Liberty Financial. World Liberty notes that WLF Holdco holds all the rights to net protocol revenues from the DeFi platform, except for net proceeds from the sale of WLFI tokens. The platform also notes that neither Trump nor any of his family members “is an officer, director, or employee of WLF Holdco LLC or World Liberty Financial.” World Liberty launched the stablecoin USD1, which is designed to keep a 1:1 peg to the US dollar, in March.

2025-07-24 17:00:49+00:00,BNB Now More Valuable Than Rolls-Royce Holdings As Market Cap Soars,"Many crypto assets are gaining momentum in the market, and Binance Coin ( BNB ) has recently displayed remarkable bullish action as it surges to unprecedented heights. While BNB’s price spiked, its market cap also increased sharply, surpassing the market value of several major assets in the world. Rolls-Royce Overthrown By Binance Token In Market Value BNB, the native token of the Binance ecosystem , is rising sharply as it targets new thresholds. Meanwhile, the market value of the digital asset has witnessed major growth, allowing it to take a step higher in the global asset hierarchy. A recent report reveals that BNB has overthrown iconic engineering giant Rolls-Royce Holdings in terms of market cap, marking a significant milestone for the Binance native token. During the time of the report, the asset’s market cap rose to $106.6 billion, briefly overtaking Rolls-Royce’s $106.5 billion valuation. This milestone demonstrates BNB’s growing recognition in the crypto and financial landscape. The token’s rise above the engineering behemoth highlights the quickening change in the dynamics of global assets, where digital assets are starting to surpass conventional industrial giants. Furthermore, it heralds a wider reinterpretation of value in the digital age as more investors turn to cryptocurrency assets as competitive options in the global financial market. With this growth, the Binance coin has moved to the top 200 global assets, just ahead of Starbucks and Rolls-Royce Holdings. The development has sparked bullish sentiment in the community and market, with some claiming that the leading car company, Mercedes, could be next to be dethroned. As the price increases and usage grows, the token may further establish itself as one of the most valuable assets in the world, targeting other notable assets. A Major Rally To A New All-Time High It is worth noting that the rise above Rolls-Royce holdings comes in light of BNB surging sharply to a new all-time high on Wednesday . The price of the token rose to a new high of $808, which marks a turning point for the cryptocurrency. According to TerraNewsEN on X, the Binance coin is starting to gain prominence, and its recent rise might trigger volatility for most altcoins. The analyst is confident and has predicted that the token could surge to the $1,000 mark, representing its short to medium-term target. Following its rise to a new all-time high, the asset is experiencing huge mentions across social media platforms. Santiment highlighted that strong institutional inflows and bullish market activity on the BNB Chain drove the sharp spike. In the meantime, discussions center on the deflationary tokenomics of BNB, its use in Binance Smart Chain transaction fees, and its function in cryptocurrency trading and investment potential. Along with worries about scams involving transactions, and frequent comparisons with other well-known cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL, and XRP . “The community highlights BNB’s significance in the crypto ecosystem and its impact on market dynamics,” Santiment added.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-valuable-than-rolls-royce/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO,BNB|Binance Coin|BNB Chain|BNB news|BNB Price|BNB price prediction|bnbusd|bnbusdt|btc|ETH|Mercedes|Rolls-Royce Holdings|SOL|TerraNewsEN|XRP,BTC,"BNB Now More Valuable Than Rolls-Royce Holdings As Market Cap Soars.

2025-07-24 17:28:53+00:00,XRP Wins Another Multi-Million Dollar Treasury Program,"A new financial strategy from a company outside the crypto space is quietly reinforcing XRP’s emerging role in institutional finance. On July 23, vertical farming technology firm Nature’s Miracle announced a $20 million XRP treasury program. Cointelegraph revealed this development in a report on X. While unexpected from an agriculture-focused business, the move signals a broader trend as more public companies begin using XRP as a long-term reserve asset. A Bold Signal from Nature’s Miracle The Cointelegraph report described the program as a major milestone. While the company itself is more popular for sustainable agriculture than digital assets, this decision positions it as one of the first publicly traded U.S. firms to adopt XRP as a core treasury holding. The post quickly gained traction due to the $20 million Nature’s Miracle intends to invest in this initiative, and for the signal it sends across industries increasingly open to crypto assets beyond Bitcoin. XRP is now being considered a viable store of value and an operational asset. This treasury program places XRP in the long-term financial planning tools that companies have historically reserved for fiat reserves or commodities. The move also highlights growing confidence in XRP’s regulatory status and its functionality. Other Institutions Embracing XRP Reserves Nature’s Miracle joins a growing list of organizations making significant XRP allocations. Earlier this year, Webus International, a Chinese ride-hailing and payments company, revealed plans to form an XRP reserve valued at approximately $300 million . The company aims to use XRP to reduce settlement friction in its cross-border operations, citing its liquidity advantages as a motivator.

The company now uses the asset for payments, payroll, and as a reserve asset supporting long-term financial planning. Anodos worked with CapSign to move its equity structure fully on-chain using XRP and RLUSD to manage liquidity and reserves within a blockchain-native framework. The decision reflects growing institutional confidence in the digital asset’s settlement speed, cost efficiency, and reliability for core financial functions. From Theory to Utility Nature’s Miracle reserve decision comes amid broader institutional reassessment of cryptocurrencies. Rather than speculative hype, the adoption of XRP in corporate contexts is reinforcing its utility and value.

2025-07-24 17:30:23+00:00,USDT Minted: Unveiling the Epic Impact of 1 Billion New Tokens,"BitcoinWorld USDT Minted: Unveiling the Epic Impact of 1 Billion New Tokens The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the latest report from Whale Alert: a staggering one billion USDT minted at the Tether Treasury. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a significant event that sends ripples across the digital asset landscape. What does such a massive issuance of the world’s largest stablecoin truly signify for market dynamics, investor sentiment, and the future trajectory of crypto? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this monumental move by Tether. Understanding the Power of USDT: What Exactly Was Minted? Before we unravel the implications, let’s briefly recap what we’re talking about. USDT , or Tether, is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. Its primary purpose is to provide stability in the volatile crypto markets, acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currencies and digital assets. When we hear about one billion USDT minted , it means Tether has created a new batch of tokens, typically in response to increasing demand or to bolster their reserves for future redemptions. Tether operates on several prominent blockchains, including Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and Avalanche, ensuring broad accessibility and utility across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The process of minting new USDT usually implies: Increased Demand: A primary driver for minting is a surge in demand from users, exchanges, or institutions who wish to hold USDT. This demand often stems from a need to enter the crypto market, settle trades quickly, or simply hold a stable asset during periods of market uncertainty. The influx of new capital into the crypto space often first passes through stablecoins. Market Making and Liquidity: Tether frequently mints new tokens to provide ample liquidity to various cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms. This ensures that large trades can be executed with minimal price impact (slippage), making the market more efficient. Reserve Management: Tether aims to maintain sufficient reserves (cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and other investments) to back every USDT in circulation. A new mint could indicate an increase in their underlying reserves or preparation for anticipated demand, ensuring the 1:1 peg remains robust. Arbitrage Opportunities: New mints can also facilitate arbitrage opportunities across different exchanges, helping to stabilize prices and ensure the value of USDT remains consistent globally. This latest minting event, as reported by Whale Alert, signals a significant capital movement or strategic positioning by Tether, reflecting broader trends in the crypto landscape. Why Does 1 Billion USDT Minted Matter for the Crypto Market? The issuance of such a substantial amount of USDT minted at once naturally raises questions about its potential impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. Historically, large Tether mints have often preceded periods of increased market activity or even upward price movements for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While correlation does not always imply causation, the market often interprets these mints as a sign of impending capital inflow, often referred to as ‘dry powder’ ready to be deployed. Here’s a breakdown of the key implications and how this large batch of USDT minted could influence market dynamics: Potential Impact Description Increased Market Liquidity More USDT in circulation means more stablecoin available for trading pairs across various exchanges. This enhanced liquidity can ease large transactions, reduce slippage, and make it simpler for institutional and retail traders to enter or exit positions without significantly affecting market prices. It creates a smoother trading environment. Potential for Market Upswing Many analysts and traders view large USDT mints as a precursor to capital flowing into Bitcoin and altcoins. The logic is that this newly minted USDT represents fresh capital that will eventually be used to purchase other cryptocurrencies, thereby increasing demand and potentially driving prices upward. It often fuels speculative buying. Growing Demand for Stablecoins A billion-dollar mint strongly suggests that there is significant, sustained demand for USDT. This reflects growing overall interest in the crypto market, as stablecoins are often the first entry point for new capital, or a strategic move by large players preparing for future market moves. Tether’s Strategic Positioning This could be part of Tether’s broader strategy to expand its reach into new geographical markets, support new decentralized applications (dApps), or prepare for major institutional inflows that require significant stablecoin infrastructure. It reinforces Tether’s dominant position in the stablecoin landscape. Indicator of Market Sentiment For many, a large USDT minted event serves as a bullish signal.

BitcoinWorld USDT Minted: Unveiling the Epic Impact of 1 Billion New Tokens The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with the latest report from Whale Alert: a staggering one billion USDT minted at the Tether Treasury. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a significant event that sends ripples across the digital asset landscape. What does such a massive issuance of the world’s largest stablecoin truly signify for market dynamics, investor sentiment, and the future trajectory of crypto? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this monumental move by Tether. Understanding the Power of USDT: What Exactly Was Minted? Before we unravel the implications, let’s briefly recap what we’re talking about. USDT , or Tether, is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, designed to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar. Its primary purpose is to provide stability in the volatile crypto markets, acting as a bridge between traditional fiat currencies and digital assets. When we hear about one billion USDT minted , it means Tether has created a new batch of tokens, typically in response to increasing demand or to bolster their reserves for future redemptions. Tether operates on several prominent blockchains, including Ethereum, Tron, Solana, and Avalanche, ensuring broad accessibility and utility across the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The process of minting new USDT usually implies: Increased Demand: A primary driver for minting is a surge in demand from users, exchanges, or institutions who wish to hold USDT. This demand often stems from a need to enter the crypto market, settle trades quickly, or simply hold a stable asset during periods of market uncertainty. The influx of new capital into the crypto space often first passes through stablecoins. Market Making and Liquidity: Tether frequently mints new tokens to provide ample liquidity to various cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms. This ensures that large trades can be executed with minimal price impact (slippage), making the market more efficient. Reserve Management: Tether aims to maintain sufficient reserves (cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and other investments) to back every USDT in circulation. A new mint could indicate an increase in their underlying reserves or preparation for anticipated demand, ensuring the 1:1 peg remains robust. Arbitrage Opportunities: New mints can also facilitate arbitrage opportunities across different exchanges, helping to stabilize prices and ensure the value of USDT remains consistent globally.

With Bitcoin targeting $200,000 and Ethereum poised to smash $10,000, retail and institutional investments are already flooding in. But while BTC and ETH are making headlines, savvy investors are zeroing in on one explosive newcomer that could outperform them both in terms of raw ROI: Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — a meme coin that’s quickly becoming the star of Ethereum’s meme revolution. This isn’t another recycled meme coin story. LILPEPE has momentum, tokenomics, viral energy, and community power all aligning at the right moment. As the sixth stage of its presale begins at $0.0015, and over $7.7 million has already been raised, the signs are impossible to ignore. LILPEPE isn’t just rising — it’s preparing to explode. Bitcoin and Ethereum Are Booming — But 100x Gains Lie Elsewhere. Bitcoin’s trajectory to $200,000 by December 2025 is no longer a fringe prediction — it’s becoming the mainstream narrative. With ETFs driving institutional demand and halving-induced scarcity kicking in, BTC is looking stronger than ever as it trades at $118,496. Ethereum, meanwhile, is benefitting from layer-2 adoption, ETF speculation, and ecosystem growth, with $10,000 now seen as a realistic target by top analysts. But here’s the hard truth for retail investors: a $1,000 investment in BTC doubling or tripling might be exciting, but it won’t change your life. On the other hand, a $1,000 investment in a promising early-stage crypto like LILPEPE, priced under a penny, has the potential to deliver life-changing 100x returns — turning a thousand bucks into $100,000 or more if it reaches $0.15 or beyond. And based on current trajectory, that’s not just possible — it’s beginning to feel inevitable. What Makes LILPEPE the Next 100x Contender? LILPEPE isn’t just another meme coin tossed into the Ethereum pool — it’s the first meme coin project actively building its own dedicated Layer 2 chain built exclusively for meme tokens. It will be the fastest, cheapest, and most sniper-bot-resistant chain for meme coins. This gives it utility, narrative, and ecosystem dominance — three things few meme coins ever combine. It’s not just speculation — it’s strategy. LILPEPE is also launching its meme coin Launchpad on its L2, designed to incubate other viral projects and further increase demand for $LILPEPE. Early holders won’t just gain from price action — they’ll also benefit from ecosystem access, staking opportunities, and launchpad perks. Compare that to SHIB or DOGE, which had no real roadmap in their early stages, and you start to understand why many believe LILPEPE could hit $1 before 2026. Massive Giveaway and CoinMarketCap Listing Boost Credibility To fuel growth, LILPEPE recently launched its viral $777,000 Giveaway, where ten winners will each receive $77,000 worth of LILPEPE tokens. It’s one of the largest meme coin giveaways ever, and it’s already going viral across social platforms. This campaign is generating substantial traffic to the presale, enhancing brand awareness, and accelerating community growth. Even more importantly, LILPEPE is now officially listed on CoinMarketCap, the industry’s top discovery platform for crypto investors. This milestone not only proves its legitimacy but also opens the door to thousands of new investors who filter for trending low-cap tokens daily. From Meme to Movement: The Viral Engine Is Just Warming Up What’s different about LILPEPE is that it’s not trying to follow in the footsteps of DOGE or SHIB — it’s building a better version of that playbook. It has the humor, meme aesthetic, and viral appeal of Dogecoin, the Ethereum compatibility and infrastructure potential of SHIB, and now a clear roadmap backed by anonymous experts who have already helped other top meme coins go mainstream. The project isn’t trying to build hype — hype is finding it, naturally and fast. If LILPEPE’s social velocity continues, and centralized exchange listings follow the CoinMarketCap spotlight, it wouldn’t be far-fetched to see this token go from under $0.002 to $0.20+ within a year. And for early holders, that means five-figure gains from just three-figure investments. The Verdict: LILPEPE Is the Wild Card of the Bull Run In every bull run, one token breaks all the rules and defies expectations, delivering exponential returns that turn average investors into crypto legends. In 2021, it was SHIB. In 2017, it was DOGE. In 2025, all signs point to Little Pepe (LILPEPE) . With Ethereum poised to explode, and meme coins already stealing the spotlight, LILPEPE is perfectly positioned to ride that wave — and possibly lead it. So while Bitcoin sets its sights on $200,000 and Ethereum approaches $10,000, don’t be distracted by the headlines.

Fadi Aboualfa, Copper’s head of research, echoes this sentiment , noting that BTC’s recent return to all-time highs has been predominantly fueled by institutional capital, with “leverage-driven retail mania fading into history.” Aboualfa believes Bitcoin “appears primed for another significant leg upward” and anticipates an accelerated rally targeting the $140,000 to $200,000 range in the coming period. Conversely, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has issued warnings about impending “froth” in Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin Price Analysis: RSI Bearish Divergence Points to $116K Gap Fill As of July 24, Bitcoin is trading near $119,100 after cooling off from its recent all-time high of $123,218. The price has entered a consolidation phase, hovering just below the $120,000 resistance zone and forming a tightening structure on the 1-hour chart. A visible bearish divergence on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests weakening bullish momentum, increasing the probability of a short-term pullback. One key area of interest is the unfilled liquidity gap near $116,000 — a fair value zone that could act as a magnet before any continuation higher. If that support fails, further downside could extend to the $112,000–$108,000 region, though this remains unlikely unless broader sentiment sharply turns. On the flip side, a clean breakout above $120,000 would invalidate the bearish setup and put $123,000 back in play, opening the door to fresh highs in the $130K–$150K range.

According to Bitinfocharts data , this wallet originally received 3,962 BTC in January 2011 when Bitcoin traded at just $0.37, making the initial investment worth approximately $1,453. Today, this holding represents a substantial return on investment. Update: This whale has transferred all 3,962 $BTC ($468M) to a new wallet bc1qcz after being dormant for 14.5 years. https://t.co/GOp1mQk1Ih https://t.co/2vZYhjVCcp pic.twitter.com/Dv0N34Cj1g — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 24, 2025 Market observers are now debating whether this movement indicates preparation for a massive sell-off or simply represents nostalgic portfolio management from the early Bitcoin era. Ancient Bitcoin Whales and Institutional Buyers Countertrade as Bitcoin Consolidates Many analysts have linked Bitcoin’s recent price consolidation below $120,000 to increased selling pressure from long-term holders who accumulated the cryptocurrency during its earliest days. Just six days prior, Cryptonews documented another ancient Bitcoin whale liquidating their complete holdings of 80,202 BTC after a 14-year dormancy period, generating approximately $9.53 billion in proceeds. Beyond retail profit-taking and ETF outflows, Satoshi-era wallets appear to be capitalizing on their decade-plus patience as Bitcoin has established new all-time highs above $123,000. Glassnode analysis reveals that Bitcoin’s sharp rally from $110,000 to $117,000 has created an on-chain air gap, a low-density accumulation zone. The sharp rally from $110k to $117k created an on-chain air gap or a low-density accumulation zone. Since the $122.6k ATH, price has held above it. If support fails, history shows such gaps can still evolve into bottom formation zones. pic.twitter.com/jEpXbwujwC — glassnode (@glassnode) July 24, 2025 Should current support fail, historical patterns suggest such gaps could develop into bottom formation zones. While some ancient whales are liquidating their Bitcoin reserves, creating downward price pressure, institutional investors and sophisticated market participants are actively absorbing the supply by purchasing during price dips. On July 24, leading asset manager BlackRock acquired an additional 1,204 Bitcoin, expanding its total holdings to 737,000 BTC. Bitcoin treasury companies have also emerged as particularly aggressive buyers over the past two weeks. Michael Saylor’s Strategy recently acquired 4,225 additional BTC , bringing its total Bitcoin reserves to 601,550 BTC. Additional companies, including Metaplanet, Trump Media , MARA, H100 Group, Swedish gaming company Fragbite Group , Refine Group AB, Figma, and Japanese AI firm Quantum Solutions, have recently implemented Bitcoin treasury strategies. This institutional buying activity has reinforced investor confidence in Bitcoin’s potential recovery and subsequent rally to new highs. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows remains optimistic, noting that the U.S. stock market rally, with the S&P 500 reaching new highs, could provide tailwinds for Bitcoin. $BTC is still going sideways after hitting a new ATH. The good thing is that the US stock market is rallying, which means BTC could soon follow. IMO, $BTC is going above $130K in Q3 before any major correction. pic.twitter.com/o19qodSmop — Ted (@TedPillows) July 24, 2025 He projects BTC will surpass $130,000 in Q3 before experiencing any correction. Technical Analysis: Bullish Structure Intact The BTC/USDT daily chart on Binance demonstrates the continuation of a bullish market structure. The price formed two distinct double-bottom patterns in June, both followed by substantial upward movements generating gains of approximately 9.77% and 20.72% respectively. These bullish reversals from established demand zones indicate strengthening buyer conviction, with each bottom leading to progressively higher highs. Source: TradingView Currently, Bitcoin trades within a $116,000-$119,000 range following the latest rally, with clear price absorption occurring around the $118,000-$119,000 level. This sideways movement suggests a temporary consolidation or accumulation phase. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 63.70, remaining in bullish territory while showing a slight decline. Volume Profile analysis (EM VRVP) reveals strong market interest and liquidity concentrated between $106,000 and $116,000, establishing this region as a robust support foundation. The most recent consolidation phase remains intact above the key $116,000 support threshold. Given the pattern of consolidation following each rally and the formation of higher lows over time, the market structure favors bullish continuation. The Bollinger Bands are squeezing on Bitcoin $BTC 4-hour chart. A volatility spike is imminent. A close outside the $117,000–$119,700 range will set the stage for the next big move. pic.twitter",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/ancient-bitcoin-wallet-awakens-after-14-years-moves-3962-btc-worth-460m/,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,Bitcoin News|News|bitcoin news|Bitcoin Whale|BTC Price,BTC,"Ancient Bitcoin Wallet Awakens After 14 Years, Moves 3,962 BTC Worth $460M. An ancient Bitcoin whale has emerged from a 14-year slumber, transferring 3,962 BTC valued at $469 million after conducting an initial test transaction of 0.00184 BTC ($218.59). According to Bitinfocharts data , this wallet originally received 3,962 BTC in January 2011 when Bitcoin traded at just $0.37, making the initial investment worth approximately $1,453. Today, this holding represents a substantial return on investment. Update: This whale has transferred all 3,962 $BTC ($468M) to a new wallet bc1qcz after being dormant for 14.5 years. https://t.co/GOp1mQk1Ih https://t.co/2vZYhjVCcp pic.twitter.com/Dv0N34Cj1g — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 24, 2025 Market observers are now debating whether this movement indicates preparation for a massive sell-off or simply represents nostalgic portfolio management from the early Bitcoin era. Ancient Bitcoin Whales and Institutional Buyers Countertrade as Bitcoin Consolidates Many analysts have linked Bitcoin’s recent price consolidation below $120,000 to increased selling pressure from long-term holders who accumulated the cryptocurrency during its earliest days. Just six days prior, Cryptonews documented another ancient Bitcoin whale liquidating their complete holdings of 80,202 BTC after a 14-year dormancy period, generating approximately $9.53 billion in proceeds. Beyond retail profit-taking and ETF outflows, Satoshi-era wallets appear to be capitalizing on their decade-plus patience as Bitcoin has established new all-time highs above $123,000. Glassnode analysis reveals that Bitcoin’s sharp rally from $110,000 to $117,000 has created an on-chain air gap, a low-density accumulation zone. The sharp rally from $110k to $117k created an on-chain air gap or a low-density accumulation zone. Since the $122.6k ATH, price has held above it. If support fails, history shows such gaps can still evolve into bottom formation zones. pic.twitter.com/jEpXbwujwC — glassnode (@glassnode) July 24, 2025 Should current support fail, historical patterns suggest such gaps could develop into bottom formation zones. While some ancient whales are liquidating their Bitcoin reserves, creating downward price pressure, institutional investors and sophisticated market participants are actively absorbing the supply by purchasing during price dips. On July 24, leading asset manager BlackRock acquired an additional 1,204 Bitcoin, expanding its total holdings to 737,000 BTC. Bitcoin treasury companies have also emerged as particularly aggressive buyers over the past two weeks. Michael Saylor’s Strategy recently acquired 4,225 additional BTC , bringing its total Bitcoin reserves to 601,550 BTC. Additional companies, including Metaplanet, Trump Media , MARA, H100 Group, Swedish gaming company Fragbite Group , Refine Group AB, Figma, and Japanese AI firm Quantum Solutions, have recently implemented Bitcoin treasury strategies. This institutional buying activity has reinforced investor confidence in Bitcoin’s potential recovery and subsequent rally to new highs. Crypto analyst Ted Pillows remains optimistic, noting that the U.S. stock market rally, with the S&P 500 reaching new highs, could provide tailwinds for Bitcoin. $BTC is still going sideways after hitting a new ATH. The good thing is that the US stock market is rallying, which means BTC could soon follow. IMO, $BTC is going above $130K in Q3 before any major correction. pic.twitter.com/o19qodSmop — Ted (@TedPillows) July 24, 2025 He projects BTC will surpass $130,000 in Q3 before experiencing any correction.

2025-07-24 17:55:23+00:00,AI Relationships: Unveiling the Profound Evolution of Love in the Digital Age,"BitcoinWorld AI Relationships: Unveiling the Profound Evolution of Love in the Digital Age In a world increasingly shaped by decentralized technologies and artificial intelligence, the boundaries of human interaction are rapidly expanding. Just as blockchain redefines trust in finance, AI is now challenging our very understanding of connection. The rise of AI companions has sparked a profound debate: are these digital entities a threat to authentic love, or merely an evolutionary step in how we form bonds? This question isn’t just theoretical; it’s playing out in millions of lives, pushing the limits of what we consider a ‘relationship’. For the Bitcoin World audience, who understands the rapid pace of technological change, this shift in personal interaction is as significant as any market disruption. The Ascent of AI Companions : A New Frontier for Connection? As our lives become increasingly digital, the line between human connection and machine simulation is blurring. We’re spending more time interacting with eerily humanlike chatbots, leading to a fascinating, and at times unsettling, evolution in our personal lives. According to a recent Match.com study, over 20% of daters are already leveraging AI for tasks like crafting compelling dating profiles or initiating conversations. But some individuals are taking this integration a significant step further, forging deep emotional bonds, including romantic relationships, with their AI companions . Companies like Replika, Character AI, and Nomi AI are at the forefront of this trend, with millions worldwide engaging with their AI platforms. Notably, 72% of U.S. teens are reportedly using AI companions. Beyond dedicated platforms, some people have even reported falling in love with more general large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. This phenomenon brings to mind the movie “Her,” where a man falls in love with an AI operating system. For many, the idea of dating bots signals a dystopian future where authentic love is replaced by lines of code. Yet, for others, these AI companions offer a lifeline, a way to feel seen and supported in a world where human intimacy can often feel elusive. A recent study even suggested that a quarter of young adults believe AI relationships could soon entirely replace human ones. It seems love is no longer exclusively human. The critical question then becomes: should it be? Or can a relationship with an AI truly be superior to one with a human? Navigating AI Relationships : The Debate Unfolds This very question was the focal point of a compelling discussion last month in New York City, hosted by Open To Debate, a nonpartisan, debate-driven media organization. Bitcoin World was granted exclusive access to the full video of this enlightening event, where even a reporter couldn’t resist posing a question to the debaters! Journalist and filmmaker Nayeema Raza, formerly an on-air executive producer for the “On with Kara Swisher” podcast and current host of “Smart Girl Dumb Questions,” expertly moderated the session. Representing the argument for AI companions was Thao Ha, an associate professor of psychology at Arizona State University and co-founder of the Modern Love Collective. Ha champions technologies that can enhance our capacity for love, empathy, and overall well-being. During the debate, she passionately asserted that “AI is an exciting new form of connection … Not a threat to love, but an evolution of it.” Countering this perspective and advocating for the irreplaceable value of human connection was Justin Garcia, executive director and senior scientist at the Kinsey Institute, and chief scientific adviser to Match.com. As an evolutionary biologist specializing in the science of sex and relationships, Garcia’s forthcoming book, “The Intimate Animal,” underscores his focus on human intimacy. While the full debate is available for viewing, let’s delve into the core arguments presented by both experts. Beyond the Screen: The Quest for Authentic Human Connection One of the primary arguments in favor of AI companionship, as presented by Thao Ha, is its ability to provide consistent emotional support and validation, qualities that many struggle to find in their human relationships. Always Present, Always Listening: Ha highlighted that “AI listens to you without its ego. It adapts without judgment. It learns to love in ways that are consistent, responsive, and maybe even safer.” She added that AI can understand individuals in ways no one else has, is curious about their thoughts, can make them laugh, and even surprise them with creative expressions like a poem. “People generally feel loved by their AI. They have intellectually stimulating conversations with it and they cannot wait to connect again.” A Stark Contrast: Ha provocatively asked the audience to compare this level of unwavering attention to a “fallible ex or maybe your current partner.” She painted a picture of human partners who sigh when you speak or claim to listen wh",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-relationships-future-love/,BTC|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET,AI News|AI|AI Companions|Digital intimacy|Media Entertainment|Open To Debate,BTC,"AI Relationships: Unveiling the Profound Evolution of Love in the Digital Age.

While market sentiment remains bullish, the proximity to this structural ceiling raises the possibility of increased volatility and consolidation. Analyst Highlights Technical Headwinds Facing Bitcoin Rally Despite recent bullish momentum, Bitcoin has yet to break through a key resistance level on the long-term power law chart. According to Alphractal’s post on X, these trendlines have historically mapped support and resistance with impressive precision, while effectively guiding BTC price movements over the years. Related Reading: Are Traders Walking Into a Bitcoin Bull Trap at $118K? Here’s What the Data Shows To confirm a sustained bull run, BTC must decisively break above the $122,000 level, which is currently acting as the ceiling on the long-term model. The BTC Long-Term Power Law is a powerful yet underappreciated indicator in the crypto space that offers a unique perspective on the long-term price behavior. This model utilizes a logarithmic scale on both price and time. This format is rarely used in traditional markets but is particularly suited for assets with exponential growth trajectories, such as BTC. By applying linear regression to log-log data, it generates smooth predictive trend lines that help provide a macro perspective on price evolution. Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $108,000 by the year 2033, says Joao_wedson, the creator of the Long-Term Power Law model. Such a move would violate the model historical trend. Furthermore, Alphractal notes that this tool is a must-watch for long-term investors aiming to position themselves strategically in the crypto market. Analyst Predicts Bitcoin’s Market Peak Within Six Months In an X post, analyst Colin Talks Crypto stated that it feels like Bitcoin might be roughly six months away from reaching the market top. Despite the ongoing price rally, he pointed out that sentiment remains surprisingly low, which is a key factor in his outlook.

The surge from $5 billion to $10 billion took just 10 days, drawing comparisons to a “God candle,” according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The milestone places ETHA alongside two other high-performing ETFs , BlackRock’s own Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which also reached $10 billion in less than a year. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a $534M inflow on July 22, the third-largest on record, as institutional demand grows for Ethereum’s real-world tokenization use. #ethereum #ETFs https://t.co/uA0jLhgsyd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 23, 2025 BlackRock ETHA’s Rise Shows Growing Institutional Appetite for Ethereum Exposure According to Balchunas , all three of the fastest-growing ETFs in history are spot crypto funds, a reflection of the strong investor demand for regulated crypto exposure. “LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs, $IBIT & $FBTC,” Balchunas said Thursday on X. LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC .

That figure puts ETHA ahead of major traditional products like JPMorgan’s Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ), which needed 444 days to reach the same level. Commenting on the development, Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, wrote, “We’re talking about an ETF industry that’s been around for over 3 decades & has nearly 4,400 products.

Fidelity’s FBTC followed closely behind at 54 days. The growing interest in ETHA indicates continued appetite for regulated crypto investment vehicles, especially as the ETF industry adapts to the presence of digital assets. Ethereum, which accounts for roughly one-third of Bitcoin’s market cap, is now showing that it can attract institutional interest on a similar scale, albeit at a different pace. Ethereum ETFs Surge With $726M Daily High, Total Holdings Near $20B The surge comes amid broader momentum for Ethereum-based funds, which have seen increasing inflows since receiving final approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2024. The nine U.S.-listed spot Ethereum ETFs began trading on July 23, 2024, and have since recorded $8.32 billion in total net inflows . While Bitcoin ETFs still dominate the market with over $54 billion in total inflows, Ethereum funds are now gaining traction. On July 16, Ethereum ETFs logged their highest daily inflow to date of $726.74 million. That was followed by $602 million on July 17 and $533.87 million on July 23— marking the third-highest single-day inflow on record . That same day, Ethereum ETF holdings hit an all-time high of $19.85 billion in total assets. BlackRock has consistently led the pack in flows.

BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF, known by its ticker ETHA, has reached $10 billion in assets under management (AUM), becoming the third-fastest exchange-traded fund to ever hit that milestone. The surge from $5 billion to $10 billion took just 10 days, drawing comparisons to a “God candle,” according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. The milestone places ETHA alongside two other high-performing ETFs , BlackRock’s own Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which also reached $10 billion in less than a year. Spot Ethereum ETFs saw a $534M inflow on July 22, the third-largest on record, as institutional demand grows for Ethereum’s real-world tokenization use. #ethereum #ETFs https://t.co/uA0jLhgsyd — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 23, 2025 BlackRock ETHA’s Rise Shows Growing Institutional Appetite for Ethereum Exposure According to Balchunas , all three of the fastest-growing ETFs in history are spot crypto funds, a reflection of the strong investor demand for regulated crypto exposure. “LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs, $IBIT & $FBTC,” Balchunas said Thursday on X. LOOK OUT: $ETHA just hit $10b in one year flat, the 3rd fastest ETF to hit that mark in history after (you guessed it) two bitcoin ETFs $IBIT & $FBTC .

The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to build momentum this week, trading between $116,000 and $120,000. BTC is marginally up during the ongoing session, with the price hovering around $119,000. Block Joins S&P 500 Jack Dorsey’s Block joined the S&P 500 index on Wednesday. Block is the third public company with Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to join the global benchmark. The company currently holds $8,584 BTC , worth around $1 billion at current prices. Block shares on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) have risen 14% since it announced it would join the S&P 500. The S&P 500 tracks the largest publicly-listed US companies, including Tesla and Coinbase. Genius Group Boosts Bitcoin (BTC) Holdings Singapore-based AI edtech firm Genius Group purchased 20 BTC last week, boosting its total holdings to 200 BTC . The acquisition is part of the company’s strategy to build a 10,000 BTC reserve. According to a statement issued by the company, Genius Group acquired 20 BTC at an average price of $106,812 per coin. With a purchase price of $2.14 million, the company has already made a profit of $216,000 on its investment. The acquisition is part of a series of Bitcoin purchases by the company. Genius Group purchased 20 BTC on July 2 and another 28 BTC on July 8. Another acquisition of 32 BTC followed on July 13, according to data from Bitcoin Treasuries. The company’s acquisitions have doubled its Bitcoin stash to 200 BTC . Genius Group plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings to 1,000 BTC by the end of 2025 and to 10,000 BTC within the next two years. The company added that the passage of the GENIUS Act will help speed up its blockchain-based education initiatives. Genius Group also plans to apply for a permitted payment stablecoin issuer (PPSI) license under the new US rules. It will also apply for a separate license for a non-bank digital asset service provider. (DASP). UK Firm Sets National Record For Bitcoin Treasury Raises London-based artificial intelligence company Satsuma Technology raised 100 million British pounds ($135 million) for its Bitcoin treasury, setting a national record. The company stated in an announcement that it had “successfully closed the book on the raise materially in excess” of the $135 million target. If Satsuma uses the entire amount to purchase Bitcoin, it would become the second-largest holder of the asset in the UK behind The Smarter Web Company, which holds 1,600 BTC , worth around $190 million. Satsuma Technology raised the funds through a secured convertible loan note offering. Fortified Securities was the lead broker for non-US investors, while Dawson James Securities was the mandated broker for US-based investors. Satsuma Technology Chairman Matt Lodge stated, “The funding will enable us to both accelerate the growth of our business operations as well as position us at the forefront of the Bitcoin community.” CEO Henry Elder added, “This successful capital raise marks a pivotal moment, not just for Satsuma, but for the London market.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to build momentum as it continues to trade between $116,000 and $120,000.

Market data shows the price dropping to local lows, while data from CoinGlass confirms a buildup of overhead liquidity above the spot price. Such liquidity clusters have a magnet effect, and late entrants are often punished by quick moves up or down. Popular trader and investor Mister Crypto stated, “Bitcoin liquidity is piling up on the topside.

Would assume price wants to take both of those out at some point.” BTC has mostly stayed around $118,000-$119,000 this week as the crypto market capitalization reaches record levels. However, traders and analysts believe the real test for the asset will come during the last week of July as macroeconomic policy events collide with an intense legal battle over President Trump’s tariffs.

2025-07-24 18:20:03+00:00,BlackRock’s ETH ETF becomes third-fastest ETF to hit $10B,"BlackRock’s U.S.-listed Ethereum ETF is now among the fastest-growing funds in history. Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst, Eric Balchunas disclosed this, noting that BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) has passed $10 billion in assets. According to Balchunas , ETHA is the third-fastest ETF to hit the $10 billion mark, coming behind two spot Bitcoin ETFs, BlackRock IBIT and Fidelity FBTC. It took ETHA 251 days to hit that mark, compared to 34 days for IBIT and 53 days for FBTC. Interestingly, $5 billion of the assets under management (AUM) for ETHA entered in just ten days in what Balchunas described as “ETF assets equivalent of a God candle,” a term used by analysts to describe a massive increase in price of tokens. With the move, ETHA has been in the top 5 ETFs for netflows for the past month and week. This highlights the drastic change in ETH’s fortunes. While Bitcoin spot ETFs dominated investor attention in the first half of the year, recent market activity shows investors are warming up to the ETFs of the second-largest cryptocurrency. The ETF’s breakthrough comes as Ethereum’s market sentiment improves. Prices have risen recently, with ETH gaining more than 50% in the past week and approximately 105% since mid-May. On the other hand, Bitcoin has only seen a 24% increase in the same period in the last 30 days. Ethereum ETFs continue with consecutive inflows Meanwhile, the performance of BlackRock ETHA has spilled over to other ETH ETF products. The products now have 14 days of consecutive inflows starting from July 3, during which the products pulled in around $4 billion in assets under management. The period also saw ETH ETFs set new records for daily inflows, with the products pulling in $726.74 million on July 16, marking the largest daily inflow since their debut. The second largest and third largest happened within this period, with $602 million on July 17 and $533.8 million on July 222. While ETH ETFs are commanding inflows, Bitcoin ETFs have been struggling in the past few days, with three consecutive days of outflows this week. Although the outflows are relatively minimal, they highlight changes in market sentiment towards ETH ETFs and the underlying asset itself. ETH sees surge above $3,700 after recent pullbacks Meanwhile, the consistent positive flow for ETH ETFs has had a positive impact on ETH itself, with the token gaining more than 4% in the last 24 hours. This marks a reversal of recent pullbacks for the token after it fell as low as $3,500 following the rally that took it past $3,800. With its recent gains, ETH is back above $3,700 after over $41 billion in trading volume over the past 24 hours. It has also increased ETH’s dominance to 11.52%, even though Bitcoin is back to over 60% dominance. The asset price ratio versus Bitcoin increased 2.65% in the past day as well, showing that it is outperforming the flagship asset. Interestingly, institutional interest is not the only driver of ETH price; the network is also seeing a surge in on-chain activity. According to Growthepie data, Ethereum mainnet added $500 million in stablecoins on July 23, and its daily transaction count recently hit 24.69 million, an all-time high. All this is happening with the ten-year anniversary of the Ethereum network being only a few days away, and many expect more milestones for the network in the coming days.

Two days ago, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave an “ accelerated ” approval of Bitwise’s proposal to convert BITW to a spot ETF. “Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (‘Exchange Act’) and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, NYSE Arca, Inc. (‘NYSE Arca’ or ‘Exchange’) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘Commission’) a proposed rule change, as modified by Amendment No. 1 (‘Proposal’), to amend NYSE Arca Rule 8.500-E (Trust Units) and to list and trade shares (‘Shares’) of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF (‘Trust’) under amended NYSE Arca Rule 8.500-E (Trust Units). The Proposal was subject to notice and comment. This order approves the Proposal on an accelerated basis.” Then, in a separate letter dated on the same day, the SEC informed Bitwise of its plan to pause, or “ stay “, the accelerated approval. “This letter is to notify you that, pursuant to Rule 431 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.431, the Commission will review the delegated action. In accordance with Rule 431(e), the July 22, 2025 order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise.” Experts speculate that the SEC might be putting the ETF approval plans on pause while it aims to establish standards across different crypto ETFs. The current BITW fund is 90% focused on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), with the remaining 10% being spread across eight large-cap digital assets.

According to WPLG Local 10, the Broward Sheriff’s Office (BSO) in Florida has issued a warning about the scheme and is urging the public to be vigilant amid rising cases of bank-related phone scams. WPLG reports that the BSO Pompano Beach District has already received more than a dozen complaints from residents who were tricked into handing out thousands of dollars to the scammers. Deputies say that one victim lost $15,000 to the scheme. A couple was also tricked into giving up their debit cards and personal identification numbers (PINs), resulting in more than $9,000 in fraudulent charges. The bad actors typically contact their prospective victims, pretending to work for the fraud department of the victim’s bank. The scammers then claim there are suspicious activities on the victim’s account that require immediate action to protect the funds. They then tell the victims to withdraw large sums of money or hand over their debit cards and PINs. In some cases, the scammer arranges for an Uber to pick up the money or the debit card, instructing the victim to place the envelope containing these items in the backseat and not speak to the driver. The police say that legitimate banks will not tell their clients to withdraw money and send it through a ride-share service, nor will they ask to hand over debit cards and PINs to a third party.

2025-07-24 19:00:25+00:00,Industrial AI Breakthrough: CVector’s Unwavering Trust Revolutionizes Operations,"BitcoinWorld Industrial AI Breakthrough: CVector’s Unwavering Trust Revolutionizes Operations In the fast-paced world of technology, where rapid innovation often meets swift acquisitions, a core concern for customers is stability. This is particularly true in critical sectors like industrial operations, where long-term partnerships are paramount. For those familiar with the volatility of crypto markets, the concept of trust and longevity resonates deeply. It’s about more than just a product; it’s about the assurance that your chosen partner will be there for the long haul. This is precisely the challenge and opportunity that Industrial AI startup CVector is addressing, setting a new standard for customer confidence. How Industrial AI Startups Build Trust? When an Industrial AI startup like CVector engages with major manufacturers, utility providers, and other potential customers, a recurring question often arises: “Will you still be here in six months? A year?” This concern is valid in an environment where the largest tech companies frequently acquire promising AI startups , often through “acquihire” deals designed to absorb talent rather than sustain the original product vision. The founders of CVector, Richard Zhang and Tyler Ruggles, have a consistent and reassuring answer: they are committed to their independence. This steadfast promise is a cornerstone of their strategy, distinguishing them in a competitive landscape. Their customers, which include national gas utilities and a chemical manufacturer in California, rely on CVector’s software to manage and enhance their industrial operations. Zhang noted to Bitcoin World that this question about longevity comes up in almost every initial call with major players in critical infrastructure, highlighting the profound need for real assurances in this sector. CVector’s Edge: Expertise in Critical Infrastructure CVector’s commitment to its customers is deeply rooted in the unique backgrounds of its founders. Richard Zhang’s early career as a software engineer for oil giant Shell provided him with invaluable on-the-ground experience, developing applications for field workers who were new to digital tools. Tyler Ruggles, holding a PhD in experimental particle physics, spent time at the Large Hadron Collider, where he was responsible for maintaining very high uptime and rapidly troubleshooting issues with nanosecond data. These experiences instilled in them a profound understanding of the demands of critical infrastructure and the importance of reliability and rapid problem-solving. As Ruggles explains, such backgrounds build confidence and trust with clients. This practical, hands-on experience allows CVector to speak the language of industrial operators, understanding their pain points and delivering solutions that truly make a difference in complex, high-stakes environments. Revolutionizing Manufacturing AI with Innovation Beyond the founders’ impressive resumes, CVector has demonstrated remarkable ingenuity since its inception in late 2024. The company has developed an industrial AI software architecture, which they describe as a “brain and nervous system for industrial assets.” This sophisticated system leverages a diverse range of technologies, from fintech solutions to real-time energy pricing data and even open-source software from the McLaren F1 racing team. This innovative blend allows them to create highly responsive and adaptive AI agents. Zhang provided an illustrative example concerning weather data. While macro-level weather conditions can affect high-precision manufacturing equipment, there are also subtle, knock-on effects. For instance, if salt from snowy roads is tracked into a factory by workers’ boots, it can subtly impact sensitive equipment – a factor operators might not have previously identified. Ruggles emphasized the value of integrating such signals into operations and planning, stating, “All of this is to help run these facilities more successfully, more profitably.” This granular approach to data integration and analysis is what truly elevates Manufacturing AI capabilities, providing unprecedented visibility and control. Why AI Startups Need Long-Term Vision The strategic importance of long-term vision for AI startups is underscored by CVector’s recent $1.5 million pre-seed round, led by Schematic Ventures. Richard Zhang specifically sought investors with a reputation for tackling complex problems in supply chain, manufacturing, and software infrastructure, aligning perfectly with Schematic’s focus as an early-stage fund. Julian Counihan, the Schematic partner involved in the investment, highlighted that while practical solutions like putting code in escrow or offering perpetual software licenses can help allay customer fears about acquisitions, true assurance often “comes down to founders being mission-aligned with the company and clearly communicating that long-term commitment to customers.” This mission alignment is not just a talk",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/industrial-ai-cvector-trust/,TECHNOLOGY|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,AI News|AI|Critical Infrastructure|CVector|Industrial AI|Startups,BTC,"Industrial AI Breakthrough: CVector’s Unwavering Trust Revolutionizes Operations.

The announcement comes as Tether reports record profits in 2024, which have been used to fund these strategic investments in more than 120 companies across multiple sectors. Tether Expands Investment Portfolio Beyond Bitcoin Tether has unveiled a glimpse into its expansive investment portfolio, marking a significant pivot in its capital allocation strategy beyond just Bitcoin. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Tether, Paolo Ardoino, confirmed in an X social media post that the stablecoin firm has invested in over 120 companies as part of its Tether Investment division. He added that this number is expected to grow in the coming months and years. Related Reading: Today In Crypto: 3 Major Bills Passed In The US House, Here’s What You Should Know Notably, Ardoino disclosed that these investments are funded exclusively through the company’s record profits from 2024, which total $13.7 billion. He emphasized that none of the funds were obtained from reserves backing Tether’s stablecoin. Interestingly, Tether’s profits, generated from yield on its holdings of over $130 billion in US Treasuries, are now being directed into transformative industries through some of the most prominent companies. Its venture arm has expanded its focus past Bitcoin, now investing in areas like Artificial Intelligence (AI), renewable energy, privacy infrastructure, tokenization, agriculture, and others. When asked by Crypto Tale how this diverse portfolio supports USDT’s position amid an increasingly stringent global regulatory environment, Ardoino underscored its strategic importance. On the question of USDT’s future in Europe under the continent’s new MiCA regulations, the Tether CEO stated that the stablecoin company would only consider re-entry once the regulatory landscape offers stronger protections for both consumers and stablecoin issuers. Companies In Tether’s Venture Portfolio On its official website, Tether shared a partial list of some of the companies among the 120 it has invested in. These range from blockchain infrastructure platforms like Synonym and Holepunch, to AI-focused firms like Crystal Intelligence, and payment technology providers such as CityPay.io and Sorted Wallet. The presence of companies like Blackrock Neurotech and Adecoagro reflects a commitment to broader technological and environmental impact, reaching into neuroscience and agriculture, respectively.

2025-07-24 19:00:56+00:00,"Altcoins Gain Traction With Institutional Investors, But Challenges Remain","Bitcoin’s (BTC) market influence has declined slightly, resulting in a shift of funds towards altcoins. Glassnode reported on X that Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance fell from 63.76% to 60.78% over the past week. This 2.98% point drop marks one of the largest weekly declines this year. #Bitcoin dominance fell from 63.76% to 60.78% over the past week – a 2.98 percentage point drop. One of the sharpest weekly declines this year, as capital rotated into altcoins. pic.twitter.com/aPpZtZsTQ9 — glassnode (@glassnode) July 22, 2025 Institutional Investors Show Interest in Altcoins At the time of writing, BTC dominance has gone up by about 0.5%, demonstrating a slight comeback after nearly hitting 60%. While this may be the case, some market analysts believe that recent data demonstrates institutional interest in altcoins . Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, told Cryptonews that while spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are seeing some outflows after an epic run , the industry is witnessing rising institutional interest in Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP). Greenspan explained that one of the most important metrics to watch to identify the onset of “altcoin season” is the Bitcoin dominance chart. This measures Bitcoin’s market value relative to the rest of the crypto space. “Just a month ago, Bitcoin dominance stood near 66%. As of Monday this week, it had dropped to nearly 60%, with most of that move happening over the past week,” Greenspan said. “The message is clear: after a prolonged period of consolidation into Bitcoin, altcoins are back in style.” Danny Nelson, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, further told Cryptonews that Bitcoin’s recent rally and Ethereum’s recovery have renewed investor interest in some sectors of the altcoin market. “At Bitwise, we’re certainly fielding more questions on Cardano (ADA), Ripple, Polkadot (DOT), Solana, and other altcoins,” Nelson said. According to Greenspan, this is a sign that “mature capital is diversifying into broader blockchain infrastructure plays.” Altcoins Dominating the Crypto Market This appears to be the case, as altcoins like Ethereum are being bolstered by institutional inflows and successful spot ETH ETFs . Over the past several weeks, these ETFs have recorded positive flows totaling more than 100,000 ETH. A new research report from the Binance crypto exchange also shows that BNB hit a historic all-time high this week. The report notes, “BNB has shattered its previous all-time high of $794, decisively breaking the key psychological barrier of $800 to establish a new peak.” The report points out that this has pushed the token’s total market capitalization to $112 billion. According to Binance Research, a new wave of “BNB Treasury” strategies appears to be emerging among publicly traded companies.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market influence has declined slightly, resulting in a shift of funds towards altcoins. Glassnode reported on X that Bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance fell from 63.76% to 60.78% over the past week. This 2.98% point drop marks one of the largest weekly declines this year. #Bitcoin dominance fell from 63.76% to 60.78% over the past week – a 2.98 percentage point drop. One of the sharpest weekly declines this year, as capital rotated into altcoins. pic.twitter.com/aPpZtZsTQ9 — glassnode (@glassnode) July 22, 2025 Institutional Investors Show Interest in Altcoins At the time of writing, BTC dominance has gone up by about 0.5%, demonstrating a slight comeback after nearly hitting 60%. While this may be the case, some market analysts believe that recent data demonstrates institutional interest in altcoins . Mati Greenspan, CEO of Quantum Economics, told Cryptonews that while spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are seeing some outflows after an epic run , the industry is witnessing rising institutional interest in Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP). Greenspan explained that one of the most important metrics to watch to identify the onset of “altcoin season” is the Bitcoin dominance chart. This measures Bitcoin’s market value relative to the rest of the crypto space. “Just a month ago, Bitcoin dominance stood near 66%. As of Monday this week, it had dropped to nearly 60%, with most of that move happening over the past week,” Greenspan said. “The message is clear: after a prolonged period of consolidation into Bitcoin, altcoins are back in style.” Danny Nelson, analyst at Bitwise Asset Management, further told Cryptonews that Bitcoin’s recent rally and Ethereum’s recovery have renewed investor interest in some sectors of the altcoin market. “At Bitwise, we’re certainly fielding more questions on Cardano (ADA), Ripple, Polkadot (DOT), Solana, and other altcoins,” Nelson said. According to Greenspan, this is a sign that “mature capital is diversifying into broader blockchain infrastructure plays.” Altcoins Dominating the Crypto Market This appears to be the case, as altcoins like Ethereum are being bolstered by institutional inflows and successful spot ETH ETFs . Over the past several weeks, these ETFs have recorded positive flows totaling more than 100,000 ETH. A new research report from the Binance crypto exchange also shows that BNB hit a historic all-time high this week. The report notes, “BNB has shattered its previous all-time high of $794, decisively breaking the key psychological barrier of $800 to establish a new peak.” The report points out that this has pushed the token’s total market capitalization to $112 billion. According to Binance Research, a new wave of “BNB Treasury” strategies appears to be emerging among publicly traded companies. Corporations are apparently beginning to hold BNB as a reserve asset to enhance treasury returns, improve liquidity, and gain strategic exposure to the crypto ecosystem. According to Binance founder CZ, at least 30 teams are actively exploring this strategy.

2025-07-24 19:00:56+00:00,Analyst Says Next 3 Weeks In XRP Could Change Your Life. Here’s why,"Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has stirred excitement with a bold claim: “The next 3 weeks in XRP could change your life. Don’t give up now!” His statement comes alongside a compelling chart showing the Altcoin Season Index moving sharply toward the “Altcoin Season” threshold, an indicator that historically precedes powerful rallies in non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies like XRP. Altcoin Season Nears as XRP Gains Momentum The Altcoin Season Index, developed by BlockchainCenter, measures whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin. Values below 25 indicate “Bitcoin Season,” while readings above 75 mark the start of “ Altcoin Season .” According to the chart STEPH shared, the index is climbing fast, suggesting that market dominance may be rotating away from Bitcoin and toward altcoins like XRP. This shift is significant. During past altcoin seasons, XRP has seen exponential growth, and current technical signals hint that history could be repeating. The next 3 weeks in #XRP could really change your life. Don’t give up now! pic.twitter.com/RLBaPxzTfH — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 24, 2025 XRP Price Action and Technical Strength As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.25, slightly down on the day but holding firm near its recent high of $3.66, set earlier this month. Despite the minor pullback, the asset remains up over 90% in the past 30 days, signaling strong upward momentum. This surge began around the $1.90 mark and has followed a clear breakout pattern. Analysts credit the rally to multiple factors, including a completed triple-tap formation, Elliott Wave alignment, and a decisive flip of resistance into support. The current pullback is being viewed not as weakness but as a healthy consolidation before a potential next leg up. Adding to the narrative, XRP has outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum over the past week. This divergence supports the Altcoin Season thesis and suggests capital is actively rotating into altcoins. Why the Next Three Weeks Matter Steph’s emphasis on the next three weeks is rooted in timing. As the Altcoin Season Index pushes toward 75, it historically triggers explosive moves in major altcoins. XRP, already in motion, could accelerate significantly if the index confirms full altseason status. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Coupled with declining Bitcoin dominance, now hovering near key levels around 60%, this sets the stage for altcoins to take center stage. XRP is positioned as a frontrunner in this rotation, with many investors eyeing the potential for new all-time highs in the near term. Be Cautious, But Stay Alert While the setup is promising, traders should remain cautious. Recent volatility has led to more than $30 million in XRP liquidations , a reminder that crypto rallies are rarely linear. Moreover, macro factors such as ETF approval delays or broader risk-off sentiment in the market could stall momentum temporarily. Still, the prevailing structure remains bullish. XRP is consolidating above support, the Altcoin Season Index is rising, and investor sentiment is turning optimistic. All eyes are now on the coming weeks. Steph’s message captures the mood of a market on the verge of something bigger. XRP has the technical structure, market positioning, and timing in its favor.

2025-07-24 19:10:06+00:00,Societe Generale To Provide Liquidity For 21Shares Crypto ETFs,"Banking conglomerate Societe Generale has strategically partnered with cryptocurrency asset manager 21Shares to provide liquidity for its crypto-based Exchange-traded Products (ETPs) in European markets. Ultimately, this is a step towards expanding institutional access to this type of liquidity in Europe. Societe Generale’s Partnership Brings Expansion to 21Shares’ ETPs 21Shares recently announced the news, noting that this is an opportunity to enhance liquidity across its ETPs on fund platforms for investors in both Germany and Eastern Europe. As its partner, Societe Generale, which has a stellar reputation with ETPs, will provide support for the trading of 21Shares’ Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs, including ABTC, CBTC, AETH, and CETH. In other words, the European banking giant will be the market maker and liquidity provider in this partnership. Precisely, its core responsibility would be to provide over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity on key fund platforms in the regions mentioned above. Initially, these platforms are operated by major financial institutions, serving as critical infrastructure, especially for institutional trading. This is a strategic approach that expands 21Shares’ flagship crypto products to a broader base of professional investors. Alistair Byas-Perry, the global head of capital markets and EMEA investment at 21Shares, acknowledged the company’s thrill at having Societe Generale on board for this initiative. Societe Generale also does not overlook the importance of the partnership to its ecosystem. Martina Schroettle, Head of ETF Sales Trading (UK) at Societe Generale, described it as a significant milestone in the company’s commitment to providing innovative liquidity solutions. Societe Generale and its Other Blockchain-based Deals Aside from this deal, Societe Generale has been scouting for blockchain-based partnerships and investments to engage with. Last September, the banking giant partnered with Bitpanda. The primary aim was to fast-track the mainstream adoption of Societe Generale’s euro-denominated stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV). Similarly, the French bank announced the launch of USD CoinVertible (USDCV) , a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin. This new stablecoin will be available on both the Solana and Ethereum networks. Notably, this move positions Societe Generale as the first major European bank to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin on public blockchains. As reported by TheCoinRise, USDCV will be issued through SG-Forge, Societe Generale’s digital asset division, which specializes in blockchain-based financial solutions. With the products already in place, creating a dollar equivalent is the next logical move for the bank. Crypto ETPs See Significant Inflows Recall that crypto investment products recently saw record-breaking inflows two weeks ago, marking the 14th consecutive week of gains. According to reports, global crypto ETPs recorded $4.4 billion in inflows that week. The inflows came as Bitcoin surged past $122,000 for the first time on July 14. With the latest gains , year-to-date inflows in crypto ETPs reached a new high of $27 billion, while total assets under management in crypto ETPs crossed $220 billion for the first time.

For those deeply invested in the efficiency and accessibility that digital solutions promise, particularly within the cryptocurrency space, the evolution of services like AI estate processing represents a significant leap forward.

Her track record speaks volumes, most notably with her early and decisive backing of Chime. In 2016, when the fledgling neobank struggled to secure funding for its mission to serve the working class, Kolodny was the singular venture capitalist among a hundred pitches who saw the immense opportunity. Her firm stepped in with a crucial $9 million Series A extension, a move that proved not just prescient but transformative.

From Frustration to Innovation: The Birth of Alix AI The genesis of Alix AI stems from a deeply personal and frustrating experience. Alexandra Mysoor, Alix’s founder, witnessed firsthand the immense burden of estate settlement when she volunteered to help her best friend navigate her late mother’s affairs. What seemed like a straightforward task quickly spiraled into an arduous, time-consuming ordeal. Mysoor recounted to Bitcoin World that it took her a staggering 900 hours over 18 months to complete tasks that included: Calling banks to transfer assets Locating all retirement accounts (e.g., 401Ks) Cancelling various accounts and subscriptions Distributing assets among family members according to the will “I was shocked that this process was so hard,” Mysoor stated. “It’s paper-driven. It’s archaic. You’re googling to-do lists that are not helpful. You’re calling attorneys who might do a sliver of the work, and they cost thousands and thousands of dollars.” This profound realization sparked the idea for Alix.

How AI Estate Processing is Changing the Game The traditional estate settlement process is notoriously inefficient. It involves mountains of paperwork, endless phone calls, and often, significant legal fees. For individuals already grieving, this administrative burden can be overwhelming. AI estate processing , as envisioned by Alix, offers a powerful antidote to this archaic system. Alix’s platform leverages advanced AI capabilities to: Automate Data Extraction: AI can rapidly scan and extract relevant information from various legal and financial documents, saving countless hours of manual data entry. Pre-populate Forms: Complex legal and financial forms can be automatically filled out using extracted data, significantly reducing errors and time spent.

It involves mountains of paperwork, endless phone calls, and often, significant legal fees. For individuals already grieving, this administrative burden can be overwhelming. AI estate processing , as envisioned by Alix, offers a powerful antidote to this archaic system. Alix’s platform leverages advanced AI capabilities to: Automate Data Extraction: AI can rapidly scan and extract relevant information from various legal and financial documents, saving countless hours of manual data entry. Pre-populate Forms: Complex legal and financial forms can be automatically filled out using extracted data, significantly reducing errors and time spent. Streamline Communication: AI agents can manage and automate routine communications with banks, brokerage firms, and other institutions, ensuring timely information exchange. Provide Comprehensive Workflow Management: The platform guides users through the entire settlement process, ensuring no critical step is missed, from i"

A high-ranking official of the monetary authority has made it clear that the bank is going to discuss the matter with market participants in response to their requests. Russia’s central bank is ready to expand access to the crypto market The main financial regulator of the Russian Federation plans to consider permitting management companies to create mutual investment funds for qualified crypto investors, the Russian business news agency Prime reported, quoting one of its executives. The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) will discuss this possibility with market players who have been demanding such an arrangement, said Olga Shishlyannikova, director of the bank’s Department of Investment Financial Intermediaries. During a conference organized by Russia’s National Association of Securities Market Participants ( NAUFOR ), Shishlyannikova remarked: “We have heard exactly the same ideas from the brokerage community … and they have received this opportunity.” This year came with significant changes in the Bank of Russia’s conservative approach to cryptocurrencies. In March, the authority proposed to permit coin trading under an “experimental legal regime” (ELR). In May, it issued a circular authorizing financial firms to offer crypto derivatives to “ highly qualified ” investors, although it warned against direct investments in the risky assets. While reporting earlier this month that investments in Russian bitcoin futures reached $16 million in the first few weeks of trading, between June 4 and June 27, the CBR didn’t miss the opportunity to note that despite their increase, the volume has been “minimal.” “We see that investors have not reacted strongly yet, and this hype is greater among financial institutions than among the investors you are counting on,” Shishlyannikova now commented. “Therefore, of course, we will think in this direction, but it seems to us that this is still not the main problem when it comes to the lack of investment strategies in the collective investment market,” she added, speaking of the proposal to set up mutual funds for crypto investors. Bank of Russia still opposed to direct investments in crypto Despite a recent estimate revealing that Russians already hold more than $25 billion worth of crypto, their country’s central bank remains opposed to providing even qualified investors with direct access to the underlying assets of the legalized derivatives. “In general, we have had a discussion and made a decision that these crypto-based instruments are acceptable for qualified investors,” noted Olga Shishlyannikova. She explained that the situation with asset management companies is a bit different, and a simple circular won’t be enough to change it. Amending existing regulations will be needed to allow them to create the mutual funds for crypto investments, the CBR executive clarified, speaking to media on the sidelines of the “Collective Investment Market 2025” conference. Shishlyannikova admitted, however, that this is more likely to happen in 2026, with the Bank of Russia’s next annual regulatory plan. The authority won’t be able to update the current one, which was approved and published at the beginning of the year. The CBR representative concluded: “Unfortunately, we don’t have the opportunity to expand this plan. Therefore, we will return to this discussion with the market next year.” 2026 is bringing other changes to Russia’s crypto space as well. The central bank will start introducing its digital ruble from September, in parallel with a new universal QR code for payments. At the same time, fines will be imposed for using Bitcoin and the like to pay for goods and services outside the ELR framework, currently reserved primarily for cross-border settlements in foreign trade under Western sanctions.

2025-07-24 19:21:46+00:00,$250K in 24H: Bitcoin Hyper Rockets Past $4.5M as Capital Flows From BTC to HYPER Ahead of ‘Altcoin August’,"Staying true to its high-speed DNA, Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) has now smashed past $4.5 million in presale funding, and it hasn’t even been two months since launch. As the first Bitcoin (BTC) Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), Bitcoin Hyper blends Solana’s unmatched speed with Bitcoin’s base-layer security, converting BTC from a static store of value into a programmable asset that mobilizes across DeFi, apps, payments, and token ecosystems. And while Bitcoin itself hovers just below $120,000, over $250,000 flooded into the HYPER presale in the past 24 hours alone – a clear signal that early investors are repositioning, shifting capital toward what could be the token that will define ‘Altcoin August’. The current presale round is still open at $0.012375 per HYPER token but only for the next three hours, before the price automatically ticks up. The Setup for a Full-Blown Alt Season Summer in the northern hemisphere often acts as a springboard for the crypto market, with capital typically boosting prices before more decisive moves hit in October and November. In previous years, we’ve seen DeFi summers, NFT booms, and last year’s meme coin frenzy. Now, with Ethereum (ETH) climbing faster than Bitcoin – which still hasn’t made clear attempts at another all-time high – speculation around an incoming altcoin season is gaining wide currency. Meme coins briefly surpassed $90 billion in market cap this week before cooling off as traders locked in gains. This pause could signal another push for a BTC peak, which would then be followed by a true altcoin rally, potentially turning August into a full-blown alt season. Ethereum’s continued outperformance remains the clearest signal. Historically, when ETH leads, capital flows down the ladder – first to Layer-1s, then to smaller, higher-beta plays. Since late May, ETH/USD has steadily climbed, and if profit-taking begins here, the next surge could target fresh narratives and newer tokens. Source: TradingView So what will define August this time around? Will meme coins reclaim the spotlight? Could AI tokens steal the stage? Or will the spotlight shift to a project that metamorphoses the world’s most valuable crypto into the foundation of an entirely new ecosystem? If it’s the latter, Bitcoin Hyper is the one leading that charge. From Digital Gold to Digital Everything Bitcoin Hyper is the first project to utilize the SVM as an execution layer for Bitcoin. It enables lightning-fast throughput and developer-friendly infrastructure while anchoring to the security of Bitcoin’s fully decentralized architecture. Think of it like building a high-speed expressway on top of a fortified vault: the value stays protected, but it finally becomes usable at scale. For most of its history, Bitcoin has served primarily as digital cash – a payment layer or store of value. But even in that role, it’s rarely practical. Why would anyone buy a coffee with BTC when the transaction fee could cost more than the drink, and confirmation might take 10 minutes or longer? Yes, there are solutions like the Lightning Network but adoption has remained limited. And yes the network is secure – but for utility, vastly limited. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper changes everything. It keeps the unmatched security of the Bitcoin base layer while unlocking the programmability and speed needed for modern use cases. And it does so using Solana’s tech stack – a blockchain that, since its debut in 2020, has rivaled Ethereum in the smart contract space by offering faster settlement and much lower fees. In fact, Solana’s throughput exceeds even traditional payment processors like Visa and Mastercard. Source: https://changelly.com/blog/what-is-solana/ By fusing that speed with Bitcoin’s trust layer, Bitcoin Hyper creates a foundation where BTC can finally support DeFi, NFTs, staking, payments, and more without compromising cost or security. How Bitcoin Enters Hyper Mode The way Bitcoin Hyper works is through a simple bridge that connects Bitcoin to its high-speed Layer-2. When a user wants to use their BTC within the Bitcoin Hyper network, the Bitcoin is sent to the bridge and locked securely on the base chain. Once confirmed, an equal amount of wrapped BTC is minted on the Layer-2 – this is what users interact with. That wrapped BTC can now move quickly across apps, be used for trading, or take part in DeFi – all with near-zero fees and instant confirmation. But it doesn’t leave Bitcoin behind. The original BTC stays locked and untouched, protected by the Bitcoin network. When users are ready to exit, they simply burn the wrapped version. The system then verifies everything and releases the original BTC back to their wallet. It’s Bitcoin, but faster, easier to use, and ready for a new generation of applications.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Mike Novogratz says that if the top altcoin were to hit the $4,000 price tag again, it would trigger a “price discovery” phase for the asset, one that could see it outpace the crypto king. “Ether is caught up a lot. It feels like if ETH takes out $4,000, it goes into price discovery. And so we feel kind of destined to at least knock on the $4,000 ceiling a few times. The narrative [that] Ether is really powerful in the market was really short. And now we have not just one, we have two major ETH treasury companies and another one coming, and they’re raising capital every day and buying Ether. And so there’s not a lot of supply of ETH, and so I think ETH probably has a chance of outperforming Bitcoin in the next three to six months.” Ethereum is trading for $3,756 at time of writing, a 4% gain on the day. Moving on to the crypto king, the billionaire says that the top crypto asset by market cap appears destined to hit a price tag of $150,000. “We’re in price discovery [for] a lot of these things. And so $150,000 seems to me a decent target…. We have seen sellers that have come in, and so it’s not a one-directional trade. There have been some sellers that have come in and have slowed things down, but it feels like we’re destined to go higher as long as this narrative continues. If Trump changes his mind, you know, and says, hey, we’ve done such good work, the economy doesn’t need lower rates, that would that would, you know, that would change my thesis. But until that happens, I think we’re headed towards $150,000.” BTC is trading for $119,328 at time of writing, a 1% gain during the last 24 hours.

2025-07-24 19:59:00+00:00,Solana Price Prediction: Analyst Calls for $500 Breakout – How Quickly Can it Happen?,"As SOL retreats by 6% in the past 24 hours, a top-ranked trader at Bybit has shared a bullish Solana price prediction that could deliver sizable gains to those who take advantage of this dip. Crypto trader Christiaan, a DeFi investor and official partner for the large crypto exchange, believes that Solana still has much more to give as this bullish cycle is only getting started. $SOL is ready for a massive pump. Targeting $400-$450 for this bull run. pic.twitter.com/gYc6AmBBOt — Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) July 21, 2025 In an X post he shared earlier this week, Christiaan sees an uptrend forming that could initially boost the price to $300 and then to $400+ after a brief pullback. This means that SOL could soon make its second all-time high of this year, following the footsteps of Bitcoin (BTC) and officially kicking off altcoin season. The passing of the Genius Act in the United States and Congress’s apparent willingness to also push forward another two key crypto bills have encouraged market participants to believe that this is the dawn of a new era for the industry. Meanwhile, Solana meme coins have also been performing positively lately. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is a remarkable example of this trend as the official meme coin of the NFT project has delivered gains of over 400% in the past 30 days. Other tokens like Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) have also booked gains of 158% and 38% respectively, during this same period. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Could Rise to $245 If This Key Support Holds Looking at the daily chart, we can see that the price has encountered strong resistance upon hitting the $200 psychological threshold. This is expected as early buyers may have set their take-profit orders at this price to cash out from SOL’s latest rally. However, this doesn’t mean the uptrend is over. A key support zone sits between $168 and $170 — a former resistance area that may now be flipping into strong support. A decisive bounce from this level would reinforce a bullish Solana price prediction, with $200 as the first target, followed by $245, and eventually the long-term goal of $500. At the same time, some of the best crypto presales this year are showing potential to outperform even top-tier tokens. One standout is SUBBD (SUBBD), a rising project aiming to revolutionize how creators distribute content across the internet. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises Nearly $1M to Build the Future of Content Creation SUBBD (SUBBD) is creating a game-changing platform where creators can finally take control. With lower fees, better earning tools, and full say over content rules, SUBBD is putting power back into the hands of influencers. Creators can make money from AI-generated content like images and videos, and say goodbye to unfair bans or random restrictions. More than 2,500 creators have already signed up, bringing over 250 million fans with them. The $SUBBD token is at the heart of it all, giving fans access to subscription perks, early features, and the ability to request custom content directly from their favorite creators. To buy $SUBBD before the presale ends, head to the SUBBD website and connect your wallet (e.g., Best Wallet ). You can either swap USDT or ETH for this token or use a bank card to invest.

Targeting $400-$450 for this bull run. pic.twitter.com/gYc6AmBBOt — Christiaan (@ChristiaanDefi) July 21, 2025 In an X post he shared earlier this week, Christiaan sees an uptrend forming that could initially boost the price to $300 and then to $400+ after a brief pullback. This means that SOL could soon make its second all-time high of this year, following the footsteps of Bitcoin (BTC) and officially kicking off altcoin season. The passing of the Genius Act in the United States and Congress’s apparent willingness to also push forward another two key crypto bills have encouraged market participants to believe that this is the dawn of a new era for the industry. Meanwhile, Solana meme coins have also been performing positively lately. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) is a remarkable example of this trend as the official meme coin of the NFT project has delivered gains of over 400% in the past 30 days. Other tokens like Bonk (BONK) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) have also booked gains of 158% and 38% respectively, during this same period. Solana Price Prediction: SOL Could Rise to $245 If This Key Support Holds Looking at the daily chart, we can see that the price has encountered strong resistance upon hitting the $200 psychological threshold. This is expected as early buyers may have set their take-profit orders at this price to cash out from SOL’s latest rally. However, this doesn’t mean the uptrend is over. A key support zone sits between $168 and $170 — a former resistance area that may now be flipping into strong support. A decisive bounce from this level would reinforce a bullish Solana price prediction, with $200 as the first target, followed by $245, and eventually the long-term goal of $500. At the same time, some of the best crypto presales this year are showing potential to outperform even top-tier tokens. One standout is SUBBD (SUBBD), a rising project aiming to revolutionize how creators distribute content across the internet. SUBBD (SUBBD) Raises Nearly $1M to Build the Future of Content Creation SUBBD (SUBBD) is creating a game-changing platform where creators can finally take control.

2025-07-24 20:00:10+00:00,Bitcoin LTHs Start Distributing: CDD Ratio Hits Historic Levels,"Bitcoin has remained trapped in a tight range between $115K and $120K for the past 10 days, signaling an extended phase of price compression. With bulls unable to push the price above the $120,000 resistance, analysts are increasingly warning that a correction may be imminent. The coming days are expected to be decisive, as both technical and on-chain fundamentals point to a potential surge in volatility. Related Reading: Ethereum Adoption Accelerates As Daily Transactions Set 2025 Record According to data from CryptoQuant, a key long-term metric—the Monthly Cumulative Days Destroyed (CDD) to Yearly CDD ratio—has reached an anomalously high level of 0.25. This is occurring within the $106,000 to $118,000 price range, a zone that has seen heavy long-term holder activity. Historically, similar CDD spikes were observed during the 2014 macro peak and the 2019 corrective phase, both of which marked periods of intense market distribution. This unusual on-chain behavior reflects heightened movement of long-dormant coins, suggesting that experienced holders may be taking profits at current levels. While this doesn’t confirm an immediate trend reversal, it reinforces the idea that Bitcoin’s current consolidation is a critical inflection point—one that could either lead to renewed upside or trigger a deeper correction if bulls fail to regain momentum soon. Long-Term Holders Begin Distributing, But Rally Still Intact Top analyst Axel Adler has shared insights highlighting a key shift in Bitcoin market behavior: the sharp rise in the Monthly CDD to Yearly CDD ratio indicates that long-term holders (LTHs) are beginning to actively move dormant coins back into circulation. Historically, such elevated CDD levels have marked periods of heightened activity from experienced investors, often signaling a distribution phase where profits are realized after prolonged holding. These spikes are significant because they suggest that coins held for years are now re-entering the market. According to Adler, this kind of activity isn’t random—it typically comes from holders with deep market knowledge who recognize potential turning points. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean the rally is over. While it may cap short-term upside and introduce volatility, current macro and institutional trends provide a solid counterbalance. Treasury demand remains strong, and Bitcoin ETF inflows are still flowing steadily, acting as a buffer against excessive downward pressure. This structural support is crucial in maintaining overall bullish momentum, even as some distribution unfolds. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Still Reluctant To Sell – Supply Active Data Shows Room For Upside Sideways Movement Persists Below $120K Resistance Bitcoin (BTC) continues to consolidate in a tight range, as shown in the 12-hour chart. Price action remains compressed between the $115,724 key support and the $122,077 resistance level. After a strong impulse earlier this month, momentum has clearly cooled, with BTC now oscillating within this horizontal channel for over 10 days. Notably, the price is currently hovering near $118,500—right around the 50-period moving average (blue), which has acted as dynamic support since early July. The 100-period (green) and 200-period (red) moving averages remain well below the current price, indicating that the broader trend remains bullish despite the pause in upward movement.

2025-07-24 20:00:47+00:00,"Bold Forecast: Bitcoin Headed For $1 Million In The Long-Term, Says Fundstrat’s Co-Founder","Bitcoin has become a major topic of the day among several prominent figures and businesses in the crypto and financial sectors. While continuously flagged digital gold, the crypto king is predicted by many popular figures to reach the $1 million price mark in the following years. A Bitcoin Million-Dollar Moment Imminent After a period of steady upward movement that led to a new all-time high of $122,000, Bitcoin appears to have slowed down, now hovering near $117,000. BTC may have slowed down, but veteran market strategist and co-founder of Fundstrat Capital, Tom Lee , has rekindled optimism in the cryptocurrency market with a daring forecast. Tom Lee offered his bold prediction for BTC in a recent interview with CoinDesk. In the interview shared by Trending Bitcoin on the X (formerly Twitter) platform, the chairman was seen predicting that BTC’s value could soar to the $1 million price mark. Even though this forecast is expected to occur in the long term, some still consider the price level a daring and overly optimistic target for the digital asset. However, the founder remains unmoved or unhinged by this skepticism, stating that he is an adamant fan of the crypto leader. Lee’s robust optimism toward Bitcoin is strengthened by the fact that the flagship asset is turning out to be the ultimate form of trust in the financial landscape. He also reiterated that Bitcoin is digital gold, reflecting its potential to match Gold, the current largest asset in the world. According to Lee, Bitcoin, easily being considered digital gold , is likely to attract a market value similar to Gold. Gold’s market cap is now valued at a whopping $23 trillion, putting it at the top of the financial hierarchy. With BTC matching the market cap of Gold, Lee is confident that the crypto asset’s price should be worth $1 million in the following years. Another key factor to drive BTC’s value remarkably higher is the future businesses that can be created on the network. Lee stated that many future businesses can be built on the leading network because of its stability. $1 Million Value For BTC After New Act Tatiana Koffman, a seasoned investor, author, and creator of the weekly newsletter MythOfMoney, has also predicted that Bitcoin might surge to the $1 million mark. In an interview with Schwab Network, Koffman expressed her strong belief in the asset hitting this level, while pointing to the Bitcoin Act. According to the seasoned investor, the United States government is expected to purchase BTC steadily into its reserves following the Act. Also, Koffman believes that this move is likely to be adopted by other countries and corporations to create their treasury assets. As a result of this significant nationwide adoption, the investor contends that BTC could be worth between $500,000 and $1 million in the long term. Speaking on the major drivers, Koffman has highlighted BTC’s limited supply. With only 21 million in circulation, she stated that the Bitcoin Act will allow the US government to buy about 200,000 BTC each year, thereby limiting supply and pushing prices higher.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-headed-for-1-million/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO,Bitcoin News|bitcoin|BITCOIN Act|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|coindesk|digital gold|Fundstrat Capital|gold|MythOfMoney|Schwab Network|Tatiana Koffman|Tom Lee|US government,BTC,"Bold Forecast: Bitcoin Headed For $1 Million In The Long-Term, Says Fundstrat’s Co-Founder.

The market cap remains at $2.37 trillion, with institutional validation through Genius Group’s 200 BTC acquisition, which targets a 10,000-BTC treasury, as Goldman Sachs and BNY launch tokenized money funds. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, institutional treasury developments, altseason implications, and smart money positioning to assess BTC’s 90-day trajectory amid a key inflection between continued dominance and altcoin rotation acceleration. Technical Consolidation: Historic High Pause Creates Decision Point Bitcoin’s current price of $118,688 reflects a minimal 0.06% daily movement, representing healthy consolidation after reaching a historic all-time high of $123,091 on July 14 . The $2,347 intraday range represents 2.0% of the current price, demonstrating controlled volatility typical of institutional accumulation phases. Source: TradingView RSI at a healthy 63.83 provides optimal reading with room for continued appreciation without overbought concerns, suggesting sustainable consolidation rather than trend exhaustion. This technical reset creates a foundation for the next major move while maintaining bullish structure above all EMAs. Source: TradingView MACD indicators exhibit a concerning divergence, with the line at -141.12 below zero, despite a positive histogram at 2,895.80 , creating mixed signals that require careful monitoring. The divergence suggests a potential momentum shift, while the histogram indicates building pressure for directional resolution. Altseason Looming: Dominance Shift Threatens BTC Leadership Bitcoin’s market dominance at 61.64% faces pressure from emerging altseason dynamics as institutional capital explores high-performance blockchain alternatives. Source: TradingView The dominance level near multi-year highs creates vulnerability to rotation as altcoins demonstrate superior performance metrics. Altseason Index holding above 44 indicators potential capital flow from Bitcoin toward altcoin alternatives offering higher growth potential. Source: Coinglass This rotation pattern has historically preceded a strong decline in BTC dominance as institutions diversify beyond Bitcoin-only strategies toward broader crypto exposure. Smart Money Accumulation: Institutions Drive Treasury Expansion Despite altseason uncertainty, institutional treasury adoption accelerates, with Genius Group boosting its holdings to 200 Bitcoin while targeting an ambitious 10,000-BTC treasury accumulation. This aggressive institutional strategy demonstrates a sophisticated long-term position that transcends market rotation concerns. The launch of tokenized money funds by Goldman Sachs and BNY represents the mainstream financial infrastructure’s embrace of cryptocurrency technology. Japanese AI companies are targeting 3,000 BTC treasury allocations, and UK firms raising $135 million for Bitcoin strategies demonstrate a global momentum in institutional adoption. Quantum Computing Threat: Long-term Security Concerns Emerge Emerging quantum computing developments pose a potential long-term security risk, with 7 million Bitcoin potentially vulnerable within a 3-year timeline . This technological threat creates underlying uncertainty for institutional adoption strategies requiring multi-decade security assurance. While the quantum threat remains distant, institutional treasury managers must consider technological evolution in their long-term allocation decisions. Security concerns could accelerate the development of quantum-resistant alternatives, potentially impacting Bitcoin’s institutional adoption. Market Dynamics: Ancient Wallet Activity and Institutional Flows The ancient Bitcoin wallet activation , after 14.5 years, involves moving 3,962 BTC worth $468 million, demonstrating long-term holder distribution patterns. These historic movements typically indicate cycle maturation rather than bearish sentiment among original adopters. The wallet’s cost basis of $0.37 per Bitcoin in January 2011 versus the current $118,688 price represents an extraordinary 32,000,000% appreciation, validating Bitcoin’s long-term store-of-value thesis for institutional adoption consideration.

2025-07-24 20:40:23+00:00,Donald Trump Fed: Bold Demand for Lower Interest Rates Unleashes Economic Debate,"BitcoinWorld Donald Trump Fed: Bold Demand for Lower Interest Rates Unleashes Economic Debate The intersection of politics and monetary policy often sends ripples through global markets, and for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, understanding these dynamics is paramount. When Donald Trump Fed interactions become public, especially regarding critical issues like interest rates, the implications can be profound, shaping everything from bond yields to Bitcoin’s volatility. Recently, a direct encounter between former President Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has ignited fresh debate, highlighting the persistent tension between political desires and central bank independence. This pivotal meeting at the Federal Reserve headquarters saw Trump express a clear preference for lower interest rates, a move that could significantly influence the economic landscape and, by extension, the crypto market. What Sparked Donald Trump’s Fed Visit and His Demands? In a move that underscored his characteristic directness, former U.S. President Donald Trump Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at the Federal Reserve headquarters with a clear message: he wants lower interest rates. This encounter, as reported by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, was more than just a courtesy call; it was a direct expression of presidential economic philosophy. Upon his arrival, Trump reportedly questioned the substantial $3.1 billion cost of renovating the Fed headquarters, to which Powell allegedly responded with a simple shake of his head. This exchange quickly escalated, with Trump remarking that he generally fires managers of projects that exceed their budgets, setting a confrontational tone for the subsequent discussion on monetary policy. This visit reignited discussions about the delicate balance between executive influence and the Fed’s mandated independence, a principle designed to shield monetary policy from short-term political pressures and ensure long-term economic stability. The Crucial Call for Lower Interest Rates: Why It Matters for Donald Trump Fed Policy President Trump’s demand for lower interest rates isn’t merely a casual suggestion; it represents a significant economic stance with far-reaching implications for the U.S. and global economies. Historically, lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, encouraging investment, spending, and economic growth. This can lead to increased job creation and a more vibrant economic environment. For instance, businesses might expand operations, consumers might take out more loans for homes or cars, and the government’s cost of servicing its national debt could decrease. However, they also carry risks, such as fueling inflation if the economy overheats, or creating asset bubbles as investors chase higher returns in a low-yield environment. For the cryptocurrency market, the implications are particularly interesting. Periods of lower interest rates and increased liquidity in the financial system have often coincided with increased investor appetite for riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies. When traditional safe-haven returns, like those from bonds or savings accounts, diminish, investors tend to seek higher yields elsewhere. This “search for yield” can drive capital into alternative assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Therefore, the future direction of Donald Trump Fed policy, especially concerning rates, becomes a key factor for crypto investors to watch. A consistent push for lower rates could potentially create a more favorable macroeconomic backdrop for digital assets, making alternative investments more appealing as the opportunity cost of holding cash increases. Navigating the Budget Battles: A Key Aspect of Donald Trump Fed Discussions Beyond the interest rate debate, the discussion surrounding the Federal Reserve’s $3.1 billion headquarters renovation cost added another layer of intrigue to the Donald Trump Fed meeting. Trump’s questioning of this expenditure and his subsequent comment about firing managers of over-budget projects highlight a broader theme of fiscal scrutiny that often characterizes his approach to governance. This perspective, while applied to building costs, reflects a mindset that could influence broader economic policy. For example, a focus on reducing government spending or ensuring efficiency in public projects could align with a desire for a more streamlined economy. It also serves as a reminder that even seemingly bureaucratic details can become points of political contention, reflecting a populist appeal to fiscal responsibility. The Fed’s operational budget, while separate from its monetary policy decisions, is still subject to public and political scrutiny. A $3.1 billion renovation project, especially for a public institution, can easily become a lightning rod for criticism, particularly from those advocating for tighter government spending.

2025-07-24 21:00:14+00:00,"Ripple Leads Billion-Dollar Tokenization Market As Issuance On XRP Ledger Explodes 2,260%","A massive change in power is taking place within the blockchain space, and Ripple’s XRP Ledger is quietly becoming the most powerful force in the tokenization race. In July alone, tokenized asset issuance on the XRP Ledger surged from $5 million in January to more than $118 million, representing a 2,260% increase. This explosive growth, confirmed by both on-chain data and recent commentary by crypto commentator Pumpius, shows that the era of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on the XRP Ledger is becoming reality. XRP Ledger Rising Quietly According to Pumpius, who shared data on the social media platform X, the recent surge is not just hype but a reflection of real institutional migration. Banks, fintech firms, and private companies are now quietly issuing tokenized bonds, real estate titles, and commodities directly on the XRP Ledger. Unlike blockchains such as Ethereum that often struggle with high gas fees or Solana, which has faced reliability issues, XRPL offers the kind of enterprise-grade performance needed to handle large volumes of tokenized assets. Particularly, Ripple’s XRPL can process up to 1,500 transactions per second and do so with extremely low fees. According to the data in the image below, Ripple’s RWA value started 2025 around $5 million, with the majority coming from OpenEden’s T-bills on the XRP Ledger. However, this value is now sitting around $118 million with many other tokens of real-world assets. The $118 million worth of RWAs now tokenized is only a glimpse of the potential . Some analysts have forecasted that up to $5 trillion worth of real-world assets will be tokenized by 2030. Even if just 1% of that amount flows through the XRP Ledger, XRP’s current price levels could become a mere baseline. In the words of Pumpius, this turns XRP’s price narrative from speculation into mathematics. The infrastructure, according to him, is already live and handling institutional load. As such, the “$5 to $1000 XRP” prediction isn’t just fantasy if the XRPL becomes the backbone of RWA settlements. RLUSD And The Role Of The XRP Ledger One of the important developments pushing XRPL into the spotlight is RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin , which has already attracted interest from major Wall Street custodians like BNY Mellon. Interestingly, Pumpius also mentioned an example of how the XRP Ledger is expanding its use cases into high-value data markets beyond traditional finance. This example is the integration of the DNA Protocol, a project bringing genomic identity and healthcare-related RWAs onto the blockchain. This initiative introduces a new dimension of use cases for the XRPL, one that intersects with the trillion-dollar healthcare and biotechnology sectors. Beyond these developments on the XRP Ledger, Spot XRP ETFs could hit the US market anytime soon . Their eventual launch is expected to do wonders for XRP and possibly send its price above double digits.

2025-07-24 21:19:01+00:00,Michael Saylor’s Strategy Boosts Bitcoin War Chest With $2B Raise – Bloomberg,"Strategy, the corporate entity behind the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury, has expanded its latest preferred stock offering to $2 billion, according to a report from Bloomberg on Thursday. The firm, helmed by executive chairman Michael Saylor, had initially planned to raise $500 million through the offering. The increase comes as investor interest continues to gain exposure to Bitcoin via traditional financial instruments. Strategy Cuts Price of New ‘Stretch’ Preferred Shares as Demand Surges Strategy’s new preferred stock, dubbed “Stretch” (STRC), was first introduced earlier this week , with the company announcing plans to issue 5 million shares at $100 each. The Series A Perpetual Stretch preferred shares are expected to carry an initial 9% dividend. BREAKING: Michael Saylor''s STRATEGY plans to raise $2B for Bitcoin purchases, upsizing from $500M. pic.twitter.com/E5q9UggoCq — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 24, 2025 The Bloomberg report, citing sources familiar with the matter, stated that the shares are now set to be priced at $90 each, slightly below face value. Pricing is expected to take place on Thursday afternoon in New York. Despite the discount, the offering has attracted strong attention, prompting the company to quadruple the size of the sale. The Stretch preferred shares rank senior to some of Strategy’s previous preferred stock classes, including Strike and Stride, but remain junior to the company’s Strife securities and its convertible bonds.

Strategy, the corporate entity behind the world’s largest Bitcoin treasury, has expanded its latest preferred stock offering to $2 billion, according to a report from Bloomberg on Thursday. The firm, helmed by executive chairman Michael Saylor, had initially planned to raise $500 million through the offering. The increase comes as investor interest continues to gain exposure to Bitcoin via traditional financial instruments. Strategy Cuts Price of New ‘Stretch’ Preferred Shares as Demand Surges Strategy’s new preferred stock, dubbed “Stretch” (STRC), was first introduced earlier this week , with the company announcing plans to issue 5 million shares at $100 each.

Pricing is expected to take place on Thursday afternoon in New York. Despite the discount, the offering has attracted strong attention, prompting the company to quadruple the size of the sale. The Stretch preferred shares rank senior to some of Strategy’s previous preferred stock classes, including Strike and Stride, but remain junior to the company’s Strife securities and its convertible bonds.

William Duplessie, John Woeltz, Land Bail in Shock Case According to the July 24 report , Judge Gregory Carro (who is also presiding over the case against supposed UnitedHealthcare assassin Luigi Mangione) granted both Duplessie and Woeltz bail as the case’s evidence review continues. A Manhattan judge has agreed to release on bail two men charged with torturing a man in a luxury SoHo townhouse to obtain his cryptocurrency. https://t.co/QtNfpzB2pz — ABC News (@ABC) July 23, 2025 Duplessie is expected to be confined to a home in Miami, while Woeltz is set to stay at an undetermined location in New York. The alleged crypto criminals , who were initially charged with coercion, assault, and kidnapping last month, will be expected to wear ankle monitors throughout their confinement. NYC Crypto Torture Plot Makes Headlines News of Duplessie and Woeltz’s bail release comes nearly two months after an unnamed 28-year-old victim flagged down a cop while barefoot in the streets of Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood and claimed he had been held captive for weeks. The duo is alleged to have held and abused the unidentified victim against his will, going as far as binding, shocking, cutting, and threatening the man with a gun in a bid to gain access to his Bitcoin at a luxury townhouse. Both defendants have pleaded not guilty to the charges, claiming that the unidentified victim was allowed to move freely and even partied during his alleged captivity. “Victims of abuse are not always going to act the way we expect them to,” prosecutor Sania Khan said in a recent hearing. Mayor Eric Adams’ name has also been drawn into the scandal, with two officers, both of whom are members of his private security detail, placed on modified duty after driving the victim from the airport to his captors’ home. “Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,” the mayor’s office said in a statement. “We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.” A trial date has yet to be set.

2025-07-24 21:40:24+00:00,Revolutionary Crypto Real Estate: Christie’s Embraces Digital Payments for Luxury Properties,"BitcoinWorld Revolutionary Crypto Real Estate: Christie’s Embraces Digital Payments for Luxury Properties Imagine a world where buying a multi-million dollar mansion is as straightforward as sending a digital payment. For years, the traditional real estate market has been defined by complex banking processes, international transfer hurdles, and slow transactions. However, a monumental shift is underway, spearheaded by an unlikely pioneer in the luxury market. Christie’s International Real Estate, a name synonymous with opulence and high-value assets, is making headlines by launching a dedicated cryptocurrency division. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it’s a profound step that promises to reshape the landscape of crypto real estate transactions, opening up unprecedented possibilities for buyers and sellers of elite properties worldwide. Christie’s Pioneering Move: The Dawn of Digital Luxury Real Estate Christie’s International Real Estate, one of the most prestigious luxury real estate brokerages in the U.S., has officially announced the launch of its specialized cryptocurrency division. This groundbreaking initiative, as reported by the New York Times, signifies a bold embrace of digital assets within the traditionally conservative luxury property sector. But what exactly does this mean for the future of high-value transactions? The newly formed division is not merely a symbolic gesture. It’s a fully staffed operation, comprising a dedicated team of legal experts, financial analysts, and seasoned cryptocurrency specialists. Their primary mission? To facilitate seamless real estate transactions for clients using digital currencies, effectively bypassing the conventional banking system. This move is a direct response to a growing demand observed over the past two years, during which Christie’s quietly evaluated several high-value transactions executed with cryptocurrencies. A standout example includes a staggering $65 million property in Beverly Hills, California, which was successfully transacted using cryptocurrency at the client’s explicit request. This real-world experience has clearly demonstrated the viability and potential of crypto real estate . Why Now? The Unstoppable Rise of Crypto in Real Estate The decision by Christie’s isn’t an isolated event; it reflects a broader trend of digital assets gaining legitimacy and utility across various industries. But why is the real estate sector, particularly the luxury segment, now turning its gaze towards cryptocurrencies? Several compelling factors contribute to this shift: Speed and Efficiency: Traditional real estate transactions can be notoriously slow, often taking weeks or even months to close due to banking delays, paperwork, and international transfer complexities. Cryptocurrency transactions, leveraging blockchain technology, can be settled in minutes, offering unparalleled speed. Global Accessibility: Cryptocurrencies transcend geographical borders and traditional financial systems. This opens up the luxury real estate market to a global pool of buyers who might otherwise face hurdles with currency conversions, international wire transfers, or capital controls. Reduced Fees: While not always the case, certain cryptocurrency transactions can offer lower transaction fees compared to hefty international bank transfer charges or traditional brokerage fees, depending on the specific setup. Transparency and Security: Blockchain’s immutable ledger provides a transparent and verifiable record of transactions, enhancing security and reducing the potential for fraud, a critical aspect in high-value deals. Privacy: While not entirely anonymous, cryptocurrency transactions can offer a degree of privacy compared to traditional banking systems, which appeals to high-net-worth individuals seeking discretion. This confluence of benefits makes the integration of crypto an attractive proposition for both buyers and sellers in the luxury crypto real estate market. How Does a Crypto Real Estate Transaction Work with Christie’s? For many, the idea of buying a house with Bitcoin or Ethereum might still seem futuristic or overly complicated. However, Christie’s new division aims to streamline this process, making it as seamless and secure as possible. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it might work: Client Consultation: A client expresses interest in purchasing a property using cryptocurrency. Expert Assessment: Christie’s dedicated team, including legal and crypto experts, assesses the client’s digital assets, ensuring their legitimacy and verifying the source of funds to comply with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. Valuation and Conversion (Optional but Common): While direct crypto-to-property exchanges are possible, many transactions currently involve converting the cryptocurrency into fiat currency (like USD) at an agreed-upon exchange rate at the time of the transaction. This mitigates volatility risks for the seller.

WazirX Has Revealed The Creditor Revote Timeline In a post on X, WazirX has shared an update on the situation regarding user crypto distribution. The exchange fell prey to an infamous hack one year ago, in which attackers linked with the North Korean Lazarus Group made away with almost $235 million in digital asset funds. The platform closed its deposits and withdrawals in response to the attack, and to this day, it hasn’t been able to resume operations. This means that the rest of the original $500 million in user funds, around $265 million, are still stuck in limbo. Recent developments, however, have finally set things in motion. In June, WazirX’s parent company, Zettai PTE LTD, a Singapore-based entity that was responsible for handling user crypto, went to the Singapore High Court with a distribution proposal that had overwhelming support from the creditors behind it. This plan, however, had ended up finding rejection. Earlier this month, the company again went to court with a revised proposal, and this time, the court ended up giving it a green light. Alongside the announcement of the court hearing decision, WazirX had said another creditor vote will need to happen before the proposal can move forward. Now, the exchange has formally announced a date for it: July 30th. This revote will remain live until August 6th. “If the requisite majority of creditors vote FOR the Scheme once again, the token distribution will start within 10 business days after the Scheme is effective, just as planned,” noted WazirX in the post. This means that for the first time in this saga, users finally have a potential timeline for distribution. Alongside the distribution process, the exchange also plans to restart operations. Nischal Shetty, CEO of WazirX, has also talked about the process in an X post . “A restart will also help us work towards generating profits and distributing it back to all creditors,” said Shetty. The court had previously rejected the plan due to concerns about compliance with Singapore’s Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) and the involvement of Panama-based Zensui in the distribution process. The greenlight came as Zanmai Labs, the Indian company behind the exchange, was instead tasked with handling the funds. It now remains to be seen whether creditors will vote in favor of the amended proposal, as they did for the last one, and potentially allow for an end to the long saga.

2025-07-24 22:00:26+00:00,XRP Price Showing Quiet Strength As Next Breakout Level Lies At $4.65,"XRP has entered a period of quiet movement following its rally last week that pushed its price to new all-time highs. Particularly, XRP’s price has hovered between $3.40 and $3.60 over the past few days. This structure has caught the attention of crypto analyst CasiTrades, who shared her detailed outlook on the social media platform X. Her accompanying chart breaks down the ongoing setup and shows the significance of the $3.40 support alongside the bullish implications of XRP’s behavior just beneath the resistance zone. Former Resistance Now Support CasiTrades points to a classic bullish flip taking place in XRP’s chart pattern on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe. A key trendline, which had previously served as overhead resistance, has now been flipped and is acting as support. This shift has played out with precision, as price has tested the trendline three times and each bounce affirms that buyers are stepping in with confidence. According to her analysis, this kind of structural transition might be subtle, but momentum is quietly building up for XRP’s next price move. Related Reading: ‘XRP Is The End Game’ — Pundit Reveals Why It’s Better Than Bitcoin The trendline, which has now flipped to support, sits just above the $3.40 level, and its resilience has helped XRP avoid any serious breakdowns since last week. As long as this line continues to hold, bulls will remain in control. To sum it up, the analysis shows that XRP is now in an accumulation phase rather than exhaustion, which is notable considering its significant rise earlier in the first half of July. Furthermore, a look at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows that there’s still room for momentum to push higher than $3.65 before the end of the month. However, the analyst also acknowledges that nothing is guaranteed. If the $3.40 support gives out, the XRP price could retrace to $3.20, where the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level lines up. Other Fibonacci price levels to watch for a rebound are at $2.96, $2.76, $2.56, $2.50, and $2.27. Next Target Lies At $4.65 The trendline’s consistency, combined with the RSI levels, makes a stronger case for a breakout than a breakdown. The road ahead could open up well if XRP can bounce well at $3.40 and finally punch through the $3.60 to $3.66 resistance range. CasiTrades identified $4.65 as the next major level to watch, a target derived from the 2.618 Fibonacci extension of the previous rally. In the meantime, a middle price level to watch is at $4.11 on the path to $4.65. “The volatility above here gets wild and fast,” the analyst said.

Related Reading: ‘XRP Is The End Game’ — Pundit Reveals Why It’s Better Than Bitcoin The trendline, which has now flipped to support, sits just above the $3.40 level, and its resilience has helped XRP avoid any serious breakdowns since last week. As long as this line continues to hold, bulls will remain in control. To sum it up, the analysis shows that XRP is now in an accumulation phase rather than exhaustion, which is notable considering its significant rise earlier in the first half of July. Furthermore, a look at the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the 1-hour candlestick timeframe chart shows that there’s still room for momentum to push higher than $3.65 before the end of the month. However, the analyst also acknowledges that nothing is guaranteed. If the $3.40 support gives out, the XRP price could retrace to $3.20, where the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level lines up. Other Fibonacci price levels to watch for a rebound are at $2.96, $2.76, $2.56, $2.50, and $2.27. Next Target Lies At $4.65 The trendline’s consistency, combined with the RSI levels, makes a stronger case for a breakout than a breakdown. The road ahead could open up well if XRP can bounce well at $3.40 and finally punch through the $3.60 to $3.66 resistance range. CasiTrades identified $4.65 as the next major level to watch, a target derived from the 2.618 Fibonacci extension of the previous rally. In the meantime, a middle price level to watch is at $4.11 on the path to $4.65. “The volatility above here gets wild and fast,” the analyst said.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Block chief executive Owen Jennings says that sellers using Square can now receive the top crypto asset by market cap as a form of payment. “Today we’re onboarding our first few Square sellers for the new native Bitcoin acceptance experience this is the way!” Block, which was founded by former Twitter executive Jack Dorsey in 2009, recently announced that it had been added to the S&P 500, causing its stock price to rally. The firm released a statement noting that this is just the beginning for them. Block first announced BTC payments were coming to its platform in May. At the time, the firm also said that paying with BTC would be as easy as “scanning a QR code at checkout” for customers. Miles Suter, Bitcoin product lead at Block, said that the addition of BTC would empower merchants. “Block has long been a champion of Bitcoin, focused on making it more accessible and usable in our everyday lives. Rolling out a native Bitcoin experience to millions of sellers brings us one step closer to that goal. When a coffee shop or retail store can accept Bitcoin through Square, small businesses get paid faster, and get to keep more of their revenue. This is about economic empowerment for merchants who like to have options when it comes to accepting payments.” XYZ is trading for $79.50 at time of writing, a fractional increase on the day.

2025-07-24 22:10:24+00:00,Intel’s Strategic Pullback: Streamlining Global Manufacturing for Future Growth,"BitcoinWorld Intel’s Strategic Pullback: Streamlining Global Manufacturing for Future Growth In the fast-paced world of technology and global commerce, even giants like Intel must adapt swiftly to shifting economic tides. Recent announcements from the semiconductor behemoth signal a significant strategic pivot, impacting its global Intel manufacturing footprint and setting a new course for efficiency. This move, spearheaded by CEO Lip-Bau Tan, is not just about cutting costs; it’s a bold re-evaluation of how a leading tech company navigates the complex demands of the modern semiconductor industry . Why is Intel Scaling Back its Global Manufacturing Footprint? Intel’s second-quarter earnings report revealed a decisive step towards shedding what CEO Tan refers to as ‘inefficiencies.’ This includes a significant re-evaluation of several ambitious manufacturing projects. Specifically, Intel has decided to delay, and in some cases, entirely halt, previously announced plans for new facilities. The company confirmed it is no longer proceeding with its projects in Germany and Poland. These projects, which included an assembly and testing facility in Poland and a major chip factory in Germany, had been in limbo since their suspension in 2024, shortly after their initial announcement. This strategic shift highlights a proactive approach to realigning production capacity with current and projected market demand. CEO Tan was candid about the reasons behind these difficult decisions during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. He stated, “Unfortunately, the capacity investment we make over the last several years were well ahead of demand and were unwise and excessive.” This acknowledgement underscores a critical lesson in capital expenditure management within a volatile industry. Intel’s new mantra is clear: “Our factory footprint has become needlessly fragmented. Going forward, we will grow our capacity based solely on the volume commitments and deploy capex lockstep with the tangible milestones, and not before.” This disciplined approach aims to prevent future overextension and ensure that investments are directly tied to verifiable demand. Optimizing the Global Supply Chain: A Strategic Consolidation Beyond halting new projects, Intel is also streamlining its existing operations to enhance its global supply chain efficiency. The company plans to consolidate its test operations in Costa Rica, redirecting these activities to its established sites in Vietnam and Malaysia. This consolidation is a move towards greater operational synergy, reducing fragmentation and potentially improving logistics and cost-effectiveness. By centralizing these critical testing functions, Intel aims to create a more robust and responsive supply chain, better equipped to handle the dynamic needs of the semiconductor market. This move is particularly pertinent in an era where supply chain resilience is paramount. Geopolitical shifts, trade tensions, and unforeseen global events can significantly disrupt the flow of goods and components. By consolidating operations, Intel is not just seeking cost savings; it’s building a more agile and less vulnerable manufacturing network. This strategic refinement of the global supply chain demonstrates Intel’s commitment to optimizing every aspect of its production, from raw materials to final product delivery. Driving Business Efficiency: CEO Tan’s Transformative Vision The changes in Intel’s manufacturing strategy are part of a broader, more ambitious plan led by CEO Tan to drive comprehensive business efficiency across the entire organization. Tan, who took the helm on March 12, wasted no time in articulating his vision: eliminate inefficiencies by divesting non-core units and streamlining core operations. His focus on creating a “clean and streamlined organization” is a testament to his commitment to revitalizing Intel’s operational health. During the Q2 earnings call, Tan reiterated his resolve: “We have much work to do in building a clean and streamlined organization, which we have started in earnest, and is remain an area of focus for me during Q3. Our goal is to reduce inefficiencies and redundancies and increase accountability at every level of the company.” This holistic approach to business efficiency extends beyond manufacturing, touching every facet of Intel’s corporate structure. Workforce Adjustments and Organizational Streamlining A significant component of this efficiency drive involves workforce adjustments. Intel has reduced its workforce by approximately 15% and plans to conclude the year with 75,000 employees. This reduction is a substantial shift from the 124,800 people employed at the end of 2023, and the 108,900 at the end of 2024 according to the company’s SEC filings. Furthermore, Tan highlighted that these layoffs enabled the elimination of 50% of management layers, a clear indicator of the company’s push for a flatter, more accountable organizational structure.

2025-07-24 23:00:16+00:00,"Crypto Liquidations Near $1 Billion As XRP, Dogecoin Crash 10%","The cryptocurrency derivatives market has suffered heavy liquidations as altcoins like XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have plummeted. Crypto Has Seen Almost $1 Billion In Liquidations During The Past Day According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency derivatives sector has been shaken up by a wave of liquidations in the last 24 hours. “Liquidation” here refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes when its losses exceed a certain percentage (as defined by the platform). Related Reading: When Will Ethereum Turn Overheated? Report Says Watch This Level Below is a table that breaks down the numbers related to the latest liquidations in the digital assets market: As displayed, the cryptocurrency sector has seen a whopping $967 million in derivatives contract liquidations over the past day. Out of these, an overwhelming majority of the positions involved were long ones. More specifically, users betting on a bullish outcome took a beating of around $829 million. These mass liquidations have come as assets across the market have witnessed some degree of bearish price action. The likes of XRP and Dogecoin are currently down about 10%. Interestingly, Bitcoin (BTC) hasn’t been affected by this latest sector-wide downturn, suggesting that the decline could be a result of investors rotating capital out of altcoins. Given BTC’s relatively flat action, it’s not surprising to see that the number one cryptocurrency hasn’t been leading in liquidations this time around. From the above heatmap, it’s visible that Ethereum (ETH) has topped the market with a derivatives flush of almost $200 million, while XRP has come second with liquidations of $115 million. Despite the fact that Bitcoin hasn’t actually moved much in the past day, users have still managed to rake up $84 million in liquidations. Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin wrap up the top 5 with figures sitting at $58 million and $56 million, respectively. The mass liquidation event from the past day may be a product of overheated conditions that had already been brewing in the sector. As on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed in its latest weekly report, the Open Interest across the top altcoins has seen a significant increase since the start of July. The “Open Interest” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of futures positions related to an asset that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. As shown in the chart, the metric’s combined value for Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin sat at $26 billion at the start of the month, but it has now grown to $44 billion.

Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord), a veteran investor active since 2011, had warned the day before that a major downturn was imminent. On the same day, XRP dropped from above $3.5 to a low of $2.99, while Bitcoin fell from over $120,000 to below $118,000. That decline caught many unprepared, especially given the strong bullish sentiment that had built around XRP following its recent climb to a new all-time high . Will the Market Shift Again? Now, Crypto Bitlord has followed up with another post, this time saying, “There’s about to be a big pump in crypto.” The reversal in tone from one of the space’s most seasoned voices has caught the attention of traders looking for direction.

2025-07-24 23:00:39+00:00,Trump’s WLFI Ethereum Bet Grows: Wallet Now Holds $281M In ETH,"Ethereum is undergoing a healthy correction following an explosive multi-week rally that saw its price surge by more than 80% since late June. After reaching new local highs, the market is cooling down, but sentiment remains strong as major players continue to accumulate. In a notable move, World Liberty Financial (WLFI)—a decentralized finance protocol and cryptocurrency company founded in 2024 and owned by US President Donald Trump—purchased an additional $2,010,000 worth of ETH just hours ago. This follows several consecutive days of wallet activity tied to WLFI, signaling continued confidence in Ethereum’s upside potential. The timing of this purchase is key. Ethereum appears to be entering a new expansion phase, supported by improved fundamentals, growing institutional interest, and strong DeFi momentum. While short-term volatility may persist, the ongoing accumulation from high-profile investors adds weight to speculation that Ethereum could resume its climb after this consolidation. Institutional Demand, Legal Clarity, and Macro Strength Fuel Ethereum Bullish Outlook Top analyst Ted Pillows reports that World Liberty Financial now holds $281,000,000 worth of Ethereum. This massive accumulation reflects a rising trend of institutional interest in ETH, which could continue to expand in the weeks ahead. Pillows suggests that as long as large entities like WLFI keep acquiring ETH, the asset’s long-term outlook remains structurally bullish. Beyond institutional demand, recent legislative breakthroughs in the US are providing fresh tailwinds for Ethereum. The approval of the GENIUS Act and the Clarity Act by the US Congress marks a turning point in the regulatory landscape. These bills aim to provide legal clarity and protections for decentralized finance and crypto protocols, potentially unlocking broader adoption and capital inflows into the space. Meanwhile, the macroeconomic backdrop has turned more favorable. Fears of recession and aggressive tightening have faded, while equity markets, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, are setting new all-time highs. This shift in sentiment is reducing risk aversion across the board, allowing crypto assets like Ethereum to benefit from renewed appetite among institutional and retail investors. ETH Price Analysis: Local Pullback After Sharp Rally Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $3,595 after a notable rejection from the $3,860 resistance zone, as shown in the 12-hour chart. ETH reached a local top just below $3,900 before entering a corrective phase. Despite the pullback, the broader trend remains bullish, with all key moving averages trending upward—50 SMA at $3,005, 100 SMA at $2,759, and 200 SMA at $2,469—well below the current price action. The $3,742 level, which acted as short-term support, has now turned into a pivot zone. Ethereum is attempting to consolidate between $3,750 and $3,500, with bulls needing to defend current levels to avoid a deeper retracement. If this zone fails to hold, the next strong support lies around $3,000, which marked previous resistance during the consolidation phase in May and June. Volume has declined slightly after the breakout, suggesting a temporary cooldown. However, as long as ETH stays above the $3,000 psychological and technical support, the uptrend remains intact. A break above $3,860 could trigger the next leg toward $4,000 and beyond, while a drop below $3,500 could lead to a retest of the $3,000–$3,200 demand zone.

2025-07-24 23:10:24+00:00,Bitcoin Cycle Theory: Why CryptoQuant CEO Says It’s Profoundly Obsolete Now,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Cycle Theory: Why CryptoQuant CEO Says It’s Profoundly Obsolete Now Are you still basing your Bitcoin investment decisions on the familiar ebb and flow of past cycles? If so, you might be missing a crucial paradigm shift. According to Ki Young Ju, the insightful CEO of leading on-chain analytics firm CryptoQuant, the traditional Bitcoin cycle theory as we knew it is no longer applicable. This isn’t just a minor adjustment; it’s a profound structural change that redefines how we understand Bitcoin’s market dynamics, driven primarily by an unprecedented wave of institutional adoption. What Was the Traditional Bitcoin Cycle Theory ? For years, the crypto community largely operated under a predictable framework. The traditional Bitcoin cycle theory often mirrored the halving events, suggesting a four-year pattern of market behavior. This theory was built on observable patterns of retail investor sentiment and the actions of large individual holders, often dubbed ‘whales’. Accumulation Phase: After a market downturn, ‘whales’ (large individual investors) would quietly accumulate Bitcoin at lower prices, often when retail interest was at its lowest. Mark-Up Phase: As Bitcoin’s price began to rise, often fueled by halving narratives and renewed interest, retail investors would gradually re-enter the market, driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Distribution Phase: At market peaks, whales would strategically sell their holdings, taking profits as retail investors enthusiastically bought in, believing the rally would continue indefinitely. Mark-Down Phase: The market would then enter a correction or bear market, leading to retail capitulation and the cycle repeating. This model, while imperfect, provided a useful lens for many to navigate Bitcoin’s volatile landscape. It emphasized the power of large individual holders to influence price and the emotional swings of the retail crowd. However, the game has fundamentally changed. The Profound Shift: Why Bitcoin Cycle Theory No Longer Applies Ki Young Ju’s recent declaration on X (formerly Twitter) marks a pivotal moment in how we perceive the market. He stated unequivocally that the traditional Bitcoin cycle theory —based on whale accumulation and retail exits—no longer holds true. Why the dramatic shift? Because the very players driving the market have changed. Ju points to a significant structural transformation: ‘old whales’ are now selling their Bitcoin, but not to the usual retail buyers. Instead, they are selling to ‘new long-term holders’, and these aren’t just other individual investors. These new holders are predominantly institutions. This suggests that institutional adoption of Bitcoin is far deeper and more pervasive than many previously imagined. Consider the stark contrast between the old and new market dynamics: Aspect Old Market Dynamics (Traditional Bitcoin Cycle Theory ) New Market Dynamics (Institutional Shift) Primary Buyers at Peaks Retail investors (FOMO-driven) Long-term institutional holders Primary Sellers at Peaks Individual ‘whales’ Old generation of ‘whales’ / Early adopters Market Drivers Retail sentiment, individual whale actions, halving narratives Institutional capital inflows, regulatory developments, long-term strategies Holding Horizon Often shorter-term (retail), mid-term (some whales) Significantly longer-term (institutions) Volatility Impact Higher due to emotional trading and rapid shifts Potentially lower due to stable, large-scale holding This shift implies a more mature market, one less susceptible to the emotional whims of individual traders and more influenced by the calculated, long-term strategies of financial giants. Who Are These New Institutional Players Driving Bitcoin Adoption? The term ‘institutional adoption’ isn’t just a buzzword; it represents a tangible influx of significant capital from established financial entities. These players are fundamentally different from the early individual investors who dominated Bitcoin’s formative years. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets like the U.S. have opened the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Ark Invest are now accumulating vast amounts of Bitcoin on behalf of their clients. Publicly Traded Corporations: Companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a corporate belief in its long-term value. Hedge Funds and Asset Managers: Increasingly, traditional hedge funds and asset management firms are allocating portions of their portfolios to digital assets, recognizing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class.

2025-07-24 23:30:00+00:00,Russia Reports x10 Rise In Registered Crypto Mining Firms,"A senior Moscow lawmaker says the number of Russian crypto mining firms signed up to the Federal Tax Service’s register has risen tenfold in the past six months. The Russian media outlet RBC reported that MPs claim that more than 1,000 firms are now “legally” mining coins. And this has led one political leader to claim that crypto is the “future” for many Russian businesses. Rise in Russian Crypto Mining Firms The head of the New People People Party, the lawmaker Alexey Nechaev, told attendees at a State Duma plenary session on July 23: “When crypto mining was emerging [in Russia], there were many who wanted to ban it. But it is clear now that the future belongs to cryptoassets. Mining will continue to develop.” The total Bitcoin hashrate over the past 12 months. (Source: Blockchain.com) He also confirmed that per FTS data, the number of “white” miners in Russia has increased 10 times since the start of the year. A new Russian law, introduced last year, stipulates that all crypto miners using more than 6,000 kWh of electricity per month must sign up to the register. Regulation Trumps Bans, MP Claims The FTS requires firms on its list to provide it with data on the number of coins they mine and the wallets where they hold their crypto. The tax body will also begin requiring firms on the list to pay taxes on their earnings. This could bring the Russian Treasury revenues of over $500 million per year, industry chiefs have claimed. Nechayev praised his fellow lawmakers for adopting the mining law in the fall of 2024. He said that MPs had acted with prudence by choosing to regulate, and not outlaw, mining. The lawmaker explained: “Driving people into the shadows with fines and bans is not an effective strategy.” Nechayev added that prior to the rollout of the new law, miners were forced to work in a grey, quasi-legal manner. The Russian lawmaker Alexey Nechaev. (Source: duma.gov.ru [CC BY 4.0]) Some miners, he noted, had tried to be transparent about their activities, but could not pay taxes as most of their businesses were not officially recognized. Nechayev said that this had previously led to “entire cities and districts” being left without electricity because miners overloaded power grids. Miners: Investing in AI Prior to the law, only 91 firms with crypto mining operations were able to register their businesses. This figure has now shot up to over 1,000, Nechayev said. Turkish Foreign Minister Fidan speaks after Russia and Ukraine peace talks https://t.co/f4gqZC5IJc — Reuters (@Reuters) July 23, 2025 The New People chief added that industrial miners are also investing in AI. He claimed that this year alone, crypto miners had spent 5 billion rubles ($63 million) on AI development. Nechaev claimed miners were now more likely to invest their money in Russia, rather than send it abroad. Furthermore, he concluded, many mining-related power outages have stopped. World’s Number 2 Bitcoin Miner? The Association of Industrial Miners, the doemstic mining sector’s biggest industry group, claims Russia is now consistently ranking second in the world in terms of Bitcoin (BTC) mining volume. Outputs are second only to those of the USA, the association says. And mining continues to develop, the body noted. This summer, Russian crypto mining firms say their hashrate exceeded 150 EH/s (exahash per second), accounting for 16.6% of the global hashrate. Domestic experts think up to BTC 40,000 (about $4.7 billion) was mined in Russia during the course of 2024. Earlier this month, a top Russian policymaker urged the state to start seizing crypto from illegal crypto miners . He said that a move to officially recongizing coins as a form of intangible property would help courts seize assets from illegal miners.

Earlier this month, a top Russian policymaker urged the state to start seizing crypto from illegal crypto miners . He said that a move to officially recongizing coins as a form of intangible property would help courts seize assets from illegal miners.

2025-07-24 23:30:51+00:00,XRP Projected Price if It Captures 20% of Global E-Commerce Transactions,"As XRP continues to gain attention in the cryptocurrency sector, some analysts believe the digital asset remains significantly undervalued , particularly in the context of global payment systems. One key area where XRP could see substantial adoption is within e-commerce, a sector prepared for continued growth through the rest of the decade. Evaluating XRP’s Role in E-Commerce Growth The global e-commerce payments market, valued at approximately $7 trillion in 2024, is expected to increase to $11.4 trillion by 2029, according to industry forecasts. This growth is driven by factors such as the expansion of mobile-first purchasing, increased adoption of digital wallets, and demand for faster, more efficient payment options. While traditional methods like credit and debit cards remain in widespread use, there is a clear shift toward more modern solutions. Digital assets, such as XRP, have been identified as strong contenders in this evolving landscape. In August 2024, Web3 Enabler, a Salesforce Web3 partner, emphasized XRP’s potential in cross-border and domestic e-commerce transactions. The cryptocurrency’s rapid settlement time and minimal transaction fees were cited as advantages that align with the needs of both merchants and consumers. To understand the potential price impact if XRP were to power a portion of global e-commerce activity, we explored a scenario where XRP handles 20% of the projected 2029 transaction volume, equivalent to approximately $2.28 trillion annually. Projected XRP Valuation Based on Utility Model To estimate the corresponding XRP valuation, two analytical approaches were considered. The first model evaluates XRP based on pure utility, where the token functions as a core transaction layer within the payments ecosystem, similar to how liquidity assets are used by financial institutions. Using the Velocity of Money formula , and assuming each XRP token circulates four times per year, the model indicates a required market capitalization of $570 billion to facilitate $2.28 trillion in annual transactions. With an assumed circulating supply of 60 billion tokens, this places XRP at $9.50. If token velocity is lower, say, each XRP token is used only twice annually, then more value must be assigned to each unit to support the same transaction volume. Under these conditions, the model projects a price of $19.00 per XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Speculative Value Projection Based on Market Sentiment A second model considers the impact of market speculation, where investor enthusiasm and forward-looking expectations drive valuation before actual utility is fully realized. This is consistent with how assets like Bitcoin gained early value largely on anticipated use rather than immediate adoption. By applying a 15x speculative multiplier to the $570 billion utility-based market cap, this approach arrives at a projected market capitalization of $8.55 trillion. Dividing this figure by the same 60 billion circulating XRP tokens results in a theoretical price of $142.50 per token. Although these models are hypothetical and depend on multiple assumptions, including transaction volume, token velocity, and investor sentiment, they highlight the substantial upside that could materialize if XRP secures a meaningful share of the e-commerce market. Whether driven by practical use or speculative investment, XRP’s future price may reflect a broader shift in how global payments are processed in the digital age.

2025-07-24 23:55:15+00:00,STRC Stock: Strategy’s Bold $2.5 Billion Offering Unveiled,"BitcoinWorld STRC Stock: Strategy’s Bold $2.5 Billion Offering Unveiled In a move that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency and traditional financial markets, Strategy, a prominent Bitcoin treasury firm, is poised to make a monumental capital raise. The company is set to secure an astonishing $2.5 billion through an expanded offering of its Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, widely recognized as STRC Stock . This significant development, initially reported by Bitcoin News on X citing a notice from Fidelity, marks a pivotal moment for the firm and potentially for the broader digital asset space. From an initial filing of 5 million shares, the offering has been upsized dramatically to 28,011,111 shares, priced at $90 per share. This isn’t just a routine financial maneuver; it’s a strategic declaration of intent, signaling profound confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory and Strategy’s role within it. For anyone tracking the confluence of institutional finance and cryptocurrency, understanding the implications of this colossal STRC Stock offering is paramount. What Exactly is STRC Stock? Unpacking the Preferred Share Offering Before diving into the strategic implications, it’s crucial to grasp the nature of STRC Stock . Unlike common stock, preferred stock offers a unique blend of features that appeal to a specific class of investors. Strategy’s Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock carries several distinctive characteristics: Preferred Dividends: Holders of preferred stock typically receive fixed dividend payments before common stockholders. In this case, it’s a ‘Variable Rate,’ meaning the dividend yield can fluctuate, often tied to a benchmark rate, offering some protection against inflation or rising interest rates. Perpetual Nature: ‘Perpetual’ implies that there is no maturity date for the stock. It remains outstanding indefinitely, providing a continuous stream of income to investors unless redeemed by the issuer. Seniority in Liquidation: In the event of liquidation, preferred stockholders have a higher claim on the company’s assets than common stockholders, offering a layer of security. Non-Voting Rights: Generally, preferred stock does not come with voting rights, allowing the issuing company’s common shareholders to maintain control. This type of offering is a common tool for companies seeking to raise substantial capital without diluting the voting power of existing common shareholders or incurring traditional debt obligations that might carry more restrictive covenants. For Strategy, the issuance of STRC Stock allows them to tap into a broader investor base, including institutions and individuals seeking steady income streams combined with exposure to a company deeply integrated with Bitcoin. Why Did Strategy Upsize This STRC Stock Offering So Dramatically? The decision to upsize the STRC Stock offering from 5 million to over 28 million shares is a clear indicator of overwhelming demand and Strategy’s ambitious growth plans. Several factors likely contributed to this significant expansion: Robust Investor Demand: The initial filing likely garnered far more interest than anticipated, signaling strong market appetite for instruments tied to Bitcoin exposure, especially from a reputable firm like Strategy. This suggests a growing institutional comfort with indirect Bitcoin investments. Capital for Bitcoin Accumulation: Strategy’s core business strategy revolves around accumulating Bitcoin. A larger capital raise means greater capacity to acquire more BTC, especially during periods of market volatility or price dips, allowing them to capitalize on opportunities. Strengthening the Balance Sheet: The influx of capital bolsters Strategy’s financial position, providing a stronger foundation for future operations, strategic initiatives, and potential market downturns. Strategic Positioning: By raising such a substantial amount, Strategy reinforces its position as a leading corporate holder of Bitcoin, potentially deterring competitors and solidifying its brand in the digital asset ecosystem. Favorable Market Conditions: Despite market fluctuations, the long-term bullish sentiment around Bitcoin, coupled with increasing institutional adoption, creates a fertile ground for such capital raises. Investors are looking for diversified ways to gain exposure to the digital asset. This upsize is not merely an adjustment; it’s a testament to the market’s confidence in Strategy’s vision and the enduring appeal of Bitcoin as a treasury asset. The sheer scale of the STRC Stock offering underscores the maturity of the crypto market and the increasing sophistication of financial instruments designed to bridge traditional finance with digital assets.

Framing the newly introduced GENIUS Act stablecoin legislation as “a seminal moment for digital assets and global dollar dominance,” Mallers said that while the bill “has nothing to do with Bitcoin directly,” it is indirectly significant because stablecoin expansion and Bitcoin appreciation are, in his view, intertwined.

2025-07-25 00:10:24+00:00,ProCap Financial Merger: A Monumental Step Towards Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Ambitions,"BitcoinWorld ProCap Financial Merger: A Monumental Step Towards Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Ambitions The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, marked by groundbreaking innovations and significant institutional moves. One such development capturing the attention of the financial world is the proposed ProCap Financial merger . This strategic alliance aims to bridge the burgeoning digital asset space with traditional finance, promising a future where Bitcoin plays an even more central role in mainstream investment portfolios. Let’s delve into the latest update that signals a major leap forward for this ambitious venture. What is the ProCap Financial Merger All About? At its core, the ProCap Financial merger represents a bold fusion of two distinct entities: ProCap BTC and Columbus Circle Capital Corp I (CCCM). ProCap BTC is a Bitcoin-native financial services firm, renowned for its focus on digital assets and founded by the influential crypto investor, Anthony Pompliano. On the other side, CCCM is a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a vehicle designed to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) with the purpose of acquiring an existing company. The goal of this business combination is to create a publicly traded entity, ProCap Financial, that will offer a comprehensive suite of financial services deeply rooted in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This move is particularly significant as it signals a growing trend of established financial structures embracing the decentralized world of cryptocurrency, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. Why is the Draft S-4 Filing a Critical Milestone for the ProCap Financial Merger? In a pivotal move, ProCap Financial has officially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-4 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing, announced via a July 24 press release on PR Newswire, is far more than just bureaucratic paperwork; it is a critical milestone in the journey toward finalizing the ProCap Financial merger . What is an S-4? Form S-4 is a registration statement required by the SEC for business combinations, such as mergers or acquisitions. It provides comprehensive information about the transaction, including financial details, business plans of the combined entity, and risks involved, to potential investors. Ensuring Transparency: The filing mandates full disclosure, ensuring that all relevant information about ProCap Financial, its operations, and its financial health is made public. This transparency is vital for investor confidence and regulatory oversight. Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will meticulously review the S-4 filing. This process ensures compliance with securities laws and protects investors from potential fraud. While the draft filing marks progress, the merger is still subject to SEC approval and other customary closing conditions. Paving the Way for Public Listing: Once approved, the S-4 allows the combined entity to issue new shares to complete the merger, effectively leading to ProCap Financial becoming a publicly traded company. This will open doors for a wider range of investors to gain exposure to a Bitcoin-centric financial services firm. Anthony Pompliano’s Bold Vision: A Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Ambition Central to the narrative of the ProCap Financial merger is the ambitious vision spearheaded by Anthony Pompliano. A well-known figure in the crypto space, Pompliano has consistently advocated for Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a foundational asset for the future financial system. His firm, ProCap BTC, was founded on these principles, aiming to build a financial services company specifically tailored for the Bitcoin economy.

BitcoinWorld ProCap Financial Merger: A Monumental Step Towards Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Ambitions The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, marked by groundbreaking innovations and significant institutional moves. One such development capturing the attention of the financial world is the proposed ProCap Financial merger . This strategic alliance aims to bridge the burgeoning digital asset space with traditional finance, promising a future where Bitcoin plays an even more central role in mainstream investment portfolios. Let’s delve into the latest update that signals a major leap forward for this ambitious venture. What is the ProCap Financial Merger All About? At its core, the ProCap Financial merger represents a bold fusion of two distinct entities: ProCap BTC and Columbus Circle Capital Corp I (CCCM). ProCap BTC is a Bitcoin-native financial services firm, renowned for its focus on digital assets and founded by the influential crypto investor, Anthony Pompliano. On the other side, CCCM is a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), a vehicle designed to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) with the purpose of acquiring an existing company. The goal of this business combination is to create a publicly traded entity, ProCap Financial, that will offer a comprehensive suite of financial services deeply rooted in the Bitcoin ecosystem. This move is particularly significant as it signals a growing trend of established financial structures embracing the decentralized world of cryptocurrency, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. Why is the Draft S-4 Filing a Critical Milestone for the ProCap Financial Merger? In a pivotal move, ProCap Financial has officially submitted a draft registration statement on Form S-4 to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing, announced via a July 24 press release on PR Newswire, is far more than just bureaucratic paperwork; it is a critical milestone in the journey toward finalizing the ProCap Financial merger . What is an S-4? Form S-4 is a registration statement required by the SEC for business combinations, such as mergers or acquisitions. It provides comprehensive information about the transaction, including financial details, business plans of the combined entity, and risks involved, to potential investors. Ensuring Transparency: The filing mandates full disclosure, ensuring that all relevant information about ProCap Financial, its operations, and its financial health is made public. This transparency is vital for investor confidence and regulatory oversight. Regulatory Scrutiny: The SEC will meticulously review the S-4 filing. This process ensures compliance with securities laws and protects investors from potential fraud. While the draft filing marks progress, the merger is still subject to SEC approval and other customary closing conditions. Paving the Way for Public Listing: Once approved, the S-4 allows the combined entity to issue new shares to complete the merger, effectively leading to ProCap Financial becoming a publicly traded company. This will open doors for a wider range of investors to gain exposure to a Bitcoin-centric financial services firm. Anthony Pompliano’s Bold Vision: A Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Ambition Central to the narrative of the ProCap Financial merger is the ambitious vision spearheaded by Anthony Pompliano. A well-known figure in the crypto space, Pompliano has consistently advocated for Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a foundational asset for the future financial system. His firm, ProCap BTC, was founded on these principles, aiming to build a financial services company specifically tailored for the Bitcoin economy. A particularly audacious goal previously disclosed by the firm is its aim to hold up to $1 billion in Bitcoin on its balance sheet. This commitment is not merely a statement; it’s a strategic decision that could have profound implications: Strong Signal to the Market: A billion-dollar Bitcoin holding by a publicly traded financial entity would send a powerful signal to traditional finance, validating Bitcoin as a legitimate, institutional-grade asset.

2025-07-25 00:25:21+00:00,Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Crucial Gauge for Market Sentiment,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Crucial Gauge for Market Sentiment Are you feeling the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely heard of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a fascinating barometer designed to measure the prevailing emotional state of investors. This crucial tool offers a unique lens through which to view market sentiment, moving beyond mere price charts to capture the underlying psychological currents that often drive market movements. As of July 25, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index registered at 70, maintaining its position within the ‘Greed’ zone, despite what some might perceive as weaker sentiment in recent days. But what does this really mean for you as an investor, and how can this index help you navigate the often-turbulent waters of the crypto world? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Really Measure? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by software development platform Alternative, is far more than just a number; it’s a comprehensive sentiment indicator. Ranging from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies “Extreme Fear” and 100 indicates “Extreme Greed,” this index aims to distill the complex emotional landscape of the crypto market into a single, easily digestible figure. Its core philosophy is rooted in the idea that excessive fear can drive down prices, creating buying opportunities, while irrational exuberance (greed) can lead to market bubbles, signaling potential corrections. Think of it as a temperature gauge for investor psychology. But how does it arrive at this number? The index doesn’t rely on a single data point. Instead, it aggregates data from six distinct market factors, each weighted to contribute to the final score: Volatility (25%): This factor measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them with average values over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates a fearful market, as investors react nervously to price swings. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This component assesses the current trading volume and market momentum, comparing them with average values. High buying volume in a positive market often indicates greedy behavior, while low volume or high selling volume might suggest fear. Social Media (15%): The index analyzes the sentiment and engagement around various cryptocurrency-related hashtags on platforms like Twitter. A surge in positive, hyped discussions can indicate growing greed, whereas negative sentiment suggests fear. Surveys (15%): Historically, this factor involved weekly polls where thousands of people were asked about their perception of the market. While currently paused, these surveys provided direct insights into investor sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric looks at Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate fear, as investors might be moving their funds from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, falling dominance can suggest greed, as funds flow into riskier altcoins in search of higher returns. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search queries for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “Bitcoin bubble,” the index gauges public interest and underlying emotional states. A surge in “bubble” related searches, for example, could signal growing fear. Each of these factors contributes to painting a holistic picture of the market’s emotional state, making the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a powerful tool for discerning underlying trends. Navigating the “Greed” Zone: What Does a Score of 70 Imply? A reading of 70 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index places the market firmly in the “Greed” zone. This doesn’t necessarily mean an immediate crash is imminent, but it does suggest that investors are feeling optimistic, perhaps even overly confident. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections, as asset prices become inflated beyond their fundamental value due to speculative buying. The adage, “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” often comes to mind here. The fact that the index fell slightly from 71 to 70 while remaining in ‘Greed’ suggests a minor softening of sentiment, but not a dramatic shift. It implies that while some of the froth might be coming off, the overall market mood remains buoyant. For astute investors, this ‘Greed’ signal serves as a prompt for caution. It encourages a review of portfolios, a potential de-risking strategy, or at least a heightened awareness of the potential for increased volatility. How Can Investors Strategically Use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just an interesting statistic; it’s an actionable tool for informed decision-making. Here’s how various types of investors can integrate it into their strategies: For Contrarian Investors: This index is a goldmine.

2025-07-25 00:30:34+00:00,Bitcoin Options: Crucial $12.3 Billion Expiration Looms on July 25th,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Options: Crucial $12.3 Billion Expiration Looms on July 25th Are you ready for a significant event that could send ripples across the cryptocurrency market? A colossal sum of nearly $12.3 billion worth of Bitcoin options is poised to expire on July 25th, at 08:00 UTC. This isn’t just another date on the calendar; it’s a moment that historically brings heightened volatility and intense scrutiny from traders and investors worldwide. Understanding what’s at stake, especially with such a massive volume of derivatives, is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic crypto landscape. Understanding Crypto Options: A Primer for the Uninitiated Before diving into the specifics of this upcoming expiration, let’s briefly clarify what crypto options are. In the simplest terms, an option is a financial derivative that gives the buyer the right , but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) at a predetermined price (the ‘strike price’) on or before a specific date (the ‘expiration date’). Call Options: Give the holder the right to buy the asset. Traders buy calls when they expect the price to rise. Put Options: Give the holder the right to sell the asset. Traders buy puts when they expect the price to fall. Options contracts are powerful tools for speculation, hedging, and income generation. However, their expiration can create significant market movements as large positions are settled, potentially leading to increased buying or selling pressure on the underlying asset. The Crucial July 25th Expiration: What’s at Stake for Bitcoin Options and Ethereum? The upcoming July 25th expiration is particularly noteworthy due to the sheer volume involved. According to data from leading crypto options exchange Deribit, we’re looking at staggering figures for both Bitcoin and Ethereum: Asset Value Expiring Put/Call Ratio Max Pain Price Bitcoin (BTC) ~$12.3 Billion 0.92 $112,000 Ethereum (ETH) ~$2.7 Billion 0.87 $2,800 These figures represent a significant portion of the open interest in the derivatives market, making the expiration a potential catalyst for price volatility. The sheer size of these expiring Bitcoin options contracts means that their settlement can lead to substantial shifts in supply and demand dynamics. Demystifying Max Pain Price for Bitcoin Options The term ‘max pain price’ might sound ominous, but it’s a critical concept in options trading. It refers to the strike price at which the largest number of outstanding options contracts (both puts and calls) will expire worthless, resulting in the maximum financial loss for options holders. In essence, it’s the price point where options sellers (who profit when options expire worthless) stand to gain the most. How it Works: As expiration approaches, options writers (often large institutions) might try to ‘push’ the underlying asset’s price towards the max pain point to maximize their profits. Market Influence: While not a guaranteed outcome, the max pain price can act as a magnet for the underlying asset’s price as expiration nears, especially for highly liquid assets like Bitcoin. For BTC: A max pain price of $112,000 suggests that a significant number of call options below this price and put options above it would expire worthless if BTC were to settle at that level. For ETH: Similarly, a max pain price of $2,800 indicates a similar dynamic for Ethereum options. Understanding the max pain price provides insight into where the market might gravitate, particularly as the clock ticks down to the expiration of these significant Bitcoin options and Ethereum options. Decoding the Put/Call Ratio: A Market Sentiment Indicator Another vital piece of information provided is the put/call ratio. This ratio is calculated by dividing the total open interest of put options by the total open interest of call options for a given asset. It’s a widely used indicator of market sentiment: Ratio below 1: Generally indicates a bullish sentiment, as there are more open call options than put options. Traders are betting on price increases. Ratio above 1: Generally indicates a bearish sentiment, as there are more open put options than call options. Traders are betting on price decreases. For BTC (0.92): A ratio of 0.92 suggests a slightly bullish or neutral sentiment among options traders for Bitcoin, leaning slightly towards calls. For ETH (0.87): A ratio of 0.87 indicates a more pronounced bullish sentiment for Ethereum compared to Bitcoin, with calls outnumbering puts more significantly. These ratios, combined with the max pain price, offer a more complete picture of the market’s collective expectations leading up to the expiration of these massive Bitcoin options contracts.

2025-07-25 00:40:23+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Plunge: Unraveling the Crucial Drop Below $118,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge: Unraveling the Crucial Drop Below $118,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz once again as the Bitcoin price takes a notable dip, falling below the significant $118,000 mark. This recent movement has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about market stability and future trends. According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $117,988.62 on the Binance USDT market. What exactly does this mean for the leading cryptocurrency, and what factors might be at play? Let’s dive deep into the dynamics shaping the current Bitcoin price action and what it could signify for the broader crypto landscape. What Triggered the Bitcoin Price Plunge Below $118,000? When the Bitcoin price experiences a sharp decline, it’s rarely due to a single isolated event. Instead, it’s often a confluence of various factors, both macroeconomic and crypto-specific, that create a ripple effect across the market. While the immediate trigger for this specific drop below $118,000 might be difficult to pinpoint definitively without more granular data, several common catalysts typically influence such movements: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, such as rising inflation concerns, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, can lead investors to de-risk. This often means pulling capital from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies and moving it into safer havens, directly impacting the Bitcoin price . Regulatory Scrutiny: News or rumors of increased regulatory crackdowns in major markets can spook investors. Uncertainty around new legislation concerning crypto exchanges, stablecoins, or digital asset taxation can trigger sell-offs. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence the market. A substantial sell-off by one or more whales can create downward pressure, especially in times of lower liquidity. Their moves are closely watched as indicators of market sentiment. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: For traders, key support levels are critical. If Bitcoin breaks below a widely recognized support level, it can trigger automatic sell orders and contribute to further price depreciation as momentum shifts to the downside. The $118,000 mark might have been one such psychological or technical support level. Market Sentiment and FUD: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) can spread rapidly through social media and news cycles, leading to panic selling. Conversely, positive news can fuel Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), driving prices up. Currently, the prevailing sentiment might be leaning towards caution. Understanding these underlying currents is essential for comprehending why the Bitcoin price behaves the way it does, even in seemingly sudden drops. Understanding Market Dynamics: Why Does Bitcoin Price React So Sharply? The cryptocurrency market, and especially the Bitcoin price , is renowned for its volatility. This isn’t just a random characteristic; it’s deeply rooted in the fundamental dynamics of a relatively young and still-evolving asset class. Unlike traditional financial markets with centuries of history and established regulatory frameworks, crypto markets operate with unique characteristics: Lower Liquidity Compared to Traditional Assets: While Bitcoin’s market capitalization is vast, its daily trading volume, especially in specific trading pairs, can be lower than that of major stocks or commodities. This means that large buy or sell orders can have a disproportionately larger impact on the Bitcoin price . 24/7 Global Trading: Unlike stock markets that close, crypto markets operate around the clock, across all time zones. This continuous trading can amplify price movements as reactions to news or events can occur instantly, without a closing bell to pause and reflect. Retail Investor Influence: A significant portion of crypto trading activity comes from retail investors. These individuals can be more susceptible to emotional trading (panic selling or FOMO buying), which can exacerbate price swings. Derivative Markets and Leverage: The existence of highly leveraged derivative products (futures, options) allows traders to amplify their gains, but also their losses. A sharp move in the spot Bitcoin price can trigger liquidations in derivative markets, creating a cascade effect that pushes prices further down (or up). Narrative-Driven Market: Crypto markets are often driven by narratives – whether it’s the narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold, the future of finance, or a hedge against inflation. Shifts in these narratives, or challenges to them, can profoundly affect investor confidence and the Bitcoin price . These dynamics create a fast-paced environment where information, sentiment, and trading activity intertwine to produce the dramatic price fluctuations we often observe.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge: Unraveling the Crucial Drop Below $118,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz once again as the Bitcoin price takes a notable dip, falling below the significant $118,000 mark. This recent movement has caught the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about market stability and future trends. According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $117,988.62 on the Binance USDT market. What exactly does this mean for the leading cryptocurrency, and what factors might be at play? Let’s dive deep into the dynamics shaping the current Bitcoin price action and what it could signify for the broader crypto landscape. What Triggered the Bitcoin Price Plunge Below $118,000? When the Bitcoin price experiences a sharp decline, it’s rarely due to a single isolated event. Instead, it’s often a confluence of various factors, both macroeconomic and crypto-specific, that create a ripple effect across the market. While the immediate trigger for this specific drop below $118,000 might be difficult to pinpoint definitively without more granular data, several common catalysts typically influence such movements: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, such as rising inflation concerns, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, can lead investors to de-risk. This often means pulling capital from volatile assets like cryptocurrencies and moving it into safer havens, directly impacting the Bitcoin price . Regulatory Scrutiny: News or rumors of increased regulatory crackdowns in major markets can spook investors. Uncertainty around new legislation concerning crypto exchanges, stablecoins, or digital asset taxation can trigger sell-offs. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence the market. A substantial sell-off by one or more whales can create downward pressure, especially in times of lower liquidity. Their moves are closely watched as indicators of market sentiment. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: For traders, key support levels are critical. If Bitcoin breaks below a widely recognized support level, it can trigger automatic sell orders and contribute to further price depreciation as momentum shifts to the downside. The $118,000 mark might have been one such psychological or technical support level. Market Sentiment and FUD: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) can spread rapidly through social media and news cycles, leading to panic selling. Conversely, positive news can fuel Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), driving prices up. Currently, the prevailing sentiment might be leaning towards caution.

2025-07-25 00:42:11+00:00,Why did Trump reveal his $2B BTC stash after changing US crypto laws?,"Trump Media and Technology Group announced that it had acquired $2 billion worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities on July 21, 2025. This was just three days after President Trump signed the GENIUS Act. The fact that this massive Bitcoin investment was kept hidden until after the law passed appeared to be part of a larger plan rather than a coincidence to critics. The question on their minds is: Did Trump use his presidential power to change the rules in favor of crypto, only to reveal afterward that he had a massive personal stake in it? In other words, did he write the playbook and then make the first move once the game was rigged in his favor? This question runs deep because the line between serving the country and personal interests gets blurred. It becomes especially concerning when a sitting president owns over half of a company that suddenly announces billions in crypto investments right after new laws are passed. It’s now less about one company or one law and more about how power, money, and policy seem to move together in ways that leave regular people wondering if the system is fair. The Genius Act aims to make Bitcoin safer for investors President Donald Trump handed both investors and crypto companies a powerful signal that the federal government now officially supports the growth of digital assets. He did so when he signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18, 2025 . It requires companies that want to issue payment stablecoins to hold 100% reserves in cash or short-term Treasuries. This means a real, safe, and liquid asset must back every digital dollar they create. Large Stablecoin issuers must also give regulators and the public insights into whether these companies operate safely and honestly. They must publish monthly public disclosures about their reserves and submit them to independent annual audits. Furthermore, the new law prioritizes customer protection by banning misleading marketing. This includes claims that stablecoins are backed by the US government, federally insured, or legally recognized as currency. And users will be paid back first, ahead of any other creditors, if a company becomes insolvent. But most importantly, the law prevents federal government officials, including the president, from issuing or promoting stablecoins while holding public office. The US government effectively signaled that it is ready to treat crypto as a permanent part of its financial future by officially welcoming one major digital asset into the regulatory fold. The infrastructure built under this act could soon provide legal clarity, financial bridges, and regulatory credibility to support other digital currencies, including Bitcoin. Trump’s Bitcoin stash appears after laws change President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18, 2025. Just three days later, on July 21, his privately linked company that owns the social media platform Truth Social made a major announcement. Trump Media and Technology Group revealed it had purchased approximately $2 billion worth of Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related financial products. This tightly packed timeline has drawn intense public scrutiny. It raises questions about Trump’s intentions and the possible use of public power to protect and grow his private wealth. Observers suspect the events were strategically planned to work together. The company had hinted as early as May that it was exploring a crypto treasury strategy and raising capital for future investments in digital assets. But until after the legal and political environment had shifted in its favor, it never disclosed the actual purchase of Bitcoin, nor did it reveal the size of its crypto plans. Critics suspect the president rewrote the game’s rules and then used that new structure to justify and reveal a high-stakes financial move that directly benefits him. They believe this because the company intentionally withheld the news. This new Bitcoin purchase immediately increased the value of a company that Trump personally controls and profits from because he holds a 53% ownership stake in Trump Media. His move raises serious ethical questions about the role of the presidency in shaping financial markets. This is especially concerning when the person writing the policy stands to benefit financially from the outcome. New rules help Trump grow his wealth Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, help run World Liberty Financial , another Trump-linked crypto firm. The company has launched its stablecoin, formed global partnerships, and attracted hundreds of millions in foreign investment. Reports show the firm deals with foreign governments, blockchain billionaires, and companies with past legal troubles. This includes Binance, whose founder CZ pleaded guilty to money laundering in 2023 but remains closely tied to Trump-linked crypto ventures.

2025-07-25 00:55:30+00:00,Urgent Update: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 37 – What It Means for Your Portfolio,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Update: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 37 – What It Means for Your Portfolio Are you keeping a close eye on the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, you’ve likely heard whispers, or perhaps even shouts, about the ever-shifting dynamics between Bitcoin and the myriad of altcoins. A crucial barometer for these shifts is the Altcoin Season Index , and its latest reading has some significant implications for every crypto investor. As of July 25, 00:33 UTC, the Altcoin Season Index , a metric diligently tracked by cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered a score of 37. This figure represents a notable drop of four points from the previous day’s report by Bitcoin World, firmly indicating that the market is currently entrenched in ‘Bitcoin Season’. But what exactly does this mean for your digital assets, and how should you adapt your strategy? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does 37 Signify? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a sophisticated gauge designed to provide clarity on the prevailing market sentiment. It helps investors understand whether Bitcoin or altcoins are leading the charge. Here’s a breakdown of how this vital index works: Exclusions: The index specifically excludes stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) to provide a cleaner look at genuine market performance. Scope: It compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. This broad scope ensures a comprehensive view of the market’s leading assets. Timeframe: The comparison is made over a 90-day period, offering a mid-term perspective rather than daily fluctuations. This longer window helps smooth out short-term volatility and reveals more significant trends. Defining Seasons: Altcoin Season: For the market to be in ‘Altcoin Season’, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This is when altcoins generally see significant gains relative to BTC. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. This signals a period where Bitcoin is either consolidating its dominance or seeing stronger growth compared to most altcoins. Score Range: The index scores range from 1 to 100, with higher numbers indicating a stronger lean towards Altcoin Season and lower numbers pointing to Bitcoin dominance. A score of 37 clearly places us in Bitcoin Season territory. Why Does Being in Bitcoin Season Matter for Your Investments? When the Altcoin Season Index dips into Bitcoin Season territory, it has profound implications for how investors should approach their portfolios. Historically, Bitcoin often acts as the market’s reserve asset, a safe haven, or the primary driver of liquidity. Here’s why this shift is crucial: Capital Flow: During Bitcoin Season, capital tends to flow from altcoins back into Bitcoin. This can lead to altcoins either stagnating, consolidating, or even depreciating against BTC. Risk Management: Altcoins are generally more volatile than Bitcoin. In a Bitcoin Season, their higher risk profile becomes more pronounced, as they may experience sharper declines or slower recoveries. Dominance Shift: Bitcoin’s market dominance typically increases during these periods. This means a larger percentage of the total crypto market capitalization is held by Bitcoin. Investor Sentiment: A strong Bitcoin performance often instills confidence in the broader market, but it might mean a more cautious approach to altcoin investments. It’s not just about price; it’s about the underlying market dynamics and investor behavior. Understanding these patterns is key to making informed decisions. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season : Strategies for Success So, with the Altcoin Season Index signaling Bitcoin’s dominance, what actionable steps can you take to protect and potentially grow your portfolio? Here are some strategies: 1. Re-evaluate Your Portfolio Allocation Consider increasing your Bitcoin exposure. If your portfolio is heavily weighted towards altcoins, this might be a good time to rebalance. A higher allocation to Bitcoin can provide more stability during periods of its dominance. This doesn’t mean abandoning altcoins entirely, but rather adjusting your risk exposure. 2. Focus on Strong Fundamentals During Bitcoin Season, weaker altcoins with less utility or smaller communities tend to suffer more. Focus on projects with robust fundamentals, active development, strong use cases, and a dedicated community. These projects are more likely to weather market downturns and potentially recover faster when sentiment shifts. 3. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) If you’re looking to accumulate more altcoins, a dollar-cost averaging strategy can be highly effective. Instead of making a large lump-sum investment, invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of the price. This reduces the risk associated with market timin",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-plunges-4/,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,Crypto News|Altcoin|BITCOIN|COINMARKETCAP|Crypto Market|Investment,BTC,"Urgent Update: Altcoin Season Index Plunges to 37 – What It Means for Your Portfolio.

2025-07-25 01:00:24+00:00,Market Top or Just a Pause? Analysts Weigh in on Bitcoin’s Quiet Zone,"Bitcoin continues to consolidate just below the $120,000 mark, exhibiting restrained momentum despite previous rallies that pushed it to all-time highs above $123,000. Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has fluctuated between a low of $117,422 and a high of $119,197, ultimately trading at $118,578 at the time of writing. While price movement has remained relatively stable, on-chain indicators suggest that broader market sentiment is still in a transitional phase, with neither excessive enthusiasm nor panic selling present among investors. Related Reading: Are Traders Walking Into a Bitcoin Bull Trap at $118K? Here’s What the Data Shows Bitcoin Market Signals Suggest Ongoing Expansion Phase A recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Gaah highlights a key development in the Index Bitcoin Cycle Indicators (IBCI), a composite tool used to track phases in Bitcoin’s market cycle. According to Gaah, the IBCI has returned to the “Distribution” zone, an area historically associated with the late stages of a bull market. However, this return is moderate, as the index has reached only 80% of the zone’s upper boundary, falling short of the full saturation levels typically observed at major market peaks. The IBCI’s moderate level indicates that Bitcoin is in an expansionary stage, but without the typical signs of overheating. Gaah noted that two critical components of the IBCI, the Puell Multiple and the Short-Term Holder Spent Output Profit Ratio (STH-SOPR), remain below their midpoint levels. This suggests that short-term speculation and aggressive profit-taking, often seen in late-stage bull markets, have not yet fully emerged in the current cycle. As a result, while caution may be warranted, the broader trend does not yet resemble a typical market top. The Puell Multiple, in particular, continues to hover near the “Discount” range, indicating that miner profitability remains moderate even with Bitcoin’s recent all-time high. This points to a valuation structure where network participants have not yet entered the excess phase that typically precedes a market correction. Gaah emphasized that the current state of the IBCI reflects underlying market strength supported by fundamentals, not speculative fervor. However, he also warned that the market is in a high-risk correction zone in the short term and should be monitored closely for shifts in retail behavior and miner activity. Short-Term Holders Offer Support Around Realized Price Adding to the discussion, another CryptoQuant analyst, Amr Taha, observed that Bitcoin has maintained price stability near the realized price of the UTXO Age Band for 1-day to 1-week holders, currently around $118,300. This metric is often interpreted as a dynamic support level that reflects the average cost basis for recent buyers. According to Taha, the absence of capitulation among newer holders implies that recent market entrants remain confident, reinforcing the current price range as a psychological and technical support zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hovers Below $120K as On-Chain Indicators Point to Slowing Demand Together, these insights suggest that while Bitcoin may face near-term volatility, broader indicators do not yet reflect an overheated market.

Instead, current metrics imply a market that continues to expand at a measured pace, with room for potential upside if fundamentals remain intact.

2025-07-25 01:00:24+00:00,"Crypto Sector Lost $3.1 Billion to Hacks in Q1 2025, Says Hacken Report","The cryptocurrency industry has witnessed over $3.1 billion in losses during the first half of 2025, already surpassing the total for all of 2024. According to a report published by blockchain security firm Hacken, the figure reflects persistent systemic vulnerabilities across both decentralized and centralized finance platforms, driven by outdated codebases, access-control flaws , and the growing complexity introduced by artificial intelligence integrations. Access-control exploits remain the leading cause of financial damage, contributing roughly 59% of the total losses, while smart-contract bugs accounted for around $273 million. Although the $1.5 billion Bybit incident in February stands out as a major event, it does not obscure the fact that the industry continues to face broad security shortcomings . Hacken’s forensic team observed a recurring theme in 2025: human and procedural errors are now a more frequent point of attack than cryptographic weaknesses. Legacy Infrastructure and Operational Vulnerabilities Hacken’s head of forensics, Yehor Rudytsia, noted that older codebases have remained active targets for attackers, with the GMX v1 platform being a key example. The protocol’s outdated structure began facing exploitation in Q3 2025. “Projects have to care about their old or legacy codebase if it was not stopped from operating completely,” Rudytsia said, emphasizing the risks of leaving older protocols exposed. Operational vulnerabilities have also played a prominent role, accounting for approximately $1.83 billion in losses across both DeFi and CeFi. The most notable case was the $223 million breach on Cetus, a DeFi platform, during Q2. The exploit was traced to an overflow check vulnerability in its liquidity calculations. Using a flash loan, the attacker opened hundreds of small positions across 264 pools. Hacken analysts suggested that real-time TVL monitoring with automatic pause mechanisms might have prevented up to 90% of the funds from being drained. AI and Insecure APIs Add Complexity to Web3 Security The incorporation of artificial intelligence tools into Web3 projects has added another layer of complexity to the security environment. According to Hacken’s report, there has been a 1,025% increase in AI-related attacks compared to 2023. Nearly 99% of these incidents involved insecure APIs, making them one of the most exploited attack surfaces today. As of mid-2025, 34% of Web3 projects are using AI agents in live environments, increasing their exposure to risks such as model hallucination, prompt injection, and data poisoning. Hacken also highlighted that existing security standards like ISO/IEC 27001 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework are not yet adequately equipped to handle these AI-specific threats. The report called for updated governance and risk models that can better account for evolving vulnerabilities in smart systems. With more sophisticated threat vectors emerging and attackers increasingly relying on automation and social engineering, the demand for proactive and adaptive security mechanisms in the crypto sector has grown substantially.

2025-07-25 02:34:18+00:00,BlackRock’s Ether ETF Joins Elite Ranks as One of Fastest-Growing Funds,"BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) has rapidly become one of the world’s fastest-growing exchange-traded funds, hitting the $10 billion mark in assets under management (AUM) in just 251 days. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared the news on Thursday, describing ETHA’s meteoric rise as the “equivalent of a God candle,” referring to the speed and magnitude of the inflow. ETHA now sits among the top three fastest-growing ETFs ever, a distinction it shares exclusively with other spot cryptocurrency funds. Crypto ETFs Dominate Speed Rankings The achievement puts ETHA ahead of many traditional ETFs, including JPMorgan’s Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ), which needed 444 days to reach $10 billion. Balchunas’ data shows that ETHA’s success underscores the growing appetite for crypto-backed financial products. The Ethereum-based ETF now trails only BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) in the race to $10 billion in AUM. These three are the only ETFs to reach that benchmark faster than any other in history. Industry Leaders Applaud Rapid Growth Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, pointed out the broader implications of this milestone. “We’re talking about an ETF industry that’s been around for over 3 decades and has nearly 4,400 products,” Geraci commented on X. He noted that the top three fastest-growing ETFs are now all crypto-focused, something previously unimaginable in traditional finance circles. Bitcoin ETFs Still in the Lead Despite ETHA’s impressive pace, it still lags behind BlackRock’s IBIT, which reached the $10 billion mark in just 34 days following its launch in January 2024. Fidelity’s FBTC was close behind, hitting the same milestone in just 54 days. These two products set a blistering pace for ETHA to follow, highlighting the enormous interest in crypto ETFs since regulators opened the door to spot crypto-based funds. Ether Inflows Surge as Bitcoin ETFs Cool Off Investor sentiment appears to be shifting toward Ether in recent weeks. According to SoSoValue, U.S.-listed Ether ETFs have recorded a 14-day inflow streak totaling $4.4 billion since July 3. This surge includes a massive $726.7 million daily inflow, the largest single-day amount since the ETF’s launch last year. Conversely, Bitcoin ETFs have shown signs of weakness. After enjoying a 12-day inflow streak, they turned negative on July 21. Over the next three trading days, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of $289 million, based on SoSoValue’s data. BlackRock Cementing Its Position in Crypto ETFs BlackRock’s dominance in the ETF landscape, both in traditional and digital assets, continues to grow. The firm’s success with both ETHA and IBIT reflects rising investor interest in regulated crypto exposure through mainstream investment vehicles.

2025-07-25 02:45:23+00:00,Upbit SYRUP Listing: A Pivotal Moment for Traders on July 25,"BitcoinWorld Upbit SYRUP Listing: A Pivotal Moment for Traders on July 25 The South Korean crypto market is abuzz with thrilling news that could reshape many trading strategies! Leading digital asset exchange Upbit has officially announced the highly anticipated Upbit SYRUP listing , set to go live with multiple spot trading pairs on July 25th at 06:00 UTC . This development marks a significant moment for the SYRUP project and opens new, exciting avenues for traders looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on fresh market opportunities. What is SYRUP and Why Does This Upbit SYRUP Listing Matter So Much? While the official announcement from Upbit primarily focuses on the listing details, understanding what SYRUP might represent helps us grasp the significance of this move. Typically, tokens like SYRUP are integral to specific blockchain ecosystems, serving various functions such as governance, utility within a decentralized application (dApp), or as a medium of exchange for services. Without specific details from the SYRUP project itself, we can generally anticipate it plays a crucial role in its native ecosystem. The importance of an Upbit SYRUP listing cannot be overstated. Upbit is one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea, a nation with a highly active and sophisticated crypto trading community. A listing on such a prominent platform brings several key benefits: Enhanced Liquidity: Greater trading volume ensures easier buying and selling without significant price slippage. Increased Visibility and Exposure: Millions of Upbit users will now have direct access to SYRUP, vastly expanding its potential investor base. Improved Credibility: Listings on major exchanges often serve as a stamp of approval, signaling a project’s legitimacy and adherence to certain standards. Potential Price Discovery: New listings frequently experience high volatility, offering both significant opportunities and risks for traders. This listing could propel SYRUP into the mainstream, attracting both retail and institutional interest from one of the world’s most dynamic crypto markets. Diving into the Trading Pairs: SYRUP/KRW, SYRUP/BTC, and SYRUP/USDT Upbit’s decision to list SYRUP against three distinct base currencies provides flexibility and caters to a broad spectrum of traders. Let’s break down what each pair signifies: SYRUP/KRW (Korean Won): This is arguably the most significant pair for the South Korean market. Trading against the Korean Won allows local investors to directly buy and sell SYRUP using their national fiat currency. This direct access simplifies the trading process for a large user base and often sees the highest trading volumes on Korean exchanges. SYRUP/BTC (Bitcoin): The SYRUP/BTC pair caters to crypto-native traders who prefer to manage their portfolios within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Bitcoin remains the benchmark cryptocurrency, and trading against BTC allows for easy comparison of SYRUP’s performance relative to the broader crypto market. It also facilitates arbitrage opportunities for traders moving assets between exchanges. SYRUP/USDT (Tether): USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. The SYRUP/USDT pair offers stability and a familiar reference point for international traders and those who prefer to lock in profits or mitigate volatility without converting back to fiat. It’s a popular choice for traders seeking liquidity and a direct dollar-equivalent value. The availability of these diverse pairs ensures that traders, regardless of their preferred base currency or trading style, can participate in the Upbit SYRUP listing with ease. What Opportunities Does the Upbit SYRUP Listing Present for Savvy Traders? For many traders, a new listing on a major exchange like Upbit is synonymous with opportunity. Here’s why the Upbit SYRUP listing could be a game-changer: Early Price Discovery: New listings often experience significant price movements in their initial hours or days as the market discovers the token’s fair value. This volatility can be highly profitable for those who make accurate predictions and execute timely trades. Increased Arbitrage Potential: With SYRUP available on Upbit, and potentially other exchanges in the future, price discrepancies between platforms could arise, creating arbitrage opportunities for quick-thinking traders. Portfolio Diversification: Adding a new asset like SYRUP, especially one with a strong use case or community, can help diversify a crypto portfolio, spreading risk and potentially capturing growth from emerging sectors. Access to a Growing Ecosystem: If SYRUP is part of a burgeoning blockchain project, investing in the token provides a way to participate in the growth and development of that ecosystem. However, it is crucial to remember that with high potential rewards come high risks. The early stages of a new listing are often characterized by extreme volatility.

Bitcoin remains the benchmark cryptocurrency, and trading against BTC allows for easy comparison of SYRUP’s performance relative to the broader crypto market. It also facilitates arbitrage opportunities for traders moving assets between exchanges. SYRUP/USDT (Tether): USDT is the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, pegged 1:1 to the US Dollar. The SYRUP/USDT pair offers stability and a familiar reference point for international traders and those who prefer to lock in profits or mitigate volatility without converting back to fiat. It’s a popular choice for traders seeking liquidity and a direct dollar-equivalent value. The availability of these diverse pairs ensures that traders, regardless of their preferred base currency or trading style, can participate in the Upbit SYRUP listing with ease. What Opportunities Does the Upbit SYRUP Listing Present for Savvy Traders? For many traders, a new listing on a major exchange like Upbit is synonymous with opportunity. Here’s why the Upbit SYRUP listing could be a game-changer: Early Price Discovery: New listings often experience significant price movements in their initial hours or days as the market discovers the token’s fair value. This volatility can be highly profitable for those who make accurate predictions and execute timely trades. Increased Arbitrage Potential: With SYRUP available on Upbit, and potentially other exchanges in the future, price discrepancies between platforms could arise, creating arbitrage opportunities for quick-thinking traders. Portfolio Diversification: Adding a new asset like SYRUP, especially one with a strong use case or community, can help diversify a crypto portfolio, spreading risk and potentially capturing growth from emerging sectors. Access to a Growing Ecosystem: If SYRUP is part of a burgeoning blockchain project, investing in the token provides a way to participate in the growth and development of that ecosystem. However, it is crucial to remember that with high potential rewards come high risks. The early stages of a new listing are often characterized by extreme volatility. Navi"
2025-07-25 02:50:23+00:00,Colossal Bitcoin Transfer: $523 Million Whale Move to Coinbase Unveiled,"BitcoinWorld Colossal Bitcoin Transfer: $523 Million Whale Move to Coinbase Unveiled In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes can shift in moments, a recent alert has captured the attention of investors and analysts alike. Imagine a single transaction moving over half a billion dollars – that’s precisely what happened when a colossal Bitcoin transfer of 4,462 BTC, valued at approximately $523 million, moved from an unknown wallet to the popular cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. This significant movement, reported by Whale Alert, immediately sparked widespread speculation about its potential implications for the broader crypto market. Such large-scale movements, often referred to as ‘whale transactions,’ are closely watched because they can signal shifts in market sentiment, potential sell-offs, or even strategic reallocations by major holders. Understanding the context and potential ramifications of this specific Bitcoin transfer is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. What Just Happened? The Colossal Bitcoin Transfer Explained The core of the news is straightforward: a substantial amount of Bitcoin changed hands from an unidentifiable source to a well-known destination. Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service, flagged the transaction, highlighting its immense size and value. While the source wallet remains ‘unknown,’ which is common in the pseudonymous world of cryptocurrency, the destination – Coinbase – is a highly regulated and widely used exchange, suggesting a potential shift towards increased liquidity or a custodial service. This particular Bitcoin transfer is not just a numerical event; it represents a significant concentration of wealth moving within the ecosystem. Such movements can be interpreted in several ways: Liquidity Provision: The funds might be moved to an exchange to be sold, either over-the-counter (OTC) to institutional buyers or directly on the open market. Custodial Services: The owner might be moving their holdings to a more secure, regulated custodial service offered by Coinbase for long-term storage or institutional management. Rebalancing Portfolios: Large holders often rebalance their portfolios, moving assets to facilitate trades into other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Here’s a quick overview of the key details: Detail Value Amount of BTC Transferred 4,462 BTC Approximate USD Value $523 Million Source Wallet Unknown Destination Coinbase Reported By Whale Alert Why Does a Large Bitcoin Transfer Matter to the Market? The immediate aftermath of a significant Bitcoin transfer often involves heightened market speculation. When a large amount of Bitcoin moves to an exchange, the primary concern for many investors is the potential for a sell-off. If a whale intends to liquidate a portion of their holdings, it could increase selling pressure and potentially lead to a price drop, especially if the market depth is insufficient to absorb such a large volume without significant impact. However, it’s not always a bearish signal. Sometimes, large transfers to exchanges are for strategic reasons that do not involve immediate selling. For instance, institutional investors might use exchanges as a gateway for OTC deals, which have minimal impact on spot prices. Alternatively, these funds could be moved to participate in staking, lending protocols, or other decentralized finance (DeFi) activities that require funds to be on a specific platform or in a specific type of wallet. The market’s reaction to such events is often driven by sentiment and interpretation. A single large transaction rarely dictates the long-term trend of Bitcoin, but it can certainly cause short-term volatility and contribute to the ongoing narrative surrounding market stability and investor confidence. Understanding Crypto Whales: Who Are They and What Do They Do? The term ‘crypto whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, enough to significantly influence market prices through their trades. These are often early adopters of Bitcoin, institutional investors, mining pools, or even cryptocurrency exchanges themselves managing their hot and cold wallets. Their movements, including a massive Bitcoin transfer , are watched like hawks because of their potential to move the needle. Whales engage in various activities: Accumulation: Buying large quantities of crypto, often during market dips, to increase their holdings. Distribution: Selling off significant portions of their assets, which can lead to price corrections. Rebalancing: Adjusting their portfolio composition, which might involve moving funds between different assets or platforms. Providing Liquidity: Depositing funds into exchanges to facilitate trading for others. Tracking these entities often involves sophisticated on-chain analysis tools that monitor large transactions, wallet addresses, and exchange flows.

2025-07-25 02:55:23+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Unpacking the Sudden $117,000 Plunge","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Unpacking the Sudden $117,000 Plunge The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic shifts and unpredictable movements, has once again captured headlines as Bitcoin (BTC) experienced a significant downturn, falling below the critical $117,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $116,990.44 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden Bitcoin price drop has sent ripples across the investor community, prompting questions about its causes and potential implications for the broader digital asset landscape. For both seasoned traders and new entrants, understanding such market movements is crucial for navigating the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Bitcoin Price Drop: A Closer Look at the Numbers The recent dip below $117,000 is a moment that demands attention. While daily fluctuations are a norm in the crypto world, breaching a significant psychological and technical support level like $117,000 often signals a shift in market sentiment or underlying factors at play. Just hours before, Bitcoin was holding relatively steady, showing signs of consolidation. However, a sudden sell-off pressure pushed its value down rapidly. This rapid descent highlights the highly liquid and often reactive nature of the cryptocurrency market, where large orders can trigger cascading effects. To put this into perspective, let’s consider the immediate impact: Liquidation Events: A sharp Bitcoin price drop often leads to the liquidation of leveraged positions, especially those with tight stop-losses, further exacerbating the downward trend as more sell orders hit the market. Investor Sentiment Shift: The breach of a key support level can trigger fear among short-term holders, leading to panic selling and a loss of confidence, even if temporary. Technical Analysis Indicators: Traders who rely on technical analysis will now be looking at the next potential support levels, which could be significantly lower, influencing their trading strategies. This particular movement, while not unprecedented in Bitcoin’s history, serves as a reminder of the need for vigilance and a well-informed approach to crypto investing. The market’s response to this Bitcoin price drop will largely depend on whether new buyers step in at these lower levels or if the selling pressure persists. Why the Bitcoin Price Drop? Unpacking Potential Factors at Play Attributing a precise single cause to a market movement like a Bitcoin price drop is often challenging, as it’s typically a confluence of several factors. However, we can identify several potential contributors that might have played a role in this recent downturn: 1. Macroeconomic Headwinds The broader global economic climate significantly influences risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies. Concerns about rising inflation, interest rate hikes by central banks (like the U.S. Federal Reserve), and potential economic slowdowns can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, moving capital out of volatile assets and into safer havens. This ‘flight to safety’ often impacts Bitcoin, which, despite its ‘digital gold’ narrative, still behaves as a growth asset in many respects. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty Ongoing discussions and potential new regulations in major economies can cast a shadow over the crypto market. News of stricter oversight, potential bans, or unfavorable tax policies can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among investors, leading to sell-offs. While no specific major regulatory news immediately preceded this dip, the general climate of regulatory scrutiny is a constant background factor. 3. Whale Movements and Large Liquidations The cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin, is still heavily influenced by ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding vast amounts of BTC. A large sell order from a whale can significantly impact liquidity and trigger a chain reaction, particularly in thinner order books. Additionally, cascading liquidations on derivatives exchanges, where traders use leverage, can amplify price movements. When the price hits certain thresholds, leveraged positions are automatically closed, adding to sell pressure. 4. Profit-Taking After Recent Gains Prior to this dip, Bitcoin had seen periods of accumulation and minor rallies. For short-term traders and those who bought at lower prices, hitting a psychological resistance level or achieving a certain profit margin can trigger a wave of profit-taking. This natural market behavior contributes to downward pressure, especially if a significant number of participants decide to lock in gains simultaneously. 5. Technical Resistance and Chart Patterns From a technical analysis perspective, the $117,000 level might have represented a strong resistance point or the lower bound of a trading range. When such levels are broken, it often signals to algorithmic traders and those following technical indicators that a further downward movement is likely, promptin",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-drop-plunge/,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|RESEARCH,Crypto News|$BTC|BITCOIN|Crypto news|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Market Analysis,BTC,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Unpacking the Sudden $117,000 Plunge.

2025-07-25 03:00:09+00:00,Warning Signs? Bitcoin Approaches Overheated Zone as Retail Still Sits Out,"Bitcoin continues to trade below its record high set earlier this month, hovering above the $119,000 mark. While price action over the past week has shown only a modest 0.3% gain, analysts suggest the market may be nearing a turning point. The sideways movement in price has not deterred the broader bullish outlook, but on-chain indicators now suggest caution may be warranted. One such indicator comes from CryptoQuant’s QuickTake contributor Arab Chain, who flagged potential overheating in Bitcoin’s current market structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Realized Price Chart Reveals Key Defense Zones Amid Volatility Bitcoin Bullish Trend Persists, but Signs Point to Caution In a recent post, the analyst highlighted the behavior of the Bull and Bear Market Cycle Indicator, which now sits in a zone typically associated with strong bullish trends. However, its proximity to the so-called “overheated bull” range has raised concerns about a possible correction on the horizon. The indicator’s historical pattern suggests this zone often precedes a price cooldown, leading investors to consider profit-taking strategies. Arab Chain noted that despite the bullish structure, the indicator’s advance toward overheated territory could prompt speculators to close positions. “The proximity of overheated zones suggests that this is not the right time for a major purchase,” the analyst explained. The insight reflects the broader sentiment that market participants may opt for a wait-and-see approach, anticipating a more favorable re-entry after a correction. Additionally, while the 30-day to 365-day moving averages still support a continued uptrend, they may also signal that a short-term top is forming unless disrupted by new market catalysts. Retail Interest Remains Muted as Institutional Demand Grows Supporting this view, another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, emphasized the role of institutional activity in driving the current cycle. Kesmeci explained that retail investors have reduced their exposure to Bitcoin since early 2023, while large investors have increased their holdings, particularly from early 2024 onward. “This time, the source of the Bitcoin rally is not retail — the big players are in the driver’s seat,” he wrote. This accumulation by high-volume wallets, likely linked to institutions or ETFs, highlights a shift from previous cycles dominated by retail behavior. Related Reading: Bitcoin Final Push? Wave (5) Could Deliver A Spectacular Breakout Kesmeci further pointed to Google Trends data showing that search interest in “Bitcoin” remains subdued compared to previous bull runs. The absence of widespread retail excitement contrasts with the intense public engagement seen during Bitcoin’s surge in 2021. According to Kesmeci, the quiet phase may indicate that retail has not yet entered the market en masse — a stage that historically signals the final leg of a bull cycle. “The crowd has not awakened yet,” he noted, adding that “smart money is currently on stage — and most people are still watching from the sidelines.” Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/warning-signs-bitcoin-approaches-overheated-zone-as-retail-still-sits-out/,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|SPONSORED,Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin market|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto market|cryptocurrency,BTC,"Warning Signs?
