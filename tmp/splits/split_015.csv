2025-07-25 12:30:00+00:00,Top XRP Price Prediction For 2025,"The post Top XRP Price Prediction For 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With XRP recently breaking past $3.60 and sparking fresh excitement, analysts are dropping some bold new targets for where the token could be headed next. From $13 to as high as $30, here’s what the experts are saying, and when they think it might happen. Here are the top XRP Price Predictions . What target are you looking at? Zach Rector: $20 to $30 Cycle Top, But Caution Ahead The 4 year crypto cycles have been disrupted but people are still going to take profits. Which is why I still believe after a $20-$30 XRP top we will see atleast a 50% correction. Not encouraging folks to trade this move but instead, just making sure you are ready to stomach that… — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) July 22, 2025 XRP community figure Zach Rector believes the token has the momentum to hit between $20 and $30 in this bull cycle. However, he also expects a sharp correction to follow, possibly wiping out 50% of those gains. He’s not against the bullish hype but reminds investors that market cycles and human emotions, especially profit-taking, still drive price reversals, no matter how much the space matures. EGRAG: Take Profit on the Way Up, Don’t Wait for $50 #XRP – Just DO IT (UPDATE): This post could be your roadmap to taking profits! My subscribers know how much I emphasize the Dollar Sell Average. Don’t get caught waiting for specific numbers like $27, $17, or even $50. Trust me, no one really knows where we’re headed;… https://t.co/zL46GFAwdq pic.twitter.com/aHxkOy3ncR — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) July 25, 2025 Analyst EGRAG is calling for a more strategic approach. He says XRP could top anywhere from $7 to $30, depending on market conditions, but urges holders to avoid chasing moonshot targets blindly. According to his technicals, the first sell zone lands between $4 and $6, the most realistic peak sits around $11 to $13, and the highest-end projection falls between $27 and $30. Instead of hoping for the perfect top, EGRAG recommends selling gradually using a Dollar Sell Averaging strategy. Tony Severino: Quick Run to $13 Within 40 Days Tony Severino is feeling confident that XRP could spike fast. He believes the token has broken out of a long-term triangle pattern and could mirror its 2018 rally with a quick move to $13, possibly in as little as 40 days. His forecast is among the shortest timelines shared so far. CasiTrades: $26 Possible by Year-End Yes, that could happen… If XRP has the strength to break towards $13, then the final 5th high could reach as high as $26. — CasiTrades (@CasiTrades) June 30, 2025 CasiTrades initially targeted a July peak of $6.50 to $8, but with market momentum growing, they’ve now extended their target. If XRP keeps moving strongly, they expect the token could reach as high as $26 before the end of the year. The forecast depends on continued bullish sentiment and no major macro headwinds. Ripple Researcher Van Wickle: XRP to $14 With Bitcoin at $140K Ripple-focused researcher Van Wickle ties XRP’s potential to Bitcoin’s path. He believes XRP could touch $14 if BTC hits around $140,000. While not putting a strict deadline on the move, the correlation-based outlook suggests this may align with the broader market top. Armando Pantoja: $25 in Two Years Tech investor Armando Pantoja is taking the longer view, predicting XRP could hit $25 within the next two years. He dismisses concerns about market cap limitations and says real-world adoption and utility will drive the price higher over time. In short, while XRP might have a huge run ahead, the smartest move is to plan, take profits when they make sense, and be ready for any twist the market throws your way. Though timelines and expectations vary, most analysts agree that the ride could be explosive, but not without corrections along the way. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcod",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/top-xrp-price-prediction-for-2025/,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,News|Ripple (XRP),BTC,"Top XRP Price Prediction For 2025.

2025-07-25 12:35:56+00:00,"Robert Kiyosaki Recommends Owning Real BTC, Not ‘Paper’ ETFs","The Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) market is expanding and raking in billions of dollars in capital. Despite this growth demonstrating rising adoption of the leading digital asset, finance guru Robert Kiyosaki believes ETFs are for the average investor. Unfortunately, Kiyosaki thinks it is unwise to remain an average investor because such market participants are restricted to paper investments and not the real deal. Own Real BTC, Not Paper In his latest tweet praising Bitcoin, Kiyosaki urged his followers to be wary of ETFs, which he referred to as “paper.” The American entrepreneur stated that he has come to realize that ETFs simplify the investing experience for the average investor. So, he recommends such products, but with caution. While the average investor can invest their capital in Bitcoin, silver, and gold ETFs, Kiyosaki advises that they should know when it’s time to go for real assets. The author of Rich Dad Poor Dad likened owning ETFs to having pictures of guns for personal defense. In essence, such holdings are useless in the face of danger. “Sometimes it’s best to have real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a gun. Know the differences when it is best to have real and when it’s best to have paper,” the entrepreneur stated. According to the businessman, understanding the difference between ETFs and real assets, as well as how to leverage them, makes an investor better than average. An Easy Way to Get Rich Over the years, Kiyosaki has become a Bitcoin bull and advocate, constantly urging his followers to buy BTC and precious metals. The author believes the United States dollar is doomed and that millions of Americans holding the fiat currency will be financially wiped out when it collapses. However, BTC, gold, and silver holders will remain afloat. Two months ago, Kiyosaki went as far as stating that bitcoin has made it so easy for anyone to get rich, as the asset obeys the two most important laws of money. He insisted that most people will remain poor for as long as they hold onto assets that violate these laws. While the U.S. economy faces the risk of collapse in the long term, Kiyosaki sees bitcoin’s value skyrocketing to $1 million. Even when BTC eventually reaches that level, the finance guru says he will continue to buy the digital asset, so as not to regret not accumulating more when the price goes higher.

While whales generally hold onto their BTC, market makers posted multiple transactions big enough to sway the price. BTC declined to a two-week low, recently dipping as low as $115,000. The leading coin took a step back based on long liquidations. However, the spot market also played a significant role, as market makers emptied some of their reserves on the market. Spot markets had to absorb additional inflows from Galaxy Digital , with smaller inflows from Jump Crypto. Wintermute also activated its wallets after receiving inflows from Binance. The activities of the market makers had wider repercussions, as they triggered some of the recent liquidations. Demand and holding for BTC remained strong, as ETFs and treasuries keep buying. However, the directed, short-term selling of market makers is still a factor for fluctuations of a few thousand dollars. Galaxy Digital leads the selling trend The past day has seen significant outflows from Galaxy Digital’s reserves, reaching exchanges for direct sales. On-chain data shows the crypto custodial service and market maker moved a total of 30,000 BTC, with most sent to exchange hot wallets. The markets had to absorb up to $3.5B in new BTC inflows. Galaxy Digital now stores $1.15B in stablecoins. Update: #GalaxyDigital has transferred nearly 30,000 $BTC ($3.5B) out today, most of which went directly to exchanges and were sold.

The early buyer moved 80,000 BTC , some acquired at under $1. After moving the coins to new addresses, the whale deposited all the funds to Galaxy Digital. On-chain investigators noted that the market maker managed to place up to 70,000 BTC on exchanges, with 10K remaining as part of the remaining balance on Galaxy Digital. Galaxy Digital placed some of the BTC through BitStamp , an exchange widely used during previous bull cycles. Market makers cut their BTC reserves Other market makers also saw outflows of their BTC reserves. Jump Crypto sold hundreds of BTC in the past days, and is down from 1.3K BTC to 894 BTC. Cumberland also continued to send BTC to multiple exchanges, especially Gemini. The market maker is down to 62 BTC in one of its hot wallets. One of the most influential market makers is still Wintermute. Previously its founder Evgeny Gaevoy stated the marker maker ran out of BTC on its OTC market. However, Wintermute never goes without the BTC it needs for market making activities. According to the Arkham Intelligence on-chain data, Wintermute kept receiving BTC from Binance in the past 24 hours.

He has been appointed co-CEO of SharpLink, a company notably recognized as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH). This strategic move not only underscores the growing convergence of traditional finance with the burgeoning crypto sector but also highlights the increasing allure of decentralized technologies for seasoned institutional leaders. For those closely observing the evolution of cryptocurrencies, this news signifies more than just a change in executive roles; it represents a powerful endorsement of the crypto ecosystem’s maturity and potential. Joseph Chalom , with his deep expertise cultivated at one of the world’s largest asset managers, stepping into a leadership role at a crypto-native firm like SharpLink, speaks volumes about where the future of global finance is headed. Who is Joseph Chalom and What Was His Impact at BlackRock? Before his recent transition, Joseph Chalom was a name synonymous with innovation within the traditional finance giant, BlackRock. As the head of their digital asset and fintech strategy, he was at the forefront of exploring how a behemoth like BlackRock could navigate and eventually embrace the world of cryptocurrencies. His tenure was marked by significant milestones, most notably his instrumental role in the launch of BlackRock’s groundbreaking iShares Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. These ETFs were not just new financial products; they were a testament to BlackRock’s strategic pivot towards legitimizing digital assets for mainstream investors. Chalom’s work involved intricate regulatory navigation, market analysis, and the development of robust frameworks to bring these complex assets into a traditional investment vehicle. His departure from BlackRock in June, following these successful launches, signaled a readiness for new challenges within the very industry he helped usher into institutional view. His insights, particularly his description of Ethereum as a ‘growing foundation of global finance,’ reveal a profound understanding and belief in the transformative power of blockchain technology beyond mere speculative assets. This perspective is crucial as he steps into a role at a company deeply invested in the Ethereum ecosystem. Understanding SharpLink: A Key Player in the Ethereum Ecosystem SharpLink might not be a household name to everyone, but within the crypto community, it holds a significant position. The company is recognized as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum (ETH), a fact that immediately places it at the heart of the institutional adoption narrative for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Co-founded by Rob Phythian, SharpLink has positioned itself as a major stakeholder in the Ethereum network, likely engaging in various activities such as staking, decentralized finance (DeFi) participation, or strategic investments in projects built on Ethereum. Their substantial ETH holdings indicate a long-term conviction in Ethereum’s potential as a foundational layer for the next generation of the internet and global finance. This commitment aligns perfectly with Joseph Chalom’s publicly expressed views on Ethereum’s future, creating a powerful synergy between his vision and SharpLink’s established presence. Why is Joseph Chalom’s Move to SharpLink So Significant? The appointment of Joseph Chalom as co-CEO alongside Rob Phythian at SharpLink is far more than just executive reshuffling; it’s a potent signal of the ongoing maturation of the crypto industry. Here’s why this move is particularly noteworthy: Bridging TradFi and Crypto: Chalom’s background at BlackRock provides an invaluable bridge between the traditional financial world and the innovative, often disruptive, crypto space. His understanding of institutional requirements, risk management, and regulatory landscapes will be crucial for SharpLink’s growth and its interactions with mainstream finance. Validation of Ethereum: For Ethereum enthusiasts and investors, Chalom’s move serves as a strong validation. His belief in ETH as a ‘growing foundation of global finance’ is now backed by his direct involvement with a major ETH holder, potentially inspiring further institutional confidence and investment. Strategic Growth for SharpLink: With Chalom’s strategic acumen, SharpLink is poised to expand its influence and operations within the Ethereum ecosystem. This could involve deeper dives into DeFi, NFTs, or other Web3 initiatives, leveraging Chalom’s experience in scaling financial products.

Financial losses caused by the phenomenon this year are expected to exceed the 10 billion rubles in damages registered by Russian authorities in 2024, according to observers interviewed by the local press. Video cards sought for mining, gaming and AI The growing spread of illegal mining in Russia has become evident by the surging sales of graphics processing units (GPUs). Also known as video cards, these are often used in the type of rigs Russians install in basements and garages or hide near electric substations to tap into the grid for free. The so-called “black mining” is among the most common crypto crimes in the country, and a number of regions are struggling to deal with its consequences, the Russian daily Izvestia wrote in an article published Friday. Both “black miners,” who mint on stolen energy, and “gray miners,” taking advantage of subsidized electricity in parts of Russia, need the powerful chips. And as a result, their sales have almost tripled in the first half of 2025, the newspaper revealed. M.Video-Eldorado, a leading Russian consumer electronics retailer , said demand for GPUs in its stores grew by 233%, in terms of revenues and units sold during the said period. The company, also a major e-commerce operator, attributes the spike to increased interest in gaming and AI applications. Miners have contributed as well, IT specialist Daniil Arzhakov is convinced. He noted that the stronger Russian ruble has made the better-performing and more efficient video cards cheaper and more accessible on the domestic market. High GPU demand seen as a sign of illegal mining Rising graphics card sales are an indication of growing illegal mining, according to Vadim Kovalenko, a lecturer at the eSports Department of the Synergy University. He warned that the trend could cause an energy crisis and escalate the scale of shady businesses. He is concerned Russia may be moving in the footsteps of countries like Iran and Kazakhstan , unless it gets the situation under control. They blamed illegal mining for blackouts and breakdowns in both countries, before authorities took measures to curb the activity. Kovalenko elaborated: “Without rules — established tariffs, government control, and fight against theft — power outages and an increase in criminal mining are expected.” And the Russian government has been working in that direction, both on federal and local level. Mining is now prohibited in about a dozen regions, from Siberia to occupied Ukraine, including the North Caucasus, where illicit mining is booming in Dagestan, Ingushetia and Karachay-Cherkessia. A ban on coin mining in data centers is advancing in parliament to reserve their capacities for AI development, and a proposal to remotely disconnect even legal crypto farms from the grid, to limit consumption in peak hours, is also under consideration . Igor Bederov, founder of the Russian company Internet Search, commented: “Black mining is an attractive activity in a number of regions of the Russian Federation. The Caucasus remains the leader in terms of number of black miners, that is, those who are engaged in the theft of electricity.” The damages inflicted by illegal mining facilities last year amounted to around 10 billion rubles (over $125 million), according to analysts at the Stolypin Institute for Economy of Growth. They are yet to publish their estimate for this year, and the losses are likely to exceed the previous total. Russia legalized the mining of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in 2024. Both companies and individual entrepreneurs operating in the sector are required to register with the Russian tax authority.

2025-07-25 13:02:53+00:00,"BitMine Immersion Buys $2B in Ether, Aiming for 5% Supply Control","Bitcoin mining firm BitMine Immersion Technologies has made waves in the crypto markets, purchasing over $2 billion worth of Ether within just 16 days, making it the largest corporate holder of ETH among newly formed Ether treasury companies. In a statement on Thursday, BitMine revealed it had acquired 566,776 Ether, valued at over $2.03 billion, as part of its aggressive treasury strategy. Tom Lee, managing partner at FundStrat and chairman of the company, confirmed that the firm is “well on our way to achieving our goal of acquiring and staking 5% of the overall ETH supply.” With Ether’s current circulating supply, this target equates to around 6 million ETH, valued at roughly $22 billion at current market prices. BitMine’s bold move signals a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum , mirroring Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy but on a larger scale if the company’s ambitions are fulfilled. BitMine Surpasses SharpLink as Largest Ether Holder BitMine’s buying spree has pushed it ahead of SharpLink Gaming, which recently reported a purchase of 79,949 ETH , bringing its holdings to 360,807 ETH worth approximately $1.3 billion. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Foundation holds around 237,500 ETH, placing it behind both BitMine and SharpLink in corporate Ether holdings. Strategic Ether Reserves data shows that 61 strategic entities currently hold 2.31 million ETH, representing 1.91% of the total supply and valued at around $8.46 billion. BitMine’s goal of holding 5% would significantly expand corporate Ether holdings within these reserves, establishing the firm as a major player in Ethereum’s ecosystem. The comparison with Bitcoin treasury strategies is notable, with Bitbo data showing that 206 firms collectively hold over 3.4 million Bitcoin, worth more than $408 billion and accounting for 16.5% of Bitcoin’s capped supply. Unlike Bitcoin, Ether does not have a fixed maximum supply, making BitMine’s strategy dependent on Ethereum’s burn mechanics and issuance over time. Stock Prices Soar Amid Ether Treasury Moves The Ether accumulation strategy has also delivered significant gains for BitMine’s share price. Following its Ether treasury announcement, the stock (BMNR) surged over 3,000%, reaching an all-time high of $135 on July 3. Similarly, SharpLink Gaming’s (SBET) share price spiked 171% to $79.21 after announcing its Ether pivot on May 27. The latest institutional moves signal a shift focus from Bitcoin-heavy reserves to Ethereum as a long-term treasury and staking asset, while reinforcing confidence in Ether’s evolving role within corporate balance sheets and staking ecosystems.

2025-07-25 13:10:10+00:00,Bitcoin Futures: Unpacking the Astonishing Record High in Open Interest,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Futures: Unpacking the Astonishing Record High in Open Interest Ever wondered what truly fuels the dynamic movements of the cryptocurrency market? Beyond the daily price swings, the derivatives market often provides deeper insights into investor sentiment and potential future trends. Today, the spotlight is firmly on Bitcoin futures , as open interest in these crucial contracts has soared to an unprecedented all-time high. This remarkable surge is more than just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of widespread bullish conviction, even as Bitcoin navigates its usual market volatility. Understanding the Mechanics: What Are Bitcoin Futures and Open Interest? Before we dive into the implications of this record-breaking figure, let’s demystify some key terms. Bitcoin futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of Bitcoin without actually owning the underlying asset. It’s an agreement to buy or sell Bitcoin at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Alongside traditional futures, perpetual contracts are immensely popular in crypto. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts have no expiry date, mimicking spot market prices while allowing for leverage. This flexibility makes them a favorite among traders. So, what exactly is open interest ? Think of it as the total number of outstanding derivative contracts (both futures and perpetuals) that have not yet been settled or closed. It measures the total capital committed to these positions. A rising open interest suggests more money is flowing into the market, indicating growing participation and often, stronger conviction among traders. When open interest hits an all-time high, as it has with Bitcoin futures at a staggering $44.6 billion, it signifies an extraordinary level of market engagement and conviction. Another crucial metric is the funding rate . On perpetual contracts, funding rates are small payments exchanged between long and short position holders. A positive funding rate means that long position holders are paying short position holders, reflecting a prevailing bullish sentiment where more traders are betting on price increases. The current slightly positive funding rates across major exchanges underscore this continued confidence in further upside for Bitcoin. The Astonishing Surge: A Deep Dive into the $44.6 Billion Milestone for Bitcoin Futures According to DL News, citing robust data from CryptoQuant, the combined open interest in Bitcoin futures and perpetual contracts has reached an astonishing $44.6 billion. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s an all-time high, surpassing previous peaks and underscoring a significant shift in market dynamics. This monumental figure has been achieved even as Bitcoin recently pulled back from its all-time high above $123,000, indicating that the underlying belief in its future growth remains unshaken. The sheer scale of this current record high suggests that a substantial amount of capital is positioned for a continuation of Bitcoin’s upward trend. Most traders are not just holding positions; they are holding long positions , betting on higher prices. Key observations from this surge include: Dominant Exchanges: Major platforms like Binance, CME, OKX, and Bybit collectively account for a significant portion of this open interest, indicating strong institutional and large-scale retail participation. Contract Types: While traditional futures contribute, perpetual contracts often drive the bulk of the volume and open interest due to their flexibility and leverage options. Global Sentiment: The global nature of crypto trading means this open interest reflects bullish sentiment from diverse regions, from Asia to North America and Europe. Why Are Traders Placing Such Massive Long Bets on Bitcoin Futures? The question on everyone’s mind is: what’s driving this immense bullish sentiment in Bitcoin futures ? Several powerful factors are converging to create this environment of high confidence and increased long positioning: Institutional Influx and Spot ETFs: The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers can now gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated vehicles, legitimizing the asset and attracting significant new investment. Macroeconomic Landscape: Persistent inflation concerns and potential interest rate cuts by central banks are pushing investors to seek alternative assets that can hedge against currency debasement. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ fits this narrative perfectly. The Halving Event’s Influence: While the recent halving event has already occurred, its historical impact on Bitcoin’s price is well-documented. Each halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, creating a supply shock that, historically, has led to significant price appreciation.

A positive funding rate means that long position holders are paying short position holders, reflecting a prevailing bullish sentiment where more traders are betting on price increases. The current slightly positive funding rates across major exchanges underscore this continued confidence in further upside for Bitcoin. The Astonishing Surge: A Deep Dive into the $44.6 Billion Milestone for Bitcoin Futures According to DL News, citing robust data from CryptoQuant, the combined open interest in Bitcoin futures and perpetual contracts has reached an astonishing $44.6 billion. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s an all-time high, surpassing previous peaks and underscoring a significant shift in market dynamics. This monumental figure has been achieved even as Bitcoin recently pulled back from its all-time high above $123,000, indicating that the underlying belief in its future growth remains unshaken. The sheer scale of this current record high suggests that a substantial amount of capital is positioned for a continuation of Bitcoin’s upward trend. Most traders are not just holding positions; they are holding long positions , betting on higher prices. Key observations from this surge include: Dominant Exchanges: Major platforms like Binance, CME, OKX, and Bybit collectively account for a significant portion of this open interest, indicating strong institutional and large-scale retail participation. Contract Types: While traditional futures contribute, perpetual contracts often drive the bulk of the volume and open interest due to their flexibility and leverage options. Global Sentiment: The global nature of crypto trading means this open interest reflects bullish sentiment from diverse regions, from Asia to North America and Europe. Why Are Traders Placing Such Massive Long Bets on Bitcoin Futures? The question on everyone’s mind is: what’s driving this immense bullish sentiment in Bitcoin futures ? Several powerful factors are converging to create this environment of high confidence and increased long positioning: Institutional Influx and Spot ETFs: The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers can now gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated vehicles, legitimizing the asset and attracting significant new investment. Macroeconomic Landscape: Persistent inflation concerns and potential interest rate cuts by central banks are pushing investors to seek alternative assets that can hedge against currency debasement. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ fits this narrative perfectly. The Halving Event’s Influence: While the recent halving event has already occurred, its historical impact on Bitcoin’s price is well-documented. Each halving reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, creating a supply shock that, historically, has led to significant price appreciation. Traders are be"

2025-07-25 13:25:11+00:00,Crypto Cycle: Revolutionizing Market Dynamics Beyond the Four-Year Pattern,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Cycle: Revolutionizing Market Dynamics Beyond the Four-Year Pattern For years, the cryptocurrency world has lived by an unspoken rule: the four-year crypto cycle . It’s been as predictable as the seasons, often tied to Bitcoin’s halving events, bringing with it periods of exhilarating highs and gut-wrenching lows. But what if this deeply ingrained pattern is starting to unravel? What if the very foundations that have dictated market behavior are shifting, paving the way for something entirely different? That’s precisely the provocative argument put forth by Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise. In a recent observation shared on X, Hougan suggests that the traditional four-year crypto cycle , as we know it, is losing its grip. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental re-evaluation of how the crypto market operates, driven by powerful new forces that could reshape its future trajectory. Understanding the Traditional Four-Year Crypto Cycle: Was it a Myth or a Blueprint? Before we delve into why the old rules might be faltering, let’s briefly revisit what the traditional four-year crypto cycle entailed. Historically, this cycle was heavily influenced by several key factors, creating a rhythm that many investors learned to anticipate: Bitcoin Halving Events: Occurring roughly every four years, these events cut the reward for mining new Bitcoin by half, historically leading to supply shocks and price surges in the subsequent months. Many believed this was the primary engine of the cycle. Macroeconomic Cycles: The broader global financial environment, particularly interest rate cycles and liquidity conditions, often played a significant role. Periods of negative or low interest rates typically encouraged risk-on assets like crypto. Boom and Bust Narratives: Each cycle often culminated in a speculative frenzy, followed by a dramatic market correction or “crypto winter,” purging excesses and setting the stage for the next upswing. Retail-Driven Volatility: Early cycles were largely driven by retail investor sentiment, leading to exaggerated price movements and periods of intense FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt). This pattern offered a somewhat comforting, albeit volatile, roadmap for investors. But as the crypto market matures, its dynamics are evolving. Why the Old Rules Are Faltering: Insights from Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Matt Hougan’s thesis isn’t just about a feeling; it’s rooted in observable shifts in the market’s underlying drivers. He identifies several reasons why the traditional four-year crypto cycle is weakening: Diminishing Importance of Block Halving? While Bitcoin halvings will continue to reduce new supply, their impact on overall market dynamics might be less pronounced than in previous cycles. As the market capitalization of Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem grows, the proportional impact of halving the new supply becomes smaller. The market is deeper, more liquid, and influenced by a wider array of factors beyond just supply-side shocks. The End of Negative Rate Cycles For much of the last decade, global central banks maintained ultra-low or even negative interest rates, pushing investors into riskier assets in search of yield. This environment was highly conducive to crypto’s growth. However, with inflation concerns and a global shift towards higher interest rates, this tailwind has largely dissipated. The absence of a negative rate cycle removes a significant historical driver of speculative capital into crypto. Reduced Blow-Up Risk and Market Maturity Past cycles were often punctuated by dramatic “blow-ups”—major project failures, exchange collapses, or liquidity crises (think Mt. Gox, Luna/Terra, FTX). These events acted as resets, clearing out bad actors and unsustainable projects. While risks will always exist, the crypto ecosystem has matured significantly. Infrastructure is more robust, regulatory scrutiny is increasing, and investors are arguably more sophisticated. This reduction in systemic blow-up risk means fewer dramatic market purges, leading to a potentially smoother, albeit less explosive, growth trajectory. A New Cyclical Threat: Rising Treasury Companies Hougan also points to a new, emerging cyclical threat: the rise of Treasury companies. As interest rates rise, traditional, low-risk investments like U.S. Treasury bonds become more attractive. This could divert institutional and even retail capital away from riskier assets like crypto, posing a new challenge to market liquidity and capital flows. This dynamic adds another layer of complexity to the market that wasn’t as prominent in previous cycles. New Pillars of Growth: What’s Driving the “Sustained Steady Boom” in the Crypto Cycle? Despite the weakening of old drivers, Hougan isn’t bearish. Quite the opposite.

2025-07-25 13:55:11+00:00,US Stock Market Momentum: Major Indices Open Higher Today,"BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Momentum: Major Indices Open Higher Today In a significant start to the trading day, the US Stock Market has opened with a clear upward trajectory, signaling a robust sentiment among investors. This positive momentum across major indices offers a glimpse into the current economic landscape and its potential implications, not just for traditional portfolios but also for the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. For those closely watching the ebb and flow of global finance, today’s opening provides a compelling narrative of cautious optimism. What’s Fueling the Initial Gains in the US Stock Market? Today’s market open saw key indices registering gains, painting a picture of renewed confidence. Let’s look at the numbers: S&P500: +0.11% – This broad market index, representing 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States, saw a modest but meaningful uptick. Its movement often serves as a barometer for the overall health of the US Stock Market . NASDAQ: +0.25% – Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, NASDAQ’s stronger gain suggests investor appetite for innovation and future-oriented companies. Dow Jones Industrial Average (Dow): +0.14% – Comprising 30 significant US companies, the Dow’s positive start indicates strength in established industrial and financial sectors. These initial gains are often influenced by a confluence of factors. Positive economic data releases, such as better-than-expected jobs reports or easing inflation figures, can immediately boost investor confidence. Similarly, strong corporate earnings reports from bellwether companies can signal underlying business health, encouraging further investment across the US Stock Market . Why Do These US Stock Market Movements Matter to You? Whether you’re a seasoned investor, a budding trader, or simply someone keeping an eye on their savings, the performance of the US Stock Market has far-reaching implications. These movements are not just abstract numbers; they reflect the collective sentiment about the economy’s future, corporate profitability, and consumer spending power. A rising market can signify economic expansion, potentially leading to job growth and increased prosperity. Moreover, the performance of the US Stock Market often sets the tone for global markets. Given the interconnectedness of today’s financial world, a strong showing in New York can ripple across exchanges in Europe and Asia, influencing investment decisions worldwide. For everyday individuals, this can impact everything from their retirement accounts and mutual funds to the availability of credit and the cost of goods. The Interplay: How US Stock Market Performance Impacts Crypto For the cryptocurrency community, the movements in the traditional US Stock Market are increasingly relevant. While once thought to be entirely uncorrelated, digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown a growing tendency to move in tandem with major stock indices, particularly the NASDAQ. Here’s how the relationship often plays out: Risk-On Sentiment: When the US Stock Market performs well, it often signals a ‘risk-on’ environment. In such periods, investors are more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets, which can include cryptocurrencies. This increased appetite for risk can drive up crypto prices. Liquidity Flows: Strong stock market performance can free up capital or create a sense of wealth effect, leading some investors to diversify into crypto. Conversely, a downturn in stocks might lead investors to pull funds from riskier assets, including crypto, to cover losses or move to perceived safe havens. Macroeconomic Influences: Both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies are influenced by overarching macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical stability. For instance, concerns about inflation might lead investors to seek hedges, which some view Bitcoin as, while rising interest rates might make less liquid, speculative assets less attractive. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional players enter the crypto space, their investment decisions are often informed by broader market conditions. If their traditional portfolios are performing well, they might be more inclined to allocate a portion to digital assets. Today’s positive opening in the US Stock Market , therefore, could be seen as a supportive backdrop for the crypto market, potentially fostering a more positive sentiment among digital asset investors. Navigating the Current Market: Opportunities and Challenges While the initial upward movement in the US Stock Market is encouraging, a prudent investor always considers both the opportunities and potential challenges. The current environment presents a complex interplay of factors that warrant careful attention. What Opportunities Does a Rising US Stock Market Present?

2025-07-25 13:55:46+00:00,Ethereum ETFs Pull In $8.7B in First Year After Almost $5B Rush in Past Two Weeks,"The first wave of U.S.-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has racked up nearly $8.7 million in net inflows in its first year on the market, according to public data compiled since the funds launched on July 23, 2024, despite heavy outflows out of Grayscale''s Ethereum Trust (ETHE). That performance, while modest compared to their bitcoin counterparts, arrives alongside a surge in investor activity and price momentum. Over the past two weeks alone, the ETFs brought in more than $4.6 billion — nearly half of their total annual inflows — coinciding with a sharp uptick in ether’s ( ETH ) price. ETH gained 26% during the week of July 14, after rising 16% the week before, outpacing much of the broader market. It is now trading at $3,704, up 11% on the year. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) stood out among the pack by crossing $10 billion in assets under management this week. The milestone makes ETHA the third-fastest ETF in history to reach that figure, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Eric Balchunas . Only BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) got there faster.

2025-07-25 14:00:13+00:00,"What You Would Have Now If You’d Bought XRP With Your $1,200 Stimulus Check In 2020","When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the U.S. government responded with a series of stimulus checks to help Americans weather the financial storm. While most recipients used the funds to cover essential expenses, some saw a rare opportunity to invest in digital assets like XRP . Five years later, the returns on such a move would be nothing short of remarkable. A Look Back at the COVID-19 Stimulus Checks In March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, launching the first round of relief payments. Eligible individuals received up to $1,200, while married couples received $2,400, plus $500 per child under 17. By the end of that month, the U.S. government had issued nearly 162 million payments, distributing over $270 billion. A second round of payments was approved in December 2020 under the COVID-related Tax Relief Act. This time, individuals received up to $600, and married couples received $1,200. The benefit for children increased to $600 per dependent. These payments reached Americans through direct deposits, checks, and prepaid debit cards starting in late December. Though many used these funds to manage bills and everyday expenses, an investment in XRP during these periods would have yielded astonishing gains. The XRP Investment Scenario When the first stimulus checks were delivered in April 2020, XRP was priced around $0.18. Investing the full $1,200 would have bought you approximately 6,666 XRP tokens. By the time the second round of checks arrived in December 2020, XRP was trading at about $0.20. A $600 investment then would have added another 3,000 XRP to your holdings. In total, a combined investment of $1,800 across both rounds of stimulus payments would have secured you 9,666 XRP. Fast forward to today, July 2025, with XRP trading around $3.20, those tokens would now be worth roughly $31,000. That’s a staggering 1,622% return on investment, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 77%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP vs. Bitcoin: Which Would Have Performed Better? To provide perspective, let’s compare XRP’s performance with Bitcoin (BTC) over the same timeframe. In April 2020, Bitcoin was priced at around $6,800. By December 2020, it had climbed to $26,000. If you had invested $1,200 and $600 in BTC during those two windows, you would have acquired roughly 0.1994 BTC. With Bitcoin now valued at approximately $118,000, your BTC investment would be worth about $23,538, impressive, but still lower than XRP’s $31,000. This comparison highlights how XRP outpaced even the largest and most established cryptocurrency over the past five years, at least from this investment angle. Timeless Wisdom From Investment Icons The idea of investing unexpected windfalls aligns with principles shared by legendary investors. Warren Buffett famously advised: “Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.” His philosophy underscores the importance of prioritizing long-term financial growth.

When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the U.S. government responded with a series of stimulus checks to help Americans weather the financial storm. While most recipients used the funds to cover essential expenses, some saw a rare opportunity to invest in digital assets like XRP . Five years later, the returns on such a move would be nothing short of remarkable. A Look Back at the COVID-19 Stimulus Checks In March 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, launching the first round of relief payments. Eligible individuals received up to $1,200, while married couples received $2,400, plus $500 per child under 17. By the end of that month, the U.S. government had issued nearly 162 million payments, distributing over $270 billion. A second round of payments was approved in December 2020 under the COVID-related Tax Relief Act. This time, individuals received up to $600, and married couples received $1,200. The benefit for children increased to $600 per dependent. These payments reached Americans through direct deposits, checks, and prepaid debit cards starting in late December. Though many used these funds to manage bills and everyday expenses, an investment in XRP during these periods would have yielded astonishing gains. The XRP Investment Scenario When the first stimulus checks were delivered in April 2020, XRP was priced around $0.18. Investing the full $1,200 would have bought you approximately 6,666 XRP tokens. By the time the second round of checks arrived in December 2020, XRP was trading at about $0.20. A $600 investment then would have added another 3,000 XRP to your holdings. In total, a combined investment of $1,800 across both rounds of stimulus payments would have secured you 9,666 XRP. Fast forward to today, July 2025, with XRP trading around $3.20, those tokens would now be worth roughly $31,000. That’s a staggering 1,622% return on investment, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 77%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP vs. Bitcoin: Which Would Have Performed Better? To provide perspective, let’s compare XRP’s performance with Bitcoin (BTC) over the same timeframe. In April 2020, Bitcoin was priced at around $6,800. By December 2020, it had climbed to $26,000. If you had invested $1,200 and $600 in BTC during those two windows, you would have acquired roughly 0.1994 BTC. With Bitcoin now valued at approximately $118,000, your BTC investment would be worth about $23,538, impressive, but still lower than XRP’s $31,000. This comparison highlights how XRP outpaced even the largest and most established cryptocurrency over the past five years, at least from this investment angle. Timeless Wisdom From Investment Icons The idea of investing unexpected windfalls aligns with principles shared by legendary investors. Warren Buffett famously advised: “Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving.” His philosophy underscores the importance of prioritizing long-term financial growth. Likewise, Bill Gross, co-founder of PIMCO, emphasized the value of having cash ready for the right opportunity. Strategic patience, coupled with preparedness, often separates average outcomes from extraordinary success. In hindsight, the COVID-19 stimulus checks provided a golden chance for such investment foresight, and XRP turned out to be one of the most lucrative paths.

2025-07-25 14:08:39+00:00,Novogratz Predicts Ether May Outperform Bitcoin Amid Institutional Buying Frenzy,"Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz believes Ether is on track to outperform Bitcoin within the next six months, driven by rapid institutional accumulation and a tightening supply. Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Novogratz said , “There’s not a lot of supply of ETH, and so I think ETH probably has a chance to outperform Bitcoin in the next three to six months.” At the time of his remarks, Ether was trading around $3,618, and Novogratz pointed to the $4,000 mark as a key level for the asset. “We feel kind of destined to at least knock on the $4,000 ceiling a few times,” he said, noting that a breakout above this level would push Ether into “price discovery” mode, potentially opening the door for new all-time highs. Major Firms Fuel Ether Narrative Novogratz highlighted the “really powerful” narrative forming around Ether, driven by high-profile corporate buyers entering the market. BitMine Immersion Technologies disclosed on Thursday that it holds 566,776 ETH worth over $2.03 billion, while Sharplink Gaming reported 360,807 ETH worth approximately $1.29 billion. Additionally, Ether Machine, a new firm preparing to list on Nasdaq under the ticker “ETHM,” will launch with over 400,000 ETH valued at more than $1.5 billion under management. These developments reflect a broader institutional pivot toward ETH, with Novogratz noting, “They are raising capital every day and buying Ether.” His outlook aligns with BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes, who predicted earlier this week that ETH could reach $10,000 by the end of the year if the momentum continues. On the technical front, ETH has shown strong relative performance against Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio up 36.53% over the past 30 days, according to TradingView data. Bitcoin Still Poised for Growth Despite Ether’s rising strength, Novogratz remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory . He indicated that a Bitcoin price of $150,000 is a “decent target,” emphasizing that as long as the current macro narrative holds, the crypto market appears “destined to go higher.” Bitfinex analysts also noted in a recent report that if Bitcoin’s uptrend persists, the next major target could be $136,000, though they cautioned it may align with overextended bullish sentiment and potential local tops. Novogratz acknowledged potential macro risks, cautioning that a reversal in US monetary policy could alter his outlook. “If Trump decides the country doesn’t need lower rates, that would change my thesis,” he said, “but until that happens, I think we’re heading to 150.” The post Novogratz Predicts Ether May Outperform Bitcoin Amid Institutional Buying Frenzy appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",thecoinrise,https://thecoinrise.com/novogratz-predicts-ether-may-outperform-bitcoin-amid-institutional-buying-frenzy/,BTC|ETH|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE,Market News|Ether price|Ethereum vs Bitcoin,BTC,"Novogratz Predicts Ether May Outperform Bitcoin Amid Institutional Buying Frenzy.

2025-07-25 14:40:10+00:00,Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Volcon’s Astonishing $375 Million Bet Signals a New Era,"BitcoinWorld Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Volcon’s Astonishing $375 Million Bet Signals a New Era In a move that has sent ripples across both the traditional financial markets and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world, Volcon, a Nasdaq-listed all-electric power sports company, has significantly ramped up its digital asset portfolio. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a profound statement on the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , signaling a deepening institutional embrace of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. For many, this development underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role from a speculative asset to a legitimate treasury reserve. Volcon’s Astonishing Leap into Bitcoin Holdings The news broke with considerable excitement: Volcon announced a substantial purchase of 2,903 Bitcoin (BTC), dramatically increasing its total holdings to an impressive 3,183 BTC. According to reports from prominent crypto observers like @btcNLNico on X, these holdings are now valued at approximately $375 million. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic pivot that positions Volcon among a growing cohort of publicly traded companies diversifying their balance sheets with digital gold. For a company primarily known for its innovative electric motorcycles and off-road vehicles, this move into the volatile realm of cryptocurrency might seem unexpected to some. However, it aligns with a broader macroeconomic narrative that has seen corporations explore alternative asset classes to hedge against inflation, seek growth opportunities, and appeal to a new generation of tech-savvy investors. Volcon’s decision to accumulate such a significant amount of Bitcoin is a testament to the increasing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential as a store of value. Why Are Companies Embracing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? The question on many minds is, why are more and more corporations, like Volcon, choosing to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin? The reasons are multifaceted, blending macroeconomic trends with a forward-looking vision of financial strategy. Here are some key drivers behind the surge in corporate Bitcoin adoption : Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, traditional fiat currencies are experiencing a decline in purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its capped supply of 21 million coins, is seen by many as a superior inflation hedge, akin to digital gold. Diversification of Treasury Reserves: Companies are looking beyond traditional cash and bond holdings to diversify their treasury reserves. Bitcoin offers a non-correlated asset that can potentially enhance overall portfolio returns and reduce reliance on volatile fiat currencies. Growth Opportunity: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically outperformed most traditional assets over the long term. Companies view Bitcoin as a high-growth asset that can significantly appreciate in value, boosting their balance sheets and shareholder value. Technological Innovation and Future-Proofing: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with the cutting edge of financial technology. It signals an embrace of innovation and a readiness to participate in the evolving digital economy, potentially attracting tech-focused talent and investors. Investor Appeal: For many investors, particularly younger demographics, a company’s embrace of Bitcoin can be a significant draw. It demonstrates a progressive mindset and an understanding of emerging asset classes, potentially increasing stock appeal and valuation. The MicroStrategy Blueprint: Paving the Way for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Volcon’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a trend largely pioneered by MicroStrategy, led by its outspoken CEO Michael Saylor. MicroStrategy began acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020, and its aggressive accumulation strategy has since made it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. Their strategy was rooted in the belief that Bitcoin is a superior asset for treasury reserves compared to cash, which was losing value due to inflation. MicroStrategy’s bold bet has served as a powerful case study for other companies contemplating corporate Bitcoin adoption . Their success, despite market fluctuations, has demonstrated that it’s possible for a public company to successfully integrate Bitcoin into its financial strategy. While not every company will adopt the same aggressive stance, MicroStrategy’s blueprint has undoubtedly normalized the idea of holding Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets, providing a framework for others to follow. Here’s a quick comparison of the motivations driving MicroStrategy and now Volcon: Aspect MicroStrategy’s Approach Volcon’s Approach (Apparent) Primary Goal Long-term hedge against inflation; maximize shareholder value through Bitcoin appreciation.

BitcoinWorld Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Volcon’s Astonishing $375 Million Bet Signals a New Era In a move that has sent ripples across both the traditional financial markets and the burgeoning cryptocurrency world, Volcon, a Nasdaq-listed all-electric power sports company, has significantly ramped up its digital asset portfolio. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a profound statement on the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption , signaling a deepening institutional embrace of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. For many, this development underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role from a speculative asset to a legitimate treasury reserve. Volcon’s Astonishing Leap into Bitcoin Holdings The news broke with considerable excitement: Volcon announced a substantial purchase of 2,903 Bitcoin (BTC), dramatically increasing its total holdings to an impressive 3,183 BTC. According to reports from prominent crypto observers like @btcNLNico on X, these holdings are now valued at approximately $375 million. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic pivot that positions Volcon among a growing cohort of publicly traded companies diversifying their balance sheets with digital gold. For a company primarily known for its innovative electric motorcycles and off-road vehicles, this move into the volatile realm of cryptocurrency might seem unexpected to some. However, it aligns with a broader macroeconomic narrative that has seen corporations explore alternative asset classes to hedge against inflation, seek growth opportunities, and appeal to a new generation of tech-savvy investors. Volcon’s decision to accumulate such a significant amount of Bitcoin is a testament to the increasing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential as a store of value. Why Are Companies Embracing Corporate Bitcoin Adoption? The question on many minds is, why are more and more corporations, like Volcon, choosing to allocate significant capital to Bitcoin? The reasons are multifaceted, blending macroeconomic trends with a forward-looking vision of financial strategy. Here are some key drivers behind the surge in corporate Bitcoin adoption : Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, traditional fiat currencies are experiencing a decline in purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its capped supply of 21 million coins, is seen by many as a superior inflation hedge, akin to digital gold. Diversification of Treasury Reserves: Companies are looking beyond traditional cash and bond holdings to diversify their treasury reserves. Bitcoin offers a non-correlated asset that can potentially enhance overall portfolio returns and reduce reliance on volatile fiat currencies. Growth Opportunity: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically outperformed most traditional assets over the long term. Companies view Bitcoin as a high-growth asset that can significantly appreciate in value, boosting their balance sheets and shareholder value. Technological Innovation and Future-Proofing: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with the cutting edge of financial technology. It signals an embrace of innovation and a readiness to participate in the evolving digital economy, potentially attracting tech-focused talent and investors. Investor Appeal: For many investors, particularly younger demographics, a company’s embrace of Bitcoin can be a significant draw. It demonstrates a progressive mindset and an understanding of emerging asset classes, potentially increasing stock appeal and valuation. The MicroStrategy Blueprint: Paving the Way for Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Volcon’s move is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a trend largely pioneered by MicroStrategy, led by its outspoken CEO Michael Saylor. MicroStrategy began acquiring Bitcoin in August 2020, and its aggressive accumulation strategy has since made it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. Their strategy was rooted in the belief that Bitcoin is a superior asset for treasury reserves compared to cash, which was losing value due to inflation. MicroStrategy’s bold bet has served as a powerful case study for other companies contemplating corporate Bitcoin adoption . Their success, despite market fluctuations, has demonstrated that it’s possible for a public company to successfully integrate Bitcoin into its financial strategy. While not every company will adopt the same aggressive stance, MicroStrategy’s blueprint has undoubtedly normalized the idea of holding Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets, providing a framework for others to follow. Here’s a quick comparison of the motivations driving MicroStrategy and now Volcon: Aspect MicroStrategy’s Approach Volcon’s Approach (Apparent) Primary Goal Long-term hedge against inflation; maximize shareholder value through Bitcoin appreciation.

This is mostly because bitcoin has started to lose traction. Recall that the primary cryptocurrency skyrocketed to a new all-time high at the beginning of last week when it briefly exceeded $123,000. While that was spectacular on its own, it didn’t last long, and the asset retraced almost immediately by seven grand. What followed for the next ten days or so was sideways trading. BTC remained confined in a relatively tight range between $117,000 and $120,000 as each attempt for a breakout was met with a forceful rejection. The most violent one took place in the past day. Following reports that Galaxy Digital has started to dispose of its assets by offloading $1.5 billion worth of BTC, the cryptocurrency’s price tumbled and slipped below $115,000 for the first time in two weeks. Although it has recovered some ground, it’s still struggling to reclaim $116,000 as of press time, and it’s down by over 2.5% on a weekly scale. At the same time, many altcoins, such as LTC, ENA, and CRO, have produced mindblowing gains within the same timeframe. Binance Coin, on the other hand, shot up to a fresh ATH at over $800 before retracing slightly. Ethereum is also in the green since this time last week. Perhaps driven by the substantial inflows in the spot Ethereum ETFs, the largest altcoin blasted to $3,850 earlier this week. It has lost some ground, but it’s still 1.2% up weekly and now sits close to $3,700.

2025-07-25 14:46:07+00:00,"YBIT: ~46% Distribution Yield, But Peer Looks Better","Summary YBIT offers high income via call writing on Bitcoin exposure, but the usual caveat exists with capped upside potential if Bitcoin rallies strongly. We covered BTCI recently, and we made several comparisons between the two, where BTCI looks like the stronger fund. YBIT''s monthly distributions are attractive for income-focused investors, but they can be quite volatile, similar to the underlying asset. Written by Nick Ackerman, co-produced by Stanford Chemist We recently covered the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ), which gives investors a fairly straightforward strategy of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) exposure while also writing call options to generate ''high income.'' However, that isn''t the only ETF in the space, and another one of the competitors out there is the YieldMax Bitcoin Option Income Strategy ETF ( YBIT ) . This is a fund sponsor that focuses specifically on generating ''yield'' for income-focused investors, as its name would suggest. Given our recent dive into BTCI, we''ll be making many comparisons between the two funds. YBIT Basics Dividend Frequency: Monthly Dividend Yield: 1.54% SEC yield, 45.72% Distribution Yield Expense Ratio: 0.99% Leverage: N/A Managed Assets: $152.63 million Structure: Active ETF YBIT''s investment objective is ""to seek current income."" They also have the secondary investment objective to ""seek exposure to the share price of the Bitcoin ETPs, subject to a limit on potential investment gains."" The fund will seek to achieve this through ""a synthetic covered call strategy on one or more select U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETPs."" YBIT''s Portfolio YBIT is fairly straightforward and quite similar to BTCI, which we covered previously. They provide exposure to BTC primarily through another ETF. For BTCI, they hold a sizeable stake in VanEck Bitcoin ETF ( HODL ), but they also have synthetic exposure through purchasing call options and selling put options. YBIT is long the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) with a sizeable stake, and then the written call contracts. Further, both also have other cash and cash-equivalent positions through U.S. Treasuries. Within their prospectus , the fund also states that the fund can use a synthetic covered call strategy. 1. Synthetic Long Exposure To achieve a synthetic long exposure to each Underlying ETP, the Fund will buy call options on each Underlying ETP and, simultaneously, sell put options on each Underlying ETP to try to replicate the price movements of the Underlying ETP. The call options purchased by the Fund and the put options sold by the Fund will generally have one-month to one-year terms and strike prices that are approximately equal to the then-current share price of their corresponding Underlying ETP at the time the contracts are purchased and sold, respectively. The combination of the long call options and sold put options provides the Fund with investment exposure equal to approximately 100% of their corresponding Underlying ETP for the duration of the applicable options exposure. In addition to employing its synthetic options strategies described above, the Fund may achieve similar indirect exposure to each Underlying ETP by purchasing deep in-the-money ((ITM)) call options. Deep ITM call options have strike prices significantly below the current share price of the corresponding Underlying ETP, allowing the Fund to replicate the price movements of the Underlying ETP with minimal intrinsic value risk. The deep ITM call option approach may serve as an alternative to the synthetic long strategy or may be used in conjunction with it, depending on market conditions and the Adviser’s discretion. However, the latest holdings don''t reflect that they are employing the strategy through an options approach, but simply through IBIT. YBIT Holdings (YieldMax) When looking at YBIT, the expense ratio for the fund is 0.99%. Since more than half of the underlying portfolio is another ETF, considering the IBIT expense ratio can be important too, which comes in at 0.25%. For some context, BTCI''s expense ratio comes to 0.98% with HODL''s expense ratio being waived through January 10, 2026. However, there is some fine print; if the ETF garners over $2.5 billion AUM before that date, the fund will see assets above that level charged 0.20%. Post that waiver date, all assets will see a 0.20% expense ratio. With that said, it would favor BTCI currently on the expense front. In addition, that is particularly true because HODL comes to around 25% of BTCI''s exposure. So that is something to consider if trying to decide between the two. High ''Yield'' From Options The written option contracts will help to generate the ''income'' via the collection of option premiums. Since BTC is quite volatile, the underlying options on the CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index (MBTX) comes with relatively high implied volatility—at least when compared to something like the broader equity market as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ).

The call options purchased by the Fund and the put options sold by the Fund will generally have one-month to one-year terms and strike prices that are approximately equal to the then-current share price of their corresponding Underlying ETP at the time the contracts are purchased and sold, respectively. The combination of the long call options and sold put options provides the Fund with investment exposure equal to approximately 100% of their corresponding Underlying ETP for the duration of the applicable options exposure. In addition to employing its synthetic options strategies described above, the Fund may achieve similar indirect exposure to each Underlying ETP by purchasing deep in-the-money ((ITM)) call options. Deep ITM call options have strike prices significantly below the current share price of the corresponding Underlying ETP, allowing the Fund to replicate the price movements of the Underlying ETP with minimal intrinsic value risk. The deep ITM call option approach may serve as an alternative to the synthetic long strategy or may be used in conjunction with it, depending on market conditions and the Adviser’s discretion. However, the latest holdings don''t reflect that they are employing the strategy through an options approach, but simply through IBIT. YBIT Holdings (YieldMax) When looking at YBIT, the expense ratio for the fund is 0.99%. Since more than half of the underlying portfolio is another ETF, considering the IBIT expense ratio can be important too, which comes in at 0.25%. For some context, BTCI''s expense ratio comes to 0.98% with HODL''s expense ratio being waived through January 10, 2026. However, there is some fine print; if the ETF garners over $2.5 billion AUM before that date, the fund will see assets above that level charged 0.20%. Post that waiver date, all assets will see a 0.20% expense ratio. With that said, it would favor BTCI currently on the expense front. In addition, that is particularly true because HODL comes to around 25% of BTCI''s exposure. So that is something to consider if trying to decide between the two. High ''Yield'' From Options The written option contracts will help to generate the ''income'' via the collection of option premiums. Since BTC is quite volatile, the underlying options on the CBOE Mini Bitcoin U.S. ETF Index (MBTX) comes with relatively high implied volatility—at least when compared to something like the broader equity market as measured by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF ( SPY ). When we looked at BTCI, it was"

2025-07-25 14:50:10+00:00,Strategy''s Stretch (STRC) preferred stock hits markets at $90 pricing,"Strategy announced the upcoming placement of its Stretch (STRC) preferred shares. The offer will be priced at $90, expected to close on July 29. Strategy (MSTR) announced the extension of its preferred share program. Stretch (STRC) will be priced at $90, with the sale round expected to close on July 29. The price is at the bottom of the range where the firm intended to sell at a face value of $100. The placement announcement adds to the final features of STRC after the initial announcement. Strategy is preparing to place 28,011,111 shares at a public offering price of $90 per share. The company expects to raise $2.474B after commissions and fees. The higher amount of shares were announced after the STRC product was oversubscribed. The final offer surpasses even the corrected raise of $2B announced earlier this week. As with other preferred stock offerings, the proceeds of STRC will go toward acquiring more BTC and for the company’s working capital. At the current sale rate, STRC may help add between 17,000 and 21,000 BTC, depending on the market price. The raise is higher than the initially announced $500M , potentially showing heightened interest for new types of Strategy assets. The sale of STRC arrives after Strategy announced two weekly rounds of BTC acquisition financed solely with preferred shares. While the preferred shares may be riskier, this also prevents further dilution from MSTR issues. STRC to offer cumulative dividends STRC will accumulate dividends at a variable rate, and dividends will be payable when authorized by Strategy’s board. The initial monthly regular dividend will be at 9% annualized, but the rate may be adjusted at Strategy’s discretion. STRC issuance will be variable, aiming to maintain a $100 peg. To achieve this, Strategy will adjust the dividend rate, issue more STRC at $101, recall shares, or turn off the sale program under $99. STRC will be one of the most responsive products for Strategy, immediately reflecting demand and market conditions. The new instrument is issued as shares, but behaves like a passive income bond. During favorable times, Strategy can force a repurchase of STRC. During unfavorable BTC price periods, holders can sell back their shares at face value. The STRC dividend rate can be adjusted monthly, but by no more than 0.25% up or down. STRC is thus an instrument to pump cash into BTC, while behaving like a short-term fixed income instrument. The potential for yield and stability may make STRC appealing to mainstream retail investors. The STRC dividends will be paid out in cash, another feature that emulates short-term bonds. MSTR holds above $400 Despite the recent slide in BTC, MSTR shares still traded above $406. STRK preferred shares hovered around 111, STRF traded at $112, and STRD was at $0.87. The preferred shares gained support from a series of private placements, as well as general demand. STRC is not backed by the underlying BTC, which is reserved for only some of Strategy’s investors. Despite the instrument, Strategy’s approach works only if its market activities cause hype and more upside for BTC. The new STRC shares will be senior to STRK and STRD, as well as MSTR common stock, but junior to STRF and convertible bonds from previous rounds. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

RLUSD ranked as the most regulated stablecoin, putting it ahead of Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. Ripple’s RLUSD Ranks As Number One Over USDT and USDC In an X post , Brad Garlinghouse noted that amid the “regulatory goodness” with the GENIUS Act signing last week, Ripple’s stablecoin has been ranked as the number one most trusted stablecoin in the market. This was in reference to stablecoin rating agency Bluechip’s latest ranking, which placed RLUSD as number one, above USDT and USDC. In an X post , the agency revealed that the Ripple stablecoin has become the number one-ranked stablecoin and that it is beginning coverage for RLUSD with an initial rating of A. Bluechip further noted that this development reflects their view that RLUSD is one of the safest stablecoins available. As for the reasons for the A rating, Bluechip noted that Ripple’s stablecoin is backed by U.S. Treasury bills, money market funds, and bank deposits, assets that present some of the lowest credit and duration risks. Furthermore, they stated that RLUSD is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which subjects the stablecoin to stringent regulatory standards. Furthermore, Ripple’s RLUSD reserves are held by the Bank of New York Mellon , the largest custodian of financial securities in the world. As such, this further boosts the stablecoin’s credibility. Bluechip noted that these RLUSD reserves are held in segregated accounts for the benefit of token holders. That way, these assets are protected even if Ripple were to go bankrupt. BlueChip gave the Ripple stablecoin an A rating based on three factors: stability, management, and governance. The stablecoin has a score of 0.91, 0.84, and 0.86, respectively. The assessment based on these scores means that the stablecoin is stable, while the management and governance are “very low risk.” Where USDT And USDC Rank Circle’s USDC ranks at eight, way below the Ripple stablecoin. USDC currently boasts a B+ ranking despite being the second-largest stablecoin by market cap. Interestingly, Circle and Ripple have both applied for a national banking license , which would enable them to custody the reserves for their respective stablecoins. This would also boost the regulatory standing of the RLUSD and USDC stablecoins as they will now be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). Meanwhile, Tether’s USDT is ranked as 16th on Bluechip’s ranking with a D rating, indicating a lack of confidence in the stablecoin’s regulatory standard.

2025-07-25 15:00:54+00:00,"Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000","BitMEX co-founder and crypto investor, Arthur Hayes, has outlined the key catalysts that could drive the Ethereum price to a $10,000 all-time high by year-end. In a detailed market analysis, Hayes explains how expanding US credit policies, growing institutional interests, and a shift toward wartime economic strategies could create the ideal conditions for a major ETH price rally. Ethereum Price Set To Hit $10,000 By Year End On July 23, Hayes published an in-depth report on Substack, analyzing geopolitical trends and how they could create the ideal conditions for a major Ethereum price surge. The crypto founder has set a bold target of $10,000 for ETH by the end of 2025, attributing the future rally to macroeconomic shifts and increasing institutional appetite. Related Reading: This Ethereum Descending Broadening Wedge Pattern Looks Similar To 2019-2020, Here’s What Happened Last Time Hayes believes that as the US leans further into wartime economic policies under President Donald Trump’s reign, a wave of credit expansion could be unleashed—fueling “asset bubbles,” particularly in crypto. According to the BitMEX co-founder, Ethereum could benefit most from this environment. While Bitcoin remains the crypto reserve asset, Hayes notes that ETH has been largely overlooked since Solana’s explosive rebound post-FTX. However, he asserts that the tides are turning, especially among Western institutional investors who are starting to favor Ethereum-based assets. The crypto founder pointed to growing confidence in Ethereum from financial influencers like Tom Lee and a renewed interest in DeFi ecosystems as early signs of a potential breakout. Hayes’ venture capital firm, Maelstrom, is now also fully committed to ETH and the broader ERC-20 ecosystem. He has declared that the next ”Ether bull run” is imminent, forecasting a 176.3% rise from ETH’s current price of $3,619. Alongside his $10,000 Ethereum target, the crypto founder projected that Bitcoin could skyrocket to $250,000 before the end of the year. ETH Rally Tied To US Economic And Wartime Developments In his report, Hayes seemingly connects Ethereum’s upside potential to a broader macroeconomic narrative rooted in fiscal policy and geopolitical conflict. He argues that the US is shifting toward a form of state-sponsored capitalism or economic fascism designed to fuel wartime production. Related Reading: Ethereum ATH Above $4,800? Here’s How High It Will Go If 2021 Repeats According to the crypto founder, this strategy encourages banks to lend freely to companies without government-guaranteed profits. He noted that when the fiat supply increases without a corresponding rise in raw materials or labor, inflation becomes unavoidable. To manage this, he suggests the government may need to blow bubbles in non-essential assets like crypto, to absorb excess credit without destabilizing essentials like food or housing. Furthermore, Hayes believes that just as Ethereum stands to benefit from this environment, stablecoins may play a key role in building it. As the crypto market cap grows, so does the amount stored in stablecoins, most of which are reinvested into US Treasury bills. For instance, if the market cap of crypto hits $100 trillion by 2026, the BitMEX co-founder predicts that stablecoins could indirectly fund trillions in government debt, ultimately making crypto an integral player in sustaining wartime fiscal policies.

2025-07-25 15:02:02+00:00,Forbes draws criticism from Ripple CTO and crypto KOLs over ''nonsense'' SBF defense,"Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz has pushed back against a Forbes article defending Sam Bankman-Fried, calling the argument “nonsense.” The article called the convicted FTX founder a sufficiently villainized innovator who had sought to lead the larger effort to codify crypto regulation. One of the arguments of the Forbes article was the reclassification of the native FTT token of FTX . The article asserted that FTT was not like a stablecoin but closer to equity since holders can access a share in FTX’s revenues. It claimed that customers were not depositing money but investing speculatively in SBF himself. Schwartz protested this assumption. He stated that laying out the fraud as speculation neglects the main issue, which is the uncertainty of whether client money was misappropriated without their consent. The Ripple executive stressed that re-purposing assets on the books, as customers without disclosing what happens to a token, is an affront to fundamental legal and ethical foundations. The Forbes article went on to project that without the ill-advised and now illegal financial actions by Bankman-Fried, FTX would not have gained investor confidence to start with. Schwartz opposed this by stating that confidence based on unauthorized fund transfers cannot change it to legitimacy. Misplaced heroism and the question of accountability The article portrayed SBF as a progressive individual who enjoys respect because of lobbying in Washington. It attributed his influence to laws like the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts, the latter of which it considered an indication of him looking to legitimize crypto. It also speculated on whether President Donald Trump could pardon SBF because of his visionary impulse. “Which brings us to GENIUS, CLARITY, and other Acts meant to create a stable regulatory environment for the cryptocurrency present and future. The latter precisely explains why SBF was spending so much time in Washington.” ~ Forbes Forbes went further and placed SBF’s conviction into the context of a necessary market correction as opposed to a careful brush against US laws. It also asked whether he was really committing crimes or if he was just taking welcome business chances that went wrong. However, Schwartz maintained that innovation should work within the laws and that failure should not be equated with fraud; otherwise, it would lower the whole industry’s reputation. Industry observers strongly reject Forbes’ narrative Coin Center’s Neeraj Agrawal shared the article on X, prompting immediate backlash and comments asking for clarification about why the Forbes article de-emphasized the gravity of SBF’s actions, and presenting his regulatory goals as if it did not have any consequences. The article elicited immediate counteraction from the crypto community. According to the editor of The Block, Tim Copeland, it was so “absurd” that he had to deconstruct it point by point.

2025-07-25 15:10:10+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Plunge: What Shocked BTC Below $115,000?","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Plunge: What Shocked BTC Below $115,000? The cryptocurrency market, known for its thrilling highs and sudden lows, has once again captured headlines. This time, the focus is on a significant shift in the Bitcoin price , as the world’s leading cryptocurrency dipped below the crucial $115,000 mark. For many, this unexpected drop raises questions about market stability and future trajectories. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or new to the crypto space, understanding the dynamics behind such movements is essential. Let’s delve into what caused this latest dip and what it might mean for the broader digital asset landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Movement According to real-time market monitoring, the Bitcoin price experienced a notable decline, trading at $114,940.5 on the Binance USDT market. This particular figure isn’t just a number; it represents a significant psychological and technical level for many traders and investors. The fall below $115,000 marks a shift in market sentiment, potentially signaling increased caution or even a temporary bearish trend. Such price fluctuations are not uncommon in the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, while often seen as a store of value, is still subject to rapid changes driven by a multitude of factors. When the Bitcoin price takes a dip, it often creates ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem, affecting altcoins and overall market capitalization. Understanding the immediate context of this drop involves looking at: Liquidity Pools: How much BTC is available for trading and how quickly can it be bought or sold without significantly affecting its price. Trading Volume: High volume during a price drop can indicate strong selling pressure. Order Book Dynamics: The balance between buy and sell orders at various price levels. This particular movement, observed across major exchanges like Binance, underscores the interconnectedness of global crypto markets and the rapid dissemination of trading activity. What Factors Influence Bitcoin Price Volatility? The cryptocurrency market is a complex interplay of global events, investor psychology, and technological advancements. When the Bitcoin price experiences a sharp movement like the recent dip below $115,000, it’s rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s often a confluence of several contributing factors. Let’s explore some of the key influences that drive Bitcoin’s inherent volatility: Macroeconomic Trends and Global Economy The health of the global economy plays a significant role in how investors perceive risk assets, including Bitcoin. Factors such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, and the overall economic outlook can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, moving away from volatile assets like crypto. For instance, if traditional markets show signs of instability, capital might flow out of Bitcoin, impacting its price. Regulatory News and Government Policies Government regulations, or even rumors of impending regulations, can have an immediate and profound impact on the Bitcoin price . Positive news, like a country adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, can boost confidence, while negative news, such as outright bans or stricter taxation, can trigger sell-offs. The uncertainty surrounding regulatory frameworks in major economies often contributes to price swings. Whale Movements and Institutional Adoption Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence market dynamics. A single large sell order from a whale can create downward pressure, triggering a cascade of selling from smaller investors. Conversely, increased institutional adoption, such as major companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets or launching crypto-related financial products, tends to provide long-term support and stability to the Bitcoin price . Market Sentiment and the Fear & Greed Index Investor psychology is a powerful force. Tools like the Crypto Fear & Greed Index attempt to quantify this sentiment. When the market is overly greedy, it can lead to speculative bubbles, while extreme fear can trigger panic selling. A sudden shift in collective sentiment, perhaps due to a piece of news or a technical breakdown, can rapidly alter the Bitcoin price trajectory. Technological Developments and Network Upgrades While less frequent, significant upgrades or changes to Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology can also influence its price. Events like the Bitcoin halving, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin, are historically bullish. Conversely, any perceived vulnerabilities or delays in crucial developments could temporarily dampen enthusiasm and impact the Bitcoin price . Is This Bitcoin Price Drop a Cause for Alarm or Opportunity? When the Bitcoin price dips, the immediate reaction for many is often fear.

2025-07-25 15:10:37+00:00,How can BitVMX Watchtowers Help Improve the Lightning Network?,"Watchtowers are specialised services in the Bitcoin Lightning Network that protect users from fraud by monitoring the blockchain and intervening if an outdated channel state is maliciously broadcast. Their importance lies in safeguarding users who may be offline or unable to respond to disputes in real-time, a key vulnerability in Lightning’s off-chain payment model. However, traditional watchtower designs often rely on centralised, trusted parties, which introduces censorship and privacy concerns. BitVMX introduces a new solution to this problem by enabling watchtowers to act as programmable, verifiable agents. Their behaviour can be enforced through fraud proofs, significantly reducing the trust required in any single operator. Unlike past models, BitVMX watchtowers are transparent, auditable, and resistant to misbehaviour, addressing the oracle problem in a narrowly defined and enforceable way. This innovation has the potential to strengthen the security and decentralisation of the Lightning Network and is critical to making it viable for widespread, mobile-first adoption . What are Watchtowers and Why Do They Matter? Watchtowers are specialised services in the Bitcoin Lightning Network designed to monitor the blockchain on behalf of users and take action if a counterparty attempts to cheat by broadcasting an outdated channel state. Since the Lightning Network relies on off-chain payment channels, both parties must maintain an accurate and up-to-date view of their shared channel balance. In the event of a dispute, the correct state is enforced by publishing the latest commitment transaction on-chain. However, if one party is offline or unavailable when the other broadcasts an old, favourable state, they risk losing funds. Watchtowers act as an outsourced guardian, constantly scanning the blockchain and broadcasting a penalty transaction if they detect fraudulent activity. The need for watchtowers arises from the inherent security trade-off in Lightning’s design. Users gain speed and privacy by settling transactions off-chain, but they must remain intermittently online to defend against channel breaches. This requirement is impractical for most users, especially those on mobile or intermittently connected devices. Watchtowers allow users to delegate this responsibility while retaining security guarantees. Over the past few years, several implementations of watchtowers, such as those in LND , C-Lightning , and Electrum , have shown that the concept is technically viable. However, most current watchtowers are centralised or operated by trusted third parties, raising concerns about censorship, availability, and reliance on specific providers. The push for decentralised watchtowers presents a complex set of challenges. In order to be effective without creating trust dependencies, watchtowers must be incentivised to act honestly, while simultaneously not being able to learn private user information. This is complicated by the so-called “ oracle problem ” in blockchain systems: when smart contracts or off-chain systems require real-world data (or in this case, off-chain monitoring), they must trust an external entity to report it correctly. Watchtowers are a form of oracle, albeit with a narrow role, reporting on-chain activity relevant to specific Lightning channels. The challenge is to design a system where users can trust that a watchtower will respond correctly to fraud, without having to trust the watchtower in a general sense or expose sensitive information to it. Without effective watchtower infrastructure, users are exposed to potentially irreversible losses during offline periods, particularly in low-liquidity or adversarial environments. As the Lightning Network aims for broader adoption, particularly among mobile users and merchants who cannot be constantly online, watchtowers become an essential layer for usability and trust. Their role is not only defensive but enabling, as they abstract away complex vigilance requirements and make Lightning accessible to less technical users. Building a decentralised, incentive-compatible, and privacy-preserving watchtower system remains a critical goal for Lightning’s long-term scalability and resilience, and its success will likely determine whether the network can mature into a truly global, always-available layer for Bitcoin payments. What Does BitVMX Bring to the Table in Terms of Watchtowers? BitVMX is an advanced framework, built on the Rootstock (RSK) sidechain for Bitcoin, focused on enabling general-purpose, off-chain computation on Bitcoin that can be enforced on-chain using interactive fraud proofs. Building on the principles of the original BitVM concept, BitVMX allows participants to run complex programs off-chain and commit to their outcomes in a way that can be verified and disputed on the Bitcoin blockchain if needed.

2025-07-25 15:17:57+00:00,"Crypto Price Analysis 7-25: BITCOIN: BTC, ETHEREUM: ETH, SOLANA: SOL, NEAR PROTOCOL: NEAR, CHAINLINK: LINK","The crypto market registered a sharp decline over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies traded in bearish territory. BTC, which traded above the $119,000 mark, lost momentum and plunged to an intraday low of $114,798 before recovering and moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2%, trading around $116,500. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has had an eventful 24 hours. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $3,768 on Thursday before dropping to a low of $3,586. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $3,700 and move to its current level of $3,731. Ripple (XRP) is also trading in positive territory, with the price up nearly 1%, trading around $3.13. Solana (SOL) is down over 2%, trading around $181, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 2% at $0.232. Cardano (ADA) is trading in positive territory, up over 1%, while Stellar (XLM) is up almost 1%, trading around $0.424. Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. Christie Debuts Crypto-Only Real Estate Team UK auction house Christie''s has created a team dedicated to facilitating the use of crypto to complete real estate transactions. The move is the firm’s latest expansion of its digital asset offerings. The division, called Christie’s International Real Estate, offers customers a team of lawyers, analysts, and crypto experts to facilitate property transactions involving crypto. Christie’s International Real Estate CEO Aaron Kirman revealed that he opened the service after Christie''s began making large real estate deals involving crypto, with one deal worth $65 million. The division is Christie’s latest crypto offering, with the firm having dabbled in crypto earlier as well, offering auctions for NFTs and crypto. The auction house reported $5.7 billion in sales last year, a 6% fall compared to 2023. Christie''s reportedly has over $1 billion in real estate on offer, where sellers are open to accepting crypto as payment. Chris Hanley, owner of a home up for sale in Joshua Tree, stated, “Accepting cryptocurrency signals an openness to innovative buyers, some of whom are crypto millionaires and billionaires looking for real-world assets to diversify.” Crypto Liquidations Nearing $1 Billion The crypto derivatives market saw significant liquidation events, with Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) registering substantial losses. According to CoinGlass, the crypto derivatives sector was hit by a wave of liquidations over the past 24 hours, with over $950 million in derivatives contracts liquidated. An overwhelming majority of positions were long positions, with bullish positions staring at $829 million worth of liquidations. However, Bitcoin (BTC) has not been impacted by the ongoing liquidations, suggesting that the drop could be a result of investors rotating capital out of altcoins. XRP fell 12% in 24 hours, dropping in tandem with the broader crypto market, which recorded a 3% decline. Analysts blamed cascading liquidations and a drop in liquidity as the reason behind XRP’s sudden decline, as over-leveraged long positions were liquidated across the market. ETH Core Developer Testifies In Roman Storm Case The Roman Storm trial continued as prosecutors rested their case, allowing the defense counsel to call an Ethereum developer as its first witness. According to media reports, Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon testified in the case, reportedly describing Tornado Cash as a privacy tool for Ethereum. He added that he had used the mixing service four times to send ETH. Loon cited safety concerns, stating, “If [hackers] know the scope of my assets, I can become a target.” Loon’s cross-examination was limited to questions about whether he knew Storme personally or if he had used a normal crypto platform like Coinbase. Hong Kong To Criminalise Unlicensed Stablecoin Promotions Hong Kong will begin enforcing its Stablecoin Ordinance from August 1, making it illegal to offer or promote unlicensed stablecoins to retail investors.

The crypto market registered a sharp decline over the past 24 hours as Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies traded in bearish territory. BTC, which traded above the $119,000 mark, lost momentum and plunged to an intraday low of $114,798 before recovering and moving to its current level. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2%, trading around $116,500. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) has had an eventful 24 hours. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $3,768 on Thursday before dropping to a low of $3,586. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $3,700 and move to its current level of $3,731. Ripple (XRP) is also trading in positive territory, with the price up nearly 1%, trading around $3.13. Solana (SOL) is down over 2%, trading around $181, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 2% at $0.232. Cardano (ADA) is trading in positive territory, up over 1%, while Stellar (XLM) is up almost 1%, trading around $0.424. Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC) , Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered notable increases. Christie Debuts Crypto-Only Real Estate Team UK auction house Christie''s has created a team dedicated to facilitating the use of crypto to complete real estate transactions. The move is the firm’s latest expansion of its digital asset offerings. The division, called Christie’s International Real Estate, offers customers a team of lawyers, analysts, and crypto experts to facilitate property transactions involving crypto. Christie’s International Real Estate CEO Aaron Kirman revealed that he opened the service after Christie''s began making large real estate deals involving crypto, with one deal worth $65 million. The division is Christie’s latest crypto offering, with the firm having dabbled in crypto earlier as well, offering auctions for NFTs and crypto. The auction house reported $5.7 billion in sales last year, a 6% fall compared to 2023. Christie''s reportedly has over $1 billion in real estate on offer, where sellers are open to accepting crypto as payment. Chris Hanley, owner of a home up for sale in Joshua Tree, stated, “Accepting cryptocurrency signals an openness to innovative buyers, some of whom are crypto millionaires and billionaires looking for real-world assets to diversify.” Crypto Liquidations Nearing $1 Billion The crypto derivatives market saw significant liquidation events, with Ripple (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) registering substantial losses. According to CoinGlass, the crypto derivatives sector was hit by a wave of liquidations over the past 24 hours, with over $950 million in derivatives contracts liquidated. An overwhelming majority of positions were long positions, with bullish positions staring at $829 million worth of liquidations. However, Bitcoin (BTC) has not been impacted by the ongoing liquidations, suggesting that the drop could be a result of investors rotating capital out of altcoins. XRP fell 12% in 24 hours, dropping in tandem with the broader crypto market, which recorded a 3% decline. Analysts blamed cascading liquidations and a drop in liquidity as the reason behind XRP’s sudden decline, as over-leveraged long positions were liquidated across the market. ETH Core Developer Testifies In Roman Storm Case The Roman Storm trial continued as prosecutors rested their case, allowing the defense counsel to call an Ethereum developer as its first witness. According to media reports, Ethereum core developer Preston Van Loon testified in the case, reportedly describing Tornado Cash as a privacy tool for Ethereum.

ETH is now up by 23% in a fortnight and by 53% in the last 30 days, while it also boasts a 17% increase in the past year. This latter percentage is fairly modest in comparison with other major tokens, but ETF inflows suggests that demand is steadily rising for the altcoin.

It remains 24% below its ATH of $4,878, which it set back in November 2021, while it had remained below $3,000 for the entire period between February 3 and July 14. As such, there’s still a case that it could rise considerably further before becoming overbought, with its chart today showing that it continues to maintain strong momentum.

Source: TradingView The same thing applies to the coin’s MACD (orange, blue), which is still at its highest position since 2021. Now is therefore a very good time to buy ETH, since even if it dips a little over the weekend, its medium-term trajectory remains upwards. As we’ve written before, Ethereum’s TVL accounts for 59.5% of the entire crypto sector , and that’s not including Ethereum-based layer-two networks. Given Ethereum’s network effects and its ongoing development, this dominance is likely to remain, which would point towards a much higher price longer term. The Ethereum price could therefore reach $4,000 by the end of August, before ending the year at around $5,000. And if it continues to attract more investment and adoption, $50,000 could be a realistic target over the next few years.

2025-07-25 15:23:09+00:00,Crypto Finance Firm Matrixport Says Bitcoin May Be Entering a Summer Seasonal Correction Phase! Here Are the Details,"Crypto finance firm Matrixport stated in its latest report dated July 25 that Bitcoin may have entered a seasonal correction phase typical of the summer months. Matrixport: Bitcoin Entering a Seasonal Correction, Is This a Buying Opportunity? According to the report, while Bitcoin''s upside potential emerged after breaking above the key $109,410 level on July 4, technical signals in recent days suggest an increased risk of short-term declines. In its latest analysis, Matrixport pointed out that the corporate buying season has ended and the market is slowly turning towards profit realization. The “Genius” Bill and the Impact of US Policies Matrixport also evaluated the US government''s “GENIUS” bill, which could open a new page in digital asset regulations. This bill was described as a comprehensive economic strategy aimed at promoting a digital dollar, supporting Treasury bonds, and paving the way for a blockchain-based financial system. This development was interpreted as a signal that the US is preparing to adopt a more constructive stance in the crypto space. The report noted that investors are becoming more cautious as the second half of the summer approaches, and position reductions may accelerate. The report predicts that some large investors, in particular, may resort to profit-taking, which could put pressure on the market and lead to a gradual decline in Bitcoin''s price throughout the summer. According to Matrixport, Bitcoin''s struggle to break above $122,000 constitutes technical resistance. The institution noted that both technical indicators and institutional inflows are weakening, leaving a strong element lacking to support upward momentum in the short term. Conclusion: According to Matrixport''s assessment, the market is currently in a correction phase. However, this could also be seen as a buying opportunity for long-term investors. If institutional inflows pick up again, Bitcoin could gain new upward momentum. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-25 15:33:03+00:00,Analysts stoke bubble fears as US stocks trade at records amid meme frenzy and rising debt,"U.S. stocks have surged this summer to levels not seen in years thanks to very low borrowing costs. Yet record valuations, a revival in speculative “meme” trading and a key “euphoria” indicator sitting at bubble‑like levels have many investors uneasy. This month, the S&P 500 reached new all‑time peaks, and U.S. firms are enjoying borrowing rates close to multi‑decade lows. FT reports this turnaround contrasts sharply with the sharp sell‑off in April triggered by President Donald Trump’s threats of escalating trade tariffs. Although Trump moves ahead with import duties at levels not witnessed for a generation, signs of overheating are accumulating. Major technology firms have soared to fresh heights. Nvidia was the first to hit a $4 trillion valuation while a resurgence of last year’s meme‑stock frenzy sees retail traders piling into GoPro and Krispy Kreme expecting rapid returns. “I think you’re beginning to see perhaps some very early parallels to what you saw back with the internet boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s,” said Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at $2.1 trillion asset manager Pimco. “There’s this lottery‑ticket mentality that tends to exist … It’s a dangerous set up.” Markets are settling for less as bad deals beat full-blown trade war According to Bloomberg, the S&P 500 is trading at over 3.3 times annual revenues, marking an unprecedented valuation. Barclays’ so‑called “equity euphoria” index, a composite of derivatives activity, volatility and sentiment, has climbed to twice its typical level, a threshold often associated with bubble conditions. U.S stocks reach record highs. Source LSEG, markets.ft.com “The indicator is clearly showing that the market is euphoric,” said Stefano Pascale, head of U.S. equity derivatives strategy at Barclays. Market participants greeted the U.S.‑Japan trade deal , which sets Japanese import levies at 15% and are now anticipating a similar arrangement with the EU. While these tariffs exceed pre‑Trump levels, they are milder than the dramatic rates warned in his “liberation day” address that had previously jolted equities. “These first deals are bad, but investors are happy with anything but a full trade war,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. Equities have largely ignored worries over ballooning U.S. public debt and potential threats to Federal Reserve independence , factors that have unsettled Treasury yields. The dollar has declined almost 10 percent this year versus a basket of currencies. The rally since April has been propelled by a select group of big tech names. Nvidia’s shares have rebounded by 100%, while Meta has recovered about 49 % from their April intraday depths. Debt surge sparks warnings of dot‑com era Valuation metrics such as price‑to‑sales, price‑to‑cash‑flow, price‑to‑book and price‑to‑dividend ratios across the index are approaching historic peaks. Rob Arnott, founder and chair of Research Affiliates, compared investing in these names to “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.” He warned that the market is valuing leading AI companies as if competition won’t emerge, yet shifting away from these fashionable stocks too soon can be perilous. Even smaller outfits have outperformed the giants. Palantir’s stock , buoyed by substantial government deals, is up about 130% since April, and Coinbase has soared nearly 180% amid renewed enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies since Trump’s win last November. Bitcoin jumped above $120,000 last week as both corporations and investors increasingly embraced cryptocurrencies moving into mainstream finance. This optimistic sentiment has spread to the corporate bond market. The spread on top‑tier corporate debt over U.S. Treasuries has tightened to only 0.8 percentage points, levels not recorded since 2005. In a Thursday note, Deutsche Bank analysts questioned if this debt‑fueled equity buying represented the “ hottest euphoria ” since the late 1990s and mid‑2000s.

Nvidia was the first to hit a $4 trillion valuation while a resurgence of last year’s meme‑stock frenzy sees retail traders piling into GoPro and Krispy Kreme expecting rapid returns. “I think you’re beginning to see perhaps some very early parallels to what you saw back with the internet boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s,” said Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at $2.1 trillion asset manager Pimco. “There’s this lottery‑ticket mentality that tends to exist … It’s a dangerous set up.” Markets are settling for less as bad deals beat full-blown trade war According to Bloomberg, the S&P 500 is trading at over 3.3 times annual revenues, marking an unprecedented valuation. Barclays’ so‑called “equity euphoria” index, a composite of derivatives activity, volatility and sentiment, has climbed to twice its typical level, a threshold often associated with bubble conditions. U.S stocks reach record highs. Source LSEG, markets.ft.com “The indicator is clearly showing that the market is euphoric,” said Stefano Pascale, head of U.S. equity derivatives strategy at Barclays. Market participants greeted the U.S.‑Japan trade deal , which sets Japanese import levies at 15% and are now anticipating a similar arrangement with the EU. While these tariffs exceed pre‑Trump levels, they are milder than the dramatic rates warned in his “liberation day” address that had previously jolted equities. “These first deals are bad, but investors are happy with anything but a full trade war,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. Equities have largely ignored worries over ballooning U.S. public debt and potential threats to Federal Reserve independence , factors that have unsettled Treasury yields. The dollar has declined almost 10 percent this year versus a basket of currencies. The rally since April has been propelled by a select group of big tech names. Nvidia’s shares have rebounded by 100%, while Meta has recovered about 49 % from their April intraday depths. Debt surge sparks warnings of dot‑com era Valuation metrics such as price‑to‑sales, price‑to‑cash‑flow, price‑to‑book and price‑to‑dividend ratios across the index are approaching historic peaks. Rob Arnott, founder and chair of Research Affiliates, compared investing in these names to “picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.” He warned that the market is valuing leading AI companies as if competition won’t emerge, yet shifting away from these fashionable stocks too soon can be perilous. Even smaller outfits have outperformed the giants. Palantir’s stock , buoyed by substantial government deals, is up about 130% since April, and Coinbase has soared nearly 180% amid renewed enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies since Trump’s win last November. Bitcoin jumped above $120,000 last week as both corporations and investors increasingly embraced cryptocurrencies moving into mainstream finance. This optimistic sentiment has spread to the corporate bond market. The spread on top‑tier corporate debt over U.S. Treasuries has tightened to only 0.8 percentage points, levels not recorded since 2005. In a Thursday note, Deutsche Bank analysts questioned if this debt‑fueled equity buying represented the “ hottest euphoria ” since the late 1990s and mid‑2000s.

The price has been moving sideways without any major breakout or breakdown. After a small bounce from last week’s low, many traders are wondering: was that the bottom, or is more downside coming? Over the past week, Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range. It moves up slightly, then drops back down, showing no real commitment in either direction. Some analysts thought the recent dip could have been the final low, but the bounce from there wasn’t strong or convincing enough. The price structure suggests that the market hasn’t made a decision yet. Key Level to Watch: $120,200 For Bitcoin to show real strength, it needs to break above the $120,200 level. So far, that hasn’t happened. The recent rally from last week’s low was weak, and unless Bitcoin climbs above this key level, there’s no confirmation that a new upward trend has started. Bitcoin Dominance Adds More Clues Bitcoin dominance recently bounced from a support zone around 60.2 percent and is now stuck in a resistance area. If dominance rises again, it could mean Bitcoin is gaining strength compared to altcoins, which usually happens when traders move their money back into BTC during uncertain times. What Happens If Bitcoin Drops Again? If Bitcoin creates another local low below last Thursday’s dip, this could increase the chances of a deeper correction. Analysts are watching the $113,800 support level very closely. A drop toward that level wouldn’t break the overall trend just yet, but falling below it might force traders to rethink the current bullish outlook. Still No Clear Signal Right now, Bitcoin remains stuck in a messy range. There are signs of both strength and weakness, but no clear winner.

2025-07-25 15:40:11+00:00,DOJ Dragonfly: Urgent Warning for Crypto VC Firms Amidst Looming Charges,"BitcoinWorld DOJ Dragonfly: Urgent Warning for Crypto VC Firms Amidst Looming Charges The cryptocurrency world is once again abuzz with significant legal developments, as whispers from reputable sources indicate the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is actively considering charges against executives from Dragonfly, a prominent crypto venture capital firm. This news, initially shared by Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, on X, sends a powerful ripple through the digital asset landscape, particularly as the high-profile trial of Tornado Cash founder Roman Storm is set to resume. The potential prosecution of individuals associated with a major investor like Dragonfly, especially given their backing of controversial projects like Tornado Cash, signals an escalating regulatory crackdown and highlights the critical need for vigilance within the crypto industry. For anyone invested in or operating within the crypto space, understanding the nuances of this DOJ Dragonfly development is paramount. What’s Happening with DOJ Dragonfly ? An Unprecedented Scrutiny The core of the recent news revolves around the U.S. Department of Justice’s ongoing deliberations regarding potential charges against executives at Dragonfly. Dragonfly is a well-known venture capital firm that has invested in numerous blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. The specific nature of the charges under consideration has not been fully disclosed, but the connection to Tornado Cash is a significant indicator of the DOJ’s focus. This isn’t just a minor inquiry; it represents a serious escalation in regulatory scrutiny that could redefine the boundaries for crypto investment and operations. Historically, regulatory actions have often targeted projects directly, or individuals involved in illicit activities. However, the prospect of the DOJ Dragonfly pursuing charges against VC firm executives for their investment choices marks a potentially new and impactful precedent. This development underscores a shift in how authorities perceive the responsibility of investors in the crypto ecosystem. It suggests that merely providing capital, especially to projects later deemed problematic, might no longer be seen as a passive act. Instead, it could be interpreted as facilitating or contributing to activities that the DOJ considers unlawful. The implications are far-reaching, prompting venture capitalists and institutional investors to re-evaluate their due diligence processes and risk assessments when backing new crypto ventures. The fact that the news comes from a reputable crypto journalist like Eleanor Terrett lends significant credibility to the ongoing discussions within legal and regulatory circles. The Shadow of Tornado Cash: Why is DOJ Dragonfly Involved? To fully grasp why the DOJ Dragonfly situation is so critical, one must understand its connection to Tornado Cash. Tornado Cash is a cryptocurrency mixer, a decentralized protocol designed to obscure the origins and destinations of crypto transactions. While proponents argue it’s a vital tool for privacy, critics, including global regulators, contend it has been extensively used by bad actors for money laundering, sanctions evasion, and financing illicit activities, including by North Korean state-sponsored hacking groups like Lazarus Group. In August 2022, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Tornado Cash, making it illegal for U.S. persons to use the service. Dragonfly’s involvement stems from its previous investment in and support for Tornado Cash. While the exact nature and extent of this support are subject to ongoing legal scrutiny, the DOJ’s interest indicates a belief that Dragonfly’s executives may bear some responsibility for the alleged illicit uses of the protocol they backed. The timing of this news is also crucial, coinciding with the resumption of the trial of Roman Storm, one of Tornado Cash’s co-founders. Storm faces charges of money laundering and sanctions violations, accused of creating and promoting a service that knowingly facilitated illicit transactions. The outcome of his trial could heavily influence the DOJ’s strategy regarding Dragonfly and other investors in similar privacy-enhancing technologies. The core legal challenge here revolves around the concept of “material support” or “aiding and abetting.” Regulators are increasingly trying to determine if providing financial backing or infrastructure to a project that subsequently facilitates illegal activities constitutes a prosecutable offense, even if the investors did not directly participate in the illicit acts themselves. This legal frontier is particularly complex in the decentralized world of crypto, where traditional lines of responsibility can be blurred.

2025-07-25 15:45:11+00:00,Trump AI Policy: Unveiling the Controversial AI Action Plan for Silicon Valley,"BitcoinWorld Trump AI Policy: Unveiling the Controversial AI Action Plan for Silicon Valley In the rapidly evolving world of technology and digital assets, the intersection of government policy and innovation is paramount. For those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding shifts in broader tech policy, especially regarding Artificial Intelligence, is crucial. President Donald Trump’s recently unveiled AI Action Plan has sent ripples across Silicon Valley, sparking both excitement and concern. But what does this mean for the future of tech, and should Silicon Valley truly be celebrating? What Does Trump’s AI Policy Mean for Tech Giants? The announcement of President Trump’s AI Action Plan has been met with a surprisingly celebratory mood among many large AI companies. This reaction is perhaps less surprising when considering that the plan was reportedly shaped by key Silicon Valley allies of the Trump administration. The core tenets of this new policy aim to significantly reshape the AI landscape. It proposes making it more challenging for environmental regulators to block essential Data Center Construction , reducing the ability of state governments to oversee AI development and safety, and curbing the development of what conservatives often label as “woke” AI. This strategic shift could potentially offer tech giants greater operational freedom, but it also introduces new complexities and ethical considerations. How Will Silicon Valley AI Navigate New Regulatory Waters? For companies at the heart of Silicon Valley AI , these proposed changes present a dual-edged sword. On one hand, the easing of regulatory burdens, particularly concerning environmental permits for infrastructure, could accelerate growth and innovation. Faster deployment of AI technologies might be possible without the perceived red tape. On the other hand, the reduction of state-level oversight could lead to a more centralized, federal approach to AI regulation, potentially bypassing local concerns or unique state-specific needs. The “woke AI” directive, in particular, poses a challenge for companies committed to developing ethical and unbiased AI systems, forcing a reevaluation of their internal development guidelines and content moderation policies. The Bitcoin World’s Equity podcast hosts, Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha, delved deep into these implications, discussing the potential ramifications for the industry’s future direction. Unpacking the AI Action Plan: Key Provisions and Their Impact The specifics of the AI Action Plan reveal several critical areas of impact: Streamlined Data Center Construction: A major focus is on making it harder for environmental regulators to impede the building of new data centers. This is crucial for AI, as these centers are the backbone of computational power required for training and deploying complex AI models. While this could speed up infrastructure development, it raises questions about environmental protection and sustainable growth. Reduced State Government Oversight: The plan seeks to limit the capacity of individual states to oversee AI development and safety. This centralization of power at the federal level could lead to more uniform national standards, but it might also stifle state-led initiatives that are often closer to local societal needs and concerns. Addressing “Woke” AI: A contentious aspect, this provision targets AI systems that conservatives perceive as biased or promoting certain ideologies. This could influence how tech companies design algorithms for fairness, content filtering, and data representation, potentially leading to a reevaluation of ethical AI frameworks within the industry. Boosting Innovation: The Role of Data Center Construction in Trump’s AI Vision A cornerstone of President Trump’s strategy for accelerating AI advancement lies in facilitating Data Center Construction . Recognizing that robust infrastructure is non-negotiable for large-scale AI operations, the plan aims to remove perceived bureaucratic hurdles. By making it more difficult for environmental agencies to block or delay construction projects, the administration hopes to enable a rapid expansion of the computing power necessary for advanced AI research and deployment. While this approach promises to boost innovation and competitiveness in the global AI race, it also ignites debates about balancing technological progress with environmental stewardship. The rapid expansion of these energy-intensive facilities could have significant ecological footprints, a concern for many environmental advocacy groups. The Future of AI Development: Centralized Control or State Autonomy?

2025-07-25 15:55:11+00:00,Massive USDT Transfer: Unpacking the $210 Million Kraken to Bitfinex Shift,"BitcoinWorld Massive USDT Transfer: Unpacking the $210 Million Kraken to Bitfinex Shift The cryptocurrency world is always abuzz with activity, but every so often, a transaction occurs that truly captures attention. Recently, the digital realm witnessed such an event: a Whale Alert report confirming a staggering 210,000,000 USDT transfer from the Kraken exchange to Bitfinex. Valued at approximately $210 million, this massive movement of Tether’s stablecoin has naturally sparked curiosity and discussion across the crypto community. What prompts such a colossal shift of funds, and what could it mean for the broader market? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this significant USDT transfer . What Exactly Happened with This Massive USDT Transfer? On [Insert Date of Transaction if known, otherwise use ‘a recent date’], the blockchain tracking service Whale Alert reported a colossal transaction that sent ripples through the crypto space. A sum of 210 million Tether (USDT), the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, was moved from Kraken, a prominent U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange, to Bitfinex, another major global exchange. This substantial USDT transfer , equivalent to approximately $210 million, immediately caught the eye of market observers and analysts. Such large movements of funds, often termed ‘whale transactions,’ are typically indicative of significant underlying activities that can influence market dynamics. To put the scale into perspective: Amount: 210,000,000 USDT Value: Approximately $210,000,000 USD Origin: Kraken Exchange Destination: Bitfinex Exchange Reported by: Whale Alert While the immediate reason for this particular USDT transfer isn’t publicly disclosed, its sheer size warrants a closer look into the potential motivations and broader market ramifications. Why Do Such Large USDT Transfers Occur? Unpacking Whale Motives When a crypto ‘whale’ — an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency — executes a large USDT transfer , it’s rarely a random act. There are several strategic reasons behind such significant movements, often aimed at optimizing positions or capitalizing on market conditions. Understanding these motives is crucial for interpreting the potential impact of such a transaction. Common reasons for large stablecoin transfers include: Arbitrage Opportunities: Price discrepancies for cryptocurrencies often exist between different exchanges. A whale might move a large sum of USDT to an exchange where a specific asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) is trading at a lower price, allowing them to buy low and sell high on another exchange, thereby profiting from the difference. This rapid USDT transfer facilitates quick execution. Liquidity Management: Exchanges themselves, or large institutional traders, frequently move funds between their own hot and cold wallets, or between different exchange platforms, to manage liquidity. This ensures they have enough funds readily available to meet withdrawal demands or facilitate large trades without impacting market stability on a single platform. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: For transactions of this magnitude, whales often prefer OTC desks to avoid slippage (price changes due to large orders) on public exchanges. They might transfer USDT to an exchange’s OTC desk or a dedicated OTC platform to execute a private deal for a large block of cryptocurrency. Preparation for Large Trades: A whale might be accumulating or preparing to sell a significant amount of another cryptocurrency. Moving USDT to an exchange could indicate an intent to buy, while moving it off an exchange might suggest a large sale is imminent via an OTC desk or private transaction. Security and Custody: While less common for transfers between exchanges, some large holders might move funds for security reasons, consolidating assets or transferring them to a more secure cold storage solution. However, a transfer between two active exchanges usually points to transactional intent. It’s important to note that without direct confirmation from the parties involved, any interpretation of a large USDT transfer remains speculative. However, by considering these common motives, we can better gauge the potential implications. Kraken vs. Bitfinex: Key Players in the USDT Transfer Saga The choice of exchanges involved in a large USDT transfer can sometimes offer additional clues about the nature of the transaction. In this case, the movement occurred between Kraken and Bitfinex, both established and significant players in the global cryptocurrency landscape. Exchange Key Characteristics Role in Crypto Ecosystem Kraken Founded: 2011 Headquarters: San Francisco, USA Known for: Strong regulatory compliance, wide range of assets, robust security, institutional services.

2025-07-25 16:00:58+00:00,Is $1 Dogecoin ‚Inevitable‘? Analyst Cites Perfect Storm Of Factors,"Dogecoin could be approaching a structural breakout that carries it to the long-discussed $1 threshold, according to crypto analyst Stephan Burns, who in a July 24 livestream described a “perfect storm” of monetary design, market structure and what he characterizes as rare astrological alignments. Burns framed the move as an “inevitability,” while acknowledging timing uncertainty, arguing that the next parabolic advance could emerge within months. Is $1 Dogecoin Inevitable? Burns built his case first on tokenomics. Dogecoin’s fixed issuance of 10,000 DOGE per one-minute block—approximately 5.2 billion DOGE annually—translates today into an inflation rate of roughly 3.3% against a circulating supply he placed at 150 billion. With that supply base, he said, the network simultaneously sustains miner incentives, gradually replaces lost coins and avoids the periodic “supply shocks” embedded in Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving schedule. “It’s beautiful because of this inflation rate,” he said, calling Dogecoin “better as a currency than Bitcoin” precisely because of its predictability. By contrast, he argued, Bitcoin’s declining issuance—on track to fall below half a percent after the 2028 halving—forces a future reliance on transaction fees. “Eventually Bitcoin will be completely mined… the network has to be maintained by transaction fees. That’s probably not enough to incentivize miners at the end of the day,” Burns claims. Related Reading: Dogecoin Retests Crucial Support Following 8.6% Drop – Here Are The Levels To Watch He also asserted that Dogecoin’s governance surface is harder to co-opt than Bitcoin’s as large institutional and governmental actors accumulate BTC exposure. In his view, Dogecoin remains “the people’s currency,” with economic dilution limited by social and technical difficulty of altering code. The flat nominal issuance, he added, produces a declining percentage inflation rate over time without rendering the asset strictly deflationary or, in his words, vulnerable to miner attrition. Beyond economics, Burns devoted extensive time to what he calls “crypto astrology,” arguing that Dogecoin’s natal chart—anchored to its genesis block—now sits under exceptionally favorable transits. He highlighted Pluto’s conjunction with Dogecoin’s natal Moon, describing it as “a once in a roughly 250-year transit,” and an impending Jupiter return with the planet “exalted” near the project’s midheaven point. These, he claimed, historically correspond to phases of visibility, capital inflow and wealth symbolism. “Dogecoin is being activated… more than any other cryptocurrency this year,” he said, labeling the configuration a catalyst for renewed global attention. Burns linked those internal transits to a broader macro cycle, citing the approaching Saturn–Neptune conjunction at the first degrees of Aries in early 2026, which he associated—through earlier historical recurrences—with milestones such as the emergence of coinage and trade networks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Rally On Thin Ice: Analyst Predicts Sudden Shakeout In his view, that backdrop reinforces the plausibility of another speculative wave. A logarithmic review of Dogecoin’s price history, he said, shows three prior “parabolic” expansions separated by lengthening consolidation phases; the current basing structure, including what he described as an ascending W-pattern supported by long-term moving averages, could precede a fourth. “Just based off of that it looks like we may be due for another one of these parabolic moves up in the next few months,” he said, while conceding that “just because I think it doesn’t mean it’s going to happen.” He further projected that a Dogecoin exchange-traded fund “will get approved” and place the asset “in the spotlight,” though he did not provide documentation beyond his expectation. Burns also contrasted Dogecoin’s relative resilience on its Bitcoin ratio with altcoins that have reverted to prior ranges, arguing that structural holding above pre-2020 levels supports his thesis. Summarizing his outlook, Burns reiterated what he called the “inevitability of Dogecoin going to $1,” framing that level as the maximal target in his public analysis for the forthcoming cycle. The timing, he implied, hinges on the interplay between tokenomics-driven accumulation and the unfolding of the transits he tracks. “I do think it’s going to moon,” he concluded. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.23.

2025-07-25 16:01:11+00:00,"Has the Altcoin Season Started, Will It? Or Will It Never Start? Top Analysts Answer!","While altcoins have experienced a huge rise in recent days, led by Ethereum (ETH), the expectation of an altcoin season is increasing in the market. The strong performance of altcoins is attributed to strong institutional buying, with data showing a recent surge in institutional funds into Ethereum, XRP, and Solana. In addition to increased institutional inflows, the passage of the US stablecoin regulation law, the GENIUS Act, is also cited as one of the factors fueling the altcoin bull run. At this point, analysis companies and analysts expect the altcoin season to begin soon. Is Altcoin Season Near? Analysis firm Swissblock noted that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance is falling and funds are shifting from BTC to altcoins. “When this happens, when BTC dominance declines and funds generally shift towards altcoins, a strong altcoin season occurs. Currently, as Bitcoin''s upward momentum slows, capital rotation has begun, and if this trend continues, we could be entering a full-fledged altcoin season. Bitfinex analysts also believe an altcoin rally is imminent. They noted that the current situation could be the start of an altcoin season, with investors more interested in altcoins than BTC. “Investors are shifting their funds from Bitcoin to altcoins to capture further upside potential. This signals the start of an altcoin-centric period in the overall bull market.” While analysts at Bitfinex and Swissblock are expecting an altcoin rally, one analyst argued that it is difficult for altcoins to experience a sudden surge unlike previous cycles. “As Ethereum starts to rally, there''s a high probability that liquidity will flow into altcoins more broadly, but at the same time, it will be difficult to see sudden and sharp gains of more than 100x for the majority of altcoins as in the past. The uptrend will likely continue for altcoins with solid fundamentals, such as a real user base and revenue generation,” said Kyung-pil Jang, Head of Research at Xangle. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-25 16:01:20+00:00,Strategy Doubles Down on Bitcoin with $2.47B Preferred Stock Offering,"Nasdaq-listed firm Strategy has announced a significant move to raise new funds through the sale of a special class of stock. This step is part of its ongoing plan to invest heavily in Bitcoin (BTC). The deal is expected to be completed by July 29, and Strategy anticipates receiving approximately $2.47 billion after deducting fees and expenses. These funds will be used to support general business operations, including the purchase of additional Bitcoin and covering daily operational expenses. $2.47B Capital Raise Through Preferred Stock Offering In a recent press statement, Strategy shared plans to sell 28 million shares of its Series A Stretch Preferred Stock (STRC). Each share will be priced at $90 through an initial public offering (IPO). The new STRC Stock will pay investors a monthly dividend at a 9% yearly rate based on a $100 value per share. These payments are scheduled to begin on August 31, pending approval by the company’s board. Strategy also has the option to adjust the dividend rate depending on market conditions, but this will be done within set limits. If the company fails to pay dividends on time, interest will build on the missed payments. Once the STRC shares are listed on a U.S. stock exchange, Strategy can choose to buy back some. The company would pay $101 per share, along with any unpaid dividends. However, for any partial buyback, there must still be at least $250 million worth of STRC shares left. Strategy’s Massive Bitcoin Holdings Continue to Grow Strategy recently revealed it has acquired 6,220 Bitcoin units for about $739.8 million , at an average price of $118,940 per coin. This latest purchase was made between July 14 and July 20. This brings the company’s crypto total stash to 607,770 BTC, worth over $71 billion. This makes Strategy one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin in the world, outpacing Nvidia . This continued investment highlights Executive Chairman Michael Saylor’s strong belief in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value. Saylor views the top coin as “digital energy” and a shield against inflation and economic instability. His bold approach has encouraged many other companies to think about adding digital assets to their balance sheets. Market Response and Stock Performance As of July 25, Strategy’s Class A stock (MSTR) closed at $414.92. While there was no change during regular trading, pre-market trading showed a 2.30% dip, with the stock priced at $405.37. Notably, the stock has experienced significant fluctuations in the past year. Effectively, it reached a high of $543.00 and a low of $102.40. This illustrates how closely the company’s stock price is tied to the value of Bitcoin. Despite the volatility, Strategy boasts a market value of $116.58 billion. This makes it the most relevant Bitcoin stock in the market.

2025-07-25 16:30:10+00:00,Bitcoin Whale Unleashed: Historic $457M Move After 14.5 Years,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Unleashed: Historic $457M Move After 14.5 Years The cryptocurrency world thrives on constant motion, but every so often, a truly monumental event sends ripples across the digital ocean. Imagine a colossal treasure chest, sealed for nearly a decade and a half, suddenly creaking open. This isn’t a scene from a fantasy novel; it’s the reality of a long-dormant Bitcoin whale , an entity that has just made its first significant move in 14.5 years, sending shockwaves of curiosity and speculation through the market. For those closely observing the digital asset landscape, the sudden activity of a wallet inactive since January 2011 is nothing short of remarkable. This particular wallet, holding a staggering 3,963 BTC—worth approximately $457 million at current prices—has broken its long silence. The question on everyone’s mind: What prompted this awakening, and what might it mean for the broader crypto ecosystem? What Does a Dormant Bitcoin Whale ‘s Awakening Signify? In the lexicon of cryptocurrency, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of a particular digital asset. When a Bitcoin whale of this magnitude, one that has remained dormant for such an extended period, suddenly stirs, it naturally captures the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. The last time these particular Bitcoins saw any movement, the price of a single BTC was a mere $0.32. This translates to an astronomical profit margin, making the owner’s decision to finally move funds a subject of intense scrutiny. The significance of such an event lies in several factors: Rarity: Wallets remaining untouched for over a decade are exceptionally rare. Their sudden activation often signals a major shift in the holder’s strategy or circumstances. Market Impact Potential: While this whale’s holdings are substantial, the immediate market impact depends on the nature of the transaction. A full liquidation could introduce significant selling pressure, whereas a smaller transfer might indicate a test or rebalancing. Psychological Effect: The very act of a long-dormant whale moving funds can influence market sentiment, sparking both excitement and caution among participants. It reminds us of the early days of Bitcoin and the foresight of its pioneers. This particular Bitcoin whale ‘s move is a powerful reminder of the incredible long-term gains possible in the cryptocurrency space and the unique characteristics of its early adopters. Understanding the Mechanics: How This Bitcoin Whale ‘s Transaction Unfolded The details of this historic transaction provide crucial insights into the whale’s intentions. The wallet, identified by its long period of inactivity, transferred 50 BTC out of its massive holdings. This 50 BTC was sent to an address that has been previously associated with major cryptocurrency entities such as Coinbase, B2C2, and Galaxy Digital. These are well-known names in the crypto world, often serving as exchanges, prime brokers, or institutional trading desks. Here’s a snapshot of the transaction’s key figures: Metric Details Wallet Inactivity Period 14.5 years (since January 2011) Total BTC Held 3,963 BTC Current Value of Holdings Approximately $457 million Original Acquisition Cost per BTC $0.32 Amount Transferred 50 BTC Estimated Profit on Transferred BTC Over $5.7 million (based on current prices) Recipient Addresses Associated with Coinbase, B2C2, Galaxy Digital The transfer of 50 BTC, while significant in absolute terms, represents a relatively small fraction of the whale’s total 3,963 BTC holdings. This partial movement could indicate several possibilities: A Test Transaction: Whales often send a small amount first to ensure the address is correct and the transaction goes through smoothly before initiating larger transfers. Liquidity Provision: Moving funds to exchanges or trading desks could mean the whale intends to sell a portion of their holdings, potentially through over-the-counter (OTC) desks to minimize market impact. Rebalancing or Diversification: The whale might be moving funds to different wallets, consolidating holdings, or preparing to diversify into other assets or financial instruments. Custodial Transfer: It’s also possible the whale is moving funds to a new custodian or a more secure storage solution. The fact that the funds were sent to addresses associated with institutional players suggests a sophisticated approach, likely aimed at managing such a large sum discreetly and efficiently. Historical Precedents: The Impact of Past Bitcoin Whale Movements This isn’t the first time a large Bitcoin holder has made headlines with significant transactions. Earlier this year, another major holder offloaded approximately 80,000 BTC, which had a noticeable, albeit temporary, impact on market dynamics. However, the current Bitcoin whale ‘s activity, involving a transfer of 50 BTC, is of a much smaller scale compared to such massive sell-offs.

This resilient support has sparked optimism that Bitcoin could potentially achieve a 100% gain, effectively doubling from present price levels.

2025-07-25 16:40:11+00:00,Unveiling the Shocking Coinbase Selling Pressure Impact on Bitcoin,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Shocking Coinbase Selling Pressure Impact on Bitcoin The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic realm, often characterized by swift price movements that can leave even seasoned investors scratching their heads. Recently, the crypto community has been abuzz with discussions surrounding a notable surge in Coinbase selling pressure , a phenomenon that appears to be directly influencing Bitcoin’s recent price adjustments. Understanding these underlying forces is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile digital asset landscape. What’s Driving the Current Coinbase Selling Pressure? In the intricate world of on-chain analysis, every large transaction tells a story. Pseudonymous yet respected on-chain analyst “Murphy” recently brought to light a significant factor contributing to Bitcoin’s recent downturn: substantial inflows into Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. This isn’t just about a few coins moving; we’re talking about thousands of Bitcoin being deposited, often signaling an intent to sell. Initial Wave: An initial deposit of 4,950 BTC landed on Coinbase, coinciding with Bitcoin’s price falling towards the $115,000 mark. This substantial transfer immediately raised eyebrows among analysts monitoring exchange flows. Second Surge: Just an hour later, another significant tranche of 3,169 BTC was moved onto the same exchange. This follow-up deposit reinforced the notion of sustained selling intent, adding further downward pressure. Total Impact: Combined, these two events saw over 8,100 BTC, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, transferred to Coinbase within a very short period. Such large-scale movements from wallets to exchanges are typically interpreted as a precursor to selling, as traders and whales often move their holdings to exchanges when they intend to liquidate. This concentrated influx of Bitcoin into a major exchange like Coinbase is a key indicator that merits close attention. It suggests that a significant entity, or multiple entities, are offloading substantial amounts of Bitcoin, creating the observed Coinbase selling pressure . Why Do Coinbase Deposits Matter So Much? Coinbase holds a unique position in the crypto ecosystem. As one of the most accessible and regulated exchanges, it serves a wide range of investors, from retail participants to large institutional players. When large sums of Bitcoin are deposited into Coinbase, it can have a disproportionate impact on the market for several reasons: Institutional Presence: Coinbase is often favored by institutional investors due to its regulatory compliance and robust infrastructure. Large deposits here can sometimes signal institutional liquidation or rebalancing, which carries more weight than retail selling. Liquidity Impact: While exchanges have deep order books, a sudden influx of sell orders can quickly absorb available buy-side liquidity, leading to rapid price depreciation. The more Bitcoin available for sale, the greater the potential for price drops if demand doesn’t match supply. Market Sentiment: On-chain data is increasingly used by traders to gauge market sentiment. Significant exchange inflows, especially into a platform like Coinbase, can trigger fear and uncertainty, leading other holders to panic sell, exacerbating the downward trend. This collective reaction amplifies the initial Coinbase selling pressure . Understanding these dynamics is vital. It’s not just the quantity of Bitcoin, but also the context of where it’s moving that provides crucial insights into market movements. Decoding On-Chain Signals: What Does This Tell Us About Market Stages? On-chain analysis is the practice of examining publicly available data on a blockchain to gain insights into market behavior. It’s like looking directly into the ledger of all transactions, providing a transparent view of supply and demand dynamics. In this instance, Murphy’s analysis leverages these insights to draw conclusions about the current market phase. The analyst’s conclusion that this adjustment could be in its “final stages” if no further large-scale deposits occur is a critical point. This suggests a belief that the primary source of the recent Coinbase selling pressure has largely expended its supply. Here’s what that implies: Scenario Market Implication On-Chain Evidence No Further Large Deposits Selling pressure subsides, potential for price stabilization or rebound. Exchange inflows decrease significantly; exchange balances might even start to decline. Continued Large Deposits Selling pressure persists, risk of further price declines. Sustained high exchange inflows, particularly to spot exchanges like Coinbase. Outflows from Exchanges Accumulation phase, bullish signal as coins are moved to cold storage.

This isn’t merely an optimistic outlook; it’s presented as their bullish case, indicating a scenario where several favorable factors align to propel Bitcoin to new heights. Such a significant forecast from an institution like Citibank carries considerable weight. It suggests a deeper analysis and understanding of the cryptocurrency market, moving beyond the skepticism often associated with traditional financial entities. This prediction isn’t just a number; it reflects a growing institutional belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. However, it’s crucial to understand that financial predictions, especially in the volatile crypto market, are rarely set in stone. Citibank, acknowledging this inherent uncertainty, has also provided a range of scenarios to offer a more comprehensive view of Bitcoin’s potential trajectory. Diving Deeper: Citibank’s Multi-Tiered Bitcoin Price Prediction Scenarios While the headline-grabbing $199,000 figure represents Citibank’s most optimistic outlook, their analysis is far more nuanced. To provide a balanced perspective, the institution has reportedly outlined three distinct scenarios for its Bitcoin price prediction : The Bullish Case: $199,000 by Year-End This is the projection that has captured significant attention. It suggests a confluence of positive market drivers, potentially including increased institutional adoption, favorable regulatory developments, sustained retail interest, and perhaps a post-halving supply shock, could push Bitcoin to unprecedented levels. This scenario implies a strong demand outpacing available supply, leading to significant price appreciation. The Base Case: $135,000 Considered the “realistic” projection, the base case suggests Bitcoin could settle around $135,000. This scenario likely factors in a more moderate growth trajectory, acknowledging potential market corrections or slower adoption rates compared to the bullish scenario. It represents a more conservative yet still highly positive outlook for Bitcoin’s performance. The Bearish Case: $64,000 by End of 2025 Citibank also provides a bearish Bitcoin price prediction , projecting Bitcoin to finish up 2025 at $64,000. It’s important to note the timeframe here – this bearish outlook extends into the following year, suggesting a potential prolonged period of consolidation or correction. Factors contributing to such a scenario could include unexpected regulatory crackdowns, significant macroeconomic downturns, or a loss of investor confidence due to unforeseen events. This multi-tiered approach highlights the inherent uncertainties in forecasting future asset prices, especially for a nascent and volatile asset class like cryptocurrency. It provides investors with a spectrum of possibilities, allowing them to assess risk and potential returns based on different market conditions. Why Does This Bitcoin Price Prediction Matter? The significance of Citibank’s Bitcoin price prediction extends far beyond mere numbers. It represents several crucial developments in the broader financial landscape: Institutional Validation: When a venerable institution like Citibank issues such a forecast, it lends significant credibility to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. It signals that major financial players are not only observing but actively analyzing and forecasting the future of digital currencies. Shifting Perceptions: For years, Bitcoin was often dismissed as a niche asset for tech enthusiasts or a tool for illicit activities. Forecasts from mainstream banks challenge these outdated perceptions, helping to normalize Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the eyes of traditional investors and the general public.

While Bitcoin battles to break through critical $118K resistance and Ethereum pushes toward new highs, a revolutionary GambleFi protocol is quietly positioning itself to deliver extraordinary returns to early adopters. BitLemons ($BLEM) has emerged as the standout investment opportunity, combining real revenue generation with deflationary tokenomics in a way that puts traditional crypto projects to shame. With over $2 million raised and momentum accelerating rapidly, analysts are predicting this could be the defining investment opportunity of 2025. Could BitLemons ($BLEM) Be the Ultimate Revenue-Generating Crypto Investment of 2025? BitLemons isn’t just another speculative token – it’s a fully operational crypto casino disrupting the massive $450 billion traditional gambling industry. With over 8,000 games from premium providers like Evolution and Pragmatic, this platform generates revenue 24/7, creating real value that flows directly back to token holders. The numbers speak volumes about investor confidence. After raising $1 million in their private seed round, BitLemons has continued its impressive fundraising momentum. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, Stage 2 has completely sold out, and Stage 3 is already 12.72% filled with tokens currently priced at $0.03. With 13 presale stages total, starting at $0.01 and increasing by $0.01 with each stage, the upward price trajectory is built into the tokenomics. What sets BitLemons apart is its institutional-grade security and transparency. The project boasts dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof – a level of validation that its competitors simply can’t match. This commitment to security has helped fuel rumors of a potential listing price between $0.17–$0.18, representing massive upside potential for current investors. The tokenomics model is where BitLemons truly shines. The protocol allocates 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) directly to token value creation: 15% goes toward token buyback and burn mechanisms, creating deflationary pressure, while another 15% provides staking rewards for holders. This dual approach ensures that as the platform grows, token holders benefit from both reduced supply and passive income generation. Will Bitcoin Finally Break Through the Crucial $118K Barrier This Week? Bitcoin is currently testing a critical juncture just below $118K, setting up what could be the most important breakout attempt in recent weeks. Despite regulatory headwinds from the new “Genius Act,” the world’s largest cryptocurrency continues to show remarkable resilience, maintaining strong support levels while institutional players position for the next major move. The technical setup is particularly compelling as Bitcoin approaches this psychological resistance level. MicroStrategy and Trump Media continue their aggressive accumulation strategy, adding approximately $8K worth of BTC through corporate purchases, demonstrating unwavering institutional confidence. Strong buying pressure is evident just below the $118K level, with bulls defending key support around $116K-$117K. A decisive break above $118K could trigger rapid acceleration toward $120K and potentially $130K, though failure to break through may result in a pullback to test lower support levels around $115K. Is Ethereum’s $4.39 Billion Institutional Surge Signaling the Start of Altseason? Ethereum has captured the spotlight with institutional inflows to ETH products surging to a record-breaking $4.39 billion, representing a significant capital rotation from Bitcoin toward “Ethereum-led altseason” opportunities. This massive influx of institutional capital demonstrates growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and its potential for continued growth.

2025-07-25 16:48:10+00:00,"Weekly Crypto Regulation News Roundup: GENIUS Act Hits Big Tech, SEC Reverses on ETF","This week, the crypto regulatory landscape was thrown into sharp relief as U.S. lawmakers and agencies issued new frameworks, reversed approvals, and closed long-running investigations. A clear message emerged: the U.S. is moving quickly to shape the next phase of digital asset oversight, with both Congress and federal agencies playing pivotal roles. GENIUS Act Draws Line Against Big Tech in Stablecoins One of the most notable updates comes from the recently enacted GENIUS Act, which includes a provision aimed squarely at preventing Big Tech and Wall Street from dominating the stablecoin sector. Commonly referred to as the “Libra clause,” the rule references Meta’s failed global currency project and reflects regulators’ determination to avoid similar power consolidation in future digital money systems. A provision in GENIUS Act aims to curb the influence of tech conglomerates and major financial institutions in the US stablecoin market. #GENIUS #Stablecoins https://t.co/IE7FZdWjXw — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 21, 2025 Under this clause, any non-bank firm aiming to issue a dollar-backed stablecoin must establish a separate, standalone legal entity to house the operation. That entity would be required to undergo antitrust scrutiny and secure clearance from a Treasury-led oversight committee, which holds veto power. Banks are also subject to restrictions. They must issue stablecoins through legally distinct subsidiaries that are prohibited from engaging in leverage, lending, or any activity that could pose broader financial risks. This creates a highly controlled environment, with boundaries that Circle’s Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte described as more conservative than deposit-token models being explored by large financial institutions like JPMorgan. The measure shows an aggressive push by U.S. regulators to ensure the stablecoin space does not replicate past issues of too-big-to-fail institutions dominating financial infrastructure. It also sets the stage for a broader reimagining of how the U.S. will handle fiat-backed digital assets in the years to come. Senate Introduces Market Structure Framework for Crypto Building on the momentum of the GENIUS Act, the Senate Banking Committee unveiled a new draft bill designed to restructure how digital assets are classified and regulated. Titled the Responsible Financial Innovation Act of 2025, the bill is co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott, Cynthia Lummis, Bill Hagerty, and Bernie Moreno. Senate Banking Chair @SenatorTimScott , @CynthiaMLummis , @SenatorHagerty , @BernieMoreno release a draft on crypto market structure—seeking feedback on 35+ topics. #CryptoMarket #CryptoPolicy https://t.co/XUh532lA9j — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 22, 2025 This new legislation attempts to address long-standing confusion in the crypto sector by providing a clearer framework for when tokens should be treated as commodities versus securities. It draws from prior legislative attempts such as the bipartisan Lummis-Gillibrand proposal and incorporates elements of the House-passed CLARITY Act. By creating consistent regulatory definitions and assigning clearer jurisdictional responsibilities to the SEC and the CFTC, the bill hopes to provide digital asset companies with the certainty they’ve long asked for. It also represents growing bipartisan awareness that crypto markets need regulation — but not at the cost of innovation. If passed, the bill could fundamentally change how digital assets are launched, traded, and reported in the U.S. market. DOJ Drops Case Against Jesse Powell In another headline-grabbing twist, the U.S. Department of Justice has reportedly closed its investigation into Kraken founder Jesse Powell, ending a legal saga that began with a raid on his home in 2023.

2025-07-25 16:55:10+00:00,Bitcoin Transfers Trigger Massive $4B Short Surge,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transfers Trigger Massive $4B Short Surge The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic beast, constantly reacting to a myriad of factors, from macroeconomic shifts to the subtle movements of whales. Recently, a significant event sent ripples across major exchanges, highlighting the intricate dance between large asset movements and market sentiment. We’re talking about a staggering $4 billion surge in short positions, directly coinciding with substantial Bitcoin transfers to key platforms. This isn’t just a number; it’s a flashing signal for anyone tracking the digital asset space. Decoding the Signal: What Exactly are These Bitcoin Transfers? According to Julio Moreno, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain analytics firm, the past 24 hours saw a dramatic increase in open interest on several prominent exchanges. Specifically, Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io collectively witnessed a sharp $4 billion rise in open interest. This surge wasn’t isolated; it occurred precisely when a significant volume of Bitcoin transfers landed on these platforms. But what does this really mean? Large-Scale Movements: These weren’t your everyday retail transactions. The sheer volume suggests institutional players, whales, or large-scale traders moving substantial amounts of BTC. Open Interest Explained: Open interest (OI) represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A rise in OI indicates new money flowing into the market, either from new long (buy) or short (sell) positions. Exchange Concentration: The fact that Binance and Bybit reportedly received a significant portion of the transferred BTC is crucial. These are major hubs for both spot and derivatives trading, making them prime locations for market-moving activities. When large Bitcoin transfers hit exchanges, it often precedes significant price action. Traders watch these movements closely, as they can signal impending liquidity shifts or strategic positioning by major market participants. The $4 Billion Short Surge: A Bearish Bet or Strategic Play? The most intriguing aspect of CryptoQuant’s report is the implication that this massive rise in open interest was primarily driven by an increase in short positions. For those new to derivatives, a short position is essentially a bet that the price of an asset will fall. Traders borrow an asset, sell it, and aim to buy it back at a lower price later, profiting from the difference. A $4 billion short surge is a substantial amount, indicating a strong conviction among a segment of the market that Bitcoin’s price might be heading downwards. Why Would Large Bitcoin Transfers Lead to Short Positions? This is the million-dollar question. Several theories could explain this correlation: Anticipation of Price Correction: Whales or large entities might be moving BTC to exchanges with the intent to sell, or to open short positions in anticipation of a market correction after a period of gains. They might be hedging against their existing spot holdings. Arbitrage Opportunities: Large transfers could be part of an arbitrage strategy, where discrepancies in prices across different exchanges or derivatives markets are exploited. This often involves taking opposing positions (long on one, short on another) to lock in profits. Liquidation Fuel: Sometimes, large transfers are used to provide collateral for massive short positions, aiming to push the price down and potentially trigger liquidations of long positions, further exacerbating a downtrend. Market Manipulation: While difficult to prove, large, coordinated movements can sometimes be part of a strategy to influence market sentiment and price direction. The fact that Binance and Bybit, known for their robust derivatives platforms, received a significant portion of these Bitcoin transfers lends weight to the theory that these movements were intended to facilitate large-scale derivatives trading, specifically shorting. Are These Bitcoin Transfers a Definitive Bearish Signal? While a surge in short positions often suggests bearish sentiment, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. The crypto market is notoriously complex, and single data points rarely tell the whole story. Here’s why: Hedging Strategies: Many institutional players and whales use short positions to hedge their existing spot holdings. If they hold a large amount of Bitcoin, they might open short positions to protect against potential price drops without selling their underlying assets. This is a common risk management strategy. Market Liquidity: Large transfers to exchanges can also be for increasing liquidity for various trading pairs, or for over-the-counter (OTC) deals that don’t directly impact the public order books initially. Potential for Short Squeezes: A large accumulation of short positions can also create conditions for a “short squeeze.” If Bitcoin’s price unexpectedly rises, short sellers are forced to ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-transfers-short-surge/,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BNB,Crypto News|BINANCE|BITCOIN|CryptoQuant|Market Analysis|open interest,BTC,"Bitcoin Transfers Trigger Massive $4B Short Surge.

This often involves taking opposing positions (long on one, short on another) to lock in profits. Liquidation Fuel: Sometimes, large transfers are used to provide collateral for massive short positions, aiming to push the price down and potentially trigger liquidations of long positions, further exacerbating a downtrend. Market Manipulation: While difficult to prove, large, coordinated movements can sometimes be part of a strategy to influence market sentiment and price direction. The fact that Binance and Bybit, known for their robust derivatives platforms, received a significant portion of these Bitcoin transfers lends weight to the theory that these movements were intended to facilitate large-scale derivatives trading, specifically shorting. Are These Bitcoin Transfers a Definitive Bearish Signal? While a surge in short positions often suggests bearish sentiment, it’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions. The crypto market is notoriously complex, and single data points rarely tell the whole story. Here’s why: Hedging Strategies: Many institutional players and whales use short positions to hedge their existing spot holdings. If they hold a large amount of Bitcoin, they might open short positions to protect against potential price drops without selling their underlying assets. This is a common risk management strategy. Market Liquidity: Large transfers to exchanges can also be for increasing liquidity for various trading pairs, or for over-the-counter (OTC) deals that don’t directly impact the public order books initially. Potential for Short Squeezes: A large accumulation of short positions can also create conditions for a “short squeeze.” If Bitcoin’s price unexpectedly rises, short sellers are forced to"

Non-sovereign issuers are non-federal bond issuers like local and regional governments and public agencies. Bloomberg reports that Asia-Pacific companies and non-sovereign issuers have sold $1.5 trillion in local-currency bonds year-to-date, a record in that time frame. The sales represent a 6% increase. Daniel Tan, a portfolio manager for global emerging markets at Grasshopper Asset Management, tells Bloomberg the number of bond buyers has surged in the second quarter of the year. “We are definitely seeing more buyers of local-currency Asian bonds than in pre-April. There are large inflows from pension and sovereign wealth funds looking to diversify away from US dollar assets.” US President Donald Trump kicked off his wave of tariffs in April, spurring macroeconomic uncertainty. Angus Hui, the deputy chief investment officer at the Singapore-based investment firm Fullerton Fund Management, tells Bloomberg that “diversification into broader Asian local currency markets is likely to accelerate.” The Bloomberg Asia-Pacific Aggregate index, a multi-currency benchmark based on Asia-Pacific investment-grade bonds, has beaten the US-based bond metric, gaining 3.9% year-to-date compared to 3.5%, respectively.

The crypto world is buzzing with renewed vigor! Bitcoin price , the undisputed pioneer of digital assets, has once again captured global headlines, ascending majestically past the significant $116,000 mark. This impressive rally, meticulously observed by market monitoring platforms like Bitcoin World and widely reported across major exchanges such as Binance, has ignited a fresh wave of excitement and intense speculation across the digital asset landscape. For both seasoned investors and curious newcomers, the central question remains: what powerful forces are fueling this extraordinary ascent, and what profound implications does this have for the future trajectory of your digital portfolio? What’s Behind the Ascent of Bitcoin Price? Understanding the dynamics that propel the Bitcoin price requires a look at a confluence of factors, ranging from institutional adoption to macroeconomic shifts and the inherent design of the cryptocurrency itself. This isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s the result of growing confidence and increasing utility in the digital asset space. Several key drivers are contributing to Bitcoin’s remarkable performance: Institutional Influx: The escalating interest and direct investment from institutional players are a major catalyst. The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened regulated pathways for traditional finance to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This creates substantial demand pressure from large institutions, hedge funds, and corporate treasuries, lending immense credibility and liquidity to the market. Macroeconomic Headwinds: In an era characterized by persistent inflation and geopolitical uncertainties, traditional fiat currencies are under scrutiny. Investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and fixed supply, is increasingly viewed as “digital gold” – a hedge against inflation and a potential safe haven during economic instability, drawing in capital from those looking to preserve purchasing power. The Halving Cycle’s Influence: Bitcoin’s supply schedule is governed by “halving” events, occurring approximately every four years, which cut the reward for mining new blocks in half. This deflationary mechanism reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation, contributing to long-term scarcity and often influencing the Bitcoin price positively over time. Technological Evolution and Network Health: The underlying Bitcoin network continues to evolve and strengthen with developments in scaling solutions, security enhancements, and broader integration into financial systems. A robust and secure network fosters greater trust and encourages wider adoption, crucial for sustained price growth. Growing Retail Interest: As Bitcoin makes headlines, it naturally attracts renewed attention from individual investors. The “Fear Of Missing Out” (FOMO) phenomenon can lead to a surge in retail buying, creating a positive feedback loop that further propels the price upwards. The Domino Effect: How Bitcoin Price Impacts the Wider Crypto Market Bitcoin’s position as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization means its movements often dictate the broader sentiment and direction of the entire crypto market. It acts as the market’s bellwether, and a significant shift in Bitcoin price can send ripples through the ecosystem, affecting altcoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Here’s how Bitcoin’s performance creates a domino effect: Market Dominance and Sentiment: Bitcoin typically holds a substantial portion of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. When Bitcoin rallies, it signals a healthy market, boosting overall investor confidence. This positive sentiment frequently spills over into altcoins, leading to what is often referred to as an “altcoin season.” Conversely, a sharp drop in Bitcoin’s value can trigger widespread sell-offs across the altcoin market. Liquidity and Capital Flows: Bitcoin’s liquidity is unparalleled. When new capital enters the market, it often flows into Bitcoin first. As Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or reaches milestones, some of that capital might then rotate into altcoins, seeking higher percentage gains. This capital rotation is common in bull markets. Psychological Impact: Bitcoin’s price movements have a profound psychological impact on investors. A surging Bitcoin can create a sense of optimism and a belief that a bull market is firmly in place, encouraging more risk-taking across the board. This collective psychological shift can fuel rallies in other assets.

Citi''s most optimistic scenario has Bitcoin reaching as high as $199,000 by the end of the year, while a more pessimistic scenario sees it plummet to an estimated $64,000, primarily due to weak stock performance. Citi''s updated forecast considers three main factors: user adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and demand for spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The bank noted that these factors will significantly shape Bitcoin''s price. At the heart of his company''s approach is an adoption model based on user activity. The bank''s analysts predict a 20% increase in user growth and linear network effects, noting that this factor alone could push Bitcoin''s price to around $75,000. Related News: BREAKING NEWS: Coinbase Adds Surprise Altcoin to its Roadmap for Listing Macroeconomic factors, driven by weak stocks and gold performance, lowered the forecast by $3,200, while an estimated $15 billion in ETF inflows added $63,000 to the price estimate. Consequently, the base-case year-end target was set at $135,000. ETF flows have become a central force in Bitcoin’s price action since the approval of US spot products in January 2024. Citi noted that these flows alone account for over 40% of the recent BTC price change and are given a major role in its new model. The bank noted that while the adoption curve is still the cornerstone of the model, the integration of cryptocurrencies with traditional finance through ETFs, index inclusion, and growing regulatory acceptance is increasing the importance of macroeconomic and institutional flows.

2025-07-25 17:18:12+00:00,Ethereum’s Rebound Isn’t Hype: On-Chain Signals Point to a Bigger Rally Ahead,"After enduring months of criticism for lagging behind other crypto assets, Ethereum is making a strong return as it reclaims market share. Despite the recent pullback, the altcoin appears to be closing in on $4,000. Whale Accumulation Hints at Much Bigger Move Underneath its price action, large holders are quietly gearing up to fuel the rally, new data from Santiment shows. Since early 2025, wallets holding 10,000 to 100,000 ETH have steadily accumulated, indicating institutional players are stepping in before mainstream retail hype takes over. Alongside this, Santiment also observed a rise in ETH-related social discussions, which suggests that the current surge is rooted in on-chain fundamentals and strategic positioning rather than short-term retail FOMO. The crypto analytic firm also found that, unlike previous cycles where ETH largely followed Bitcoin’s trajectory, Ethereum is showing its own independent momentum this time. Its market value ratio relative to Bitcoin has surged by 64% since May 8, 2025, which reflects how investor confidence is shifting back to the altcoin’s fundamentals. Interestingly, it was the deep bearish sentiment at the start of 2025 that may have set the stage for this rebound. ETH Sentiment Flips From Fear to Confidence When Ethereum touched $1,450 on April 8 this year, sentiment across crypto forums and social platforms was bleak. On X, Reddit, and Telegram, bullish-to-bearish comment ratios sat around 3:5, which indicated fear and doubt at their peak. Historically, such fear often precedes opportunity, and this cycle has been no exception. By late July, as Ethereum climbed, sentiment flipped decisively to a 2:1 bullish-to-bearish ratio, which pointed to a return of trader confidence. Santiment notes that this transformation is a stark contrast to the panic seen in early spring, but it also hints at pockets of FOMO beginning to surface. However, the current sentiment is cooler than the “frothy” 3.5:1 bullish ratio recorded in mid-June, which suggests that optimism has moderated while maintaining constructive momentum. This moderation could serve as a healthier foundation for the rally to resume if bullish commentary continues to cool. Adding to the optimism are supportive headlines. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee recently predicted that the crypto asset could reach $10,000-$15,000, owing to ETF inflows, institutional demand, and AI infrastructure tailwinds as catalysts.

The crypto analytic firm also found that, unlike previous cycles where ETH largely followed Bitcoin’s trajectory, Ethereum is showing its own independent momentum this time. Its market value ratio relative to Bitcoin has surged by 64% since May 8, 2025, which reflects how investor confidence is shifting back to the altcoin’s fundamentals. Interestingly, it was the deep bearish sentiment at the start of 2025 that may have set the stage for this rebound. ETH Sentiment Flips From Fear to Confidence When Ethereum touched $1,450 on April 8 this year, sentiment across crypto forums and social platforms was bleak. On X, Reddit, and Telegram, bullish-to-bearish comment ratios sat around 3:5, which indicated fear and doubt at their peak. Historically, such fear often precedes opportunity, and this cycle has been no exception. By late July, as Ethereum climbed, sentiment flipped decisively to a 2:1 bullish-to-bearish ratio, which pointed to a return of trader confidence. Santiment notes that this transformation is a stark contrast to the panic seen in early spring, but it also hints at pockets of FOMO beginning to surface. However, the current sentiment is cooler than the “frothy” 3.5:1 bullish ratio recorded in mid-June, which suggests that optimism has moderated while maintaining constructive momentum. This moderation could serve as a healthier foundation for the rally to resume if bullish commentary continues to cool. Adding to the optimism are supportive headlines. Fundstrat’s Tom Lee recently predicted that the crypto asset could reach $10,000-$15,000, owing to ETF inflows, institutional demand, and AI infrastructure tailwinds as catalysts.

2025-07-25 17:22:32+00:00,"Bitcoin range-bound ahead of Fed decision, CFX, ENA post double digit weekly gains","Bitcoin moved sideways this week, trading within a narrow range between $115,184 and $119,959. Momentum slowed heading into Friday, with no major breakout in either direction. The total cryptocurrency market cap briefly crossed the $4 trillion mark before retreating to $3.85 trillion. This reflected a decline of more than 6% late in the week. Broader sentiment remained bullish. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index stayed in greed territory, though it had fallen three points from the previous week at press time. Altcoins outperformed Bitcoin. While the leading cryptocurrency was down over 2% on the week, several high-cap tokens ended with double-digit gains. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin remains range-bound as conflicting forces weigh on short-term price direction. A sharp rise in open interest, now at an all-time high of $44.5 billion, is a sign of a speculative market. This trend comes alongside falling prices, which happens when there is a buildup of leveraged positions that heightens the risk of sudden volatility and forced liquidations. Instead of long-term investors, the market is seeing a wave of short-term traders attempting to capitalise on rapid price swings. Analysts have observed that many are entering long positions without waiting for clear confirmation, a sign of heightened FOMO after Bitcoin briefly rallied from $116,000 to $120,000 earlier this week. That rally was quickly sold off, as larger players used the $120,000 mark to offload holdings, reinforcing it as a key resistance level. Binance data shows the price of perpetual contracts has moved above the spot rate, suggesting an upward bias during intraday moves. However, funding rates remain neutral, which means the market is largely undecided about the direction of the broader trend. Profit-taking is also limiting further upside. Bitcoin’s recent surge, which has taken it over 65% above its April lows, has prompted investors to lock in gains. This trend is playing out across the market, particularly among altcoins that have recorded stronger rallies. Broader macroeconomic uncertainty is another drag. The upcoming August 1 tariff deadline, with the US planning to impose sweeping trade restrictions, is fuelling risk-off sentiment. While agreements have been reached with Japan and the Philippines, talks with the EU and South Korea remain unresolved. Additionally, traders are cautious ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. While there is hope for a rate cut, officials have signalled that monetary easing is unlikely in July. With inflation ticking higher, most analysts now expect the first cut to come in September or October, delaying the kind of policy support that often boosts crypto markets. Will Bitcoin go up? Despite Bitcoin’s late-week slowdown, bullish conviction remains strong. A notable options trade on Deribit saw a high-net-worth investor place a $23.7 million bet on Bitcoin reaching $200,000 by year-end. The trade used a December $140K–$200K bull call spread, a setup that puts a ceiling on both risk and reward. Such whale activity often draws attention, as similar trades have shaped price action in previous cycles. Analysts view these structured bets as signs of long-term confidence, even as the market navigates short-term volatility. According to Deribit Insights, this structure leans on lower implied volatility at the $140K strike while offsetting costs with pricier $200K calls, essentially a calculated bet on Bitcoin breaking into record territory soon.

2025-07-25 17:25:10+00:00,US Semiconductor Market: Unveiling the Crucial 2025 Transformations in AI Chips and Export Controls,"BitcoinWorld US Semiconductor Market: Unveiling the Crucial 2025 Transformations in AI Chips and Export Controls The digital frontier, from groundbreaking AI models to the intricate networks powering cryptocurrencies, hinges on one foundational element: semiconductors. In 2025, the US semiconductor market experienced a whirlwind of innovation, geopolitical maneuvering, and strategic shifts, shaping not just the future of computing but the very landscape of global technological dominance. This year proved to be a pivotal chapter in the ongoing ‘AI race,’ with every move by industry giants and government bodies sending ripples across the globe. How is Intel Reshaping its Future in the US Semiconductor Market ? For a legacy giant like Intel , 2025 was a year of profound introspection and aggressive restructuring. Under the new leadership of CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took the helm in March, the company immediately signaled a decisive shift towards becoming an ‘engineering-focused company’ once again. Tan, a seasoned industry veteran and former board member, wasted no time implementing his vision, initiating a series of bold, albeit challenging, strategic moves designed to revitalize the company’s core: New Leadership Appointments: In June, Intel announced several high-profile engineering hires and a new chief revenue officer, reinforcing its commitment to technical excellence and market penetration. Significant Layoffs: Rumors from April materialized into reality in June, as Intel began laying off a substantial portion of its Intel Foundry staff, with plans to eliminate 15% to 20% of workers in that business unit by July. These layoffs were part of Tan’s strategy to ‘flatten the organization’ and reduce operational redundancies. Manufacturing Consolidation: A major announcement in July confirmed Intel was pulling back on some of its previously ambitious manufacturing operations. Projects in Germany and Poland were halted, and test operations were consolidated, indicating a strategic pivot towards efficiency and optimized resource allocation rather than broad expansion. The company also set a target to end the year with around 75,000 employees, reflecting a leaner operational model. Potential Asset Offloading: In May, reports surfaced that Intel was exploring spinning off non-core business units, specifically its networking and edge units, which contributed significantly to its 2024 revenue. This move aligns with Tan’s focus on streamlining operations and concentrating on core semiconductor innovation. Ohio Plant Delay: A setback occurred in February, with the delay of Intel’s $28 billion chip fabrication plant in Ohio for the second time. Construction is now not expected to wrap up until 2030, with operations potentially starting in 2031, highlighting the immense capital and time commitment involved in advanced manufacturing. These actions demonstrate Intel ‘s fierce determination to regain its competitive edge in the highly dynamic US semiconductor market , especially as the demand for high-performance chips for AI applications continues to soar. What Challenges Do AI Chip Export Restrictions Pose? The year 2025 was dominated by an evolving and often contentious debate around AI chip export restrictions , reflecting deep national security concerns and the fierce competition for technological supremacy between the U.S. and China. The regulatory landscape shifted dramatically, creating uncertainty and significant financial implications for leading semiconductor firms: Biden’s Sweeping Proposal (January): Just days before leaving office, former President Joe Biden proposed a comprehensive three-tier structure for U.S.-made AI chip exports. This framework aimed to control chip purchases by countries based on their perceived risk, with Tier 1 facing no restrictions, Tier 2 facing new limits, and Tier 3 facing additional stringent controls. A Last-Minute Reversal (May): Despite Biden’s proposal, the Trump administration, upon taking office, chose a different path. The ‘Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion’ was formally rescinded by the U.S. Department of Commerce in May, with promises of new guidance to come. However, the DOC reiterated that using Huawei’s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world remained a violation of U.S. export rules, signaling continued vigilance. Trump’s AI Action Plan (July): The Trump administration unveiled its own AI Action Plan, emphasizing the need for U.S. chip export controls and coordination with allies. While the plan lacked concrete details on restrictions, it reinforced the strategic importance of controlling advanced semiconductor technology. Increased Licensing Requirements (April): Nvidia ‘s H20 AI chips , designed for the Chinese market, were hit with new export licensing requirements.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, the Federal Reserve’s actions, heavily influenced by its chairman, hold immense sway. Recently, a significant piece of news emerged that provides a crucial sense of continuity: Jerome Powell , the current Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, has reportedly informed his colleagues that he has no intention of resigning. This update, initially shared by Watcher Guru via X, signals a period of continued leadership at the helm of America’s central bank, and its implications for the economy, inflation, and indeed, the volatile crypto markets, are worth a closer look. What’s the Buzz About Jerome Powell’s Stance? The financial community has been buzzing with speculation regarding the future of leadership at the Federal Reserve. The Fed’s decisions on interest rates and monetary policy profoundly impact everything from mortgage rates to stock market valuations and, crucially, the flow of capital into risk assets like cryptocurrencies. When there’s uncertainty at the top, markets tend to react with apprehension. The confirmation that Jerome Powell intends to complete his term brings a degree of predictability to the economic outlook. This isn’t just a simple personnel announcement; it’s a signal of consistency in a period marked by significant economic challenges, including persistent inflation and concerns about economic growth. For investors, this means they can likely anticipate a continuation of the Fed’s current policy trajectory, which has been focused on bringing inflation down to its 2% target without causing an undue recession. Stability Signal: Powell’s decision offers a steady hand in guiding monetary policy. Market Confidence: Reduces uncertainty, potentially fostering more stable market conditions. Policy Continuity: Suggests the current inflation-fighting strategy will persist. Decoding the Federal Reserve’s Role and Jerome Powell’s Leadership To fully grasp the weight of Jerome Powell’s decision, it’s essential to understand the Federal Reserve’s pivotal role. The Fed acts as the central bank of the United States, tasked with a dual mandate: Maximum Employment: Striving for the lowest unemployment rate consistent with price stability. Price Stability: Keeping inflation at a manageable and predictable level (typically around 2%). Under Powell’s leadership, which began in February 2018, the Fed has navigated several unprecedented economic events. From the swift interest rate cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic to the aggressive rate hikes initiated in 2022 to combat soaring inflation, Powell’s tenure has been defined by decisive, albeit sometimes controversial, actions. His approach has often emphasized data-driven decisions, with a clear focus on the inflation fight, even if it means tightening financial conditions. The Fed employs several tools to achieve its mandate: Federal Funds Rate: The primary tool, influencing borrowing costs across the economy. Quantitative Easing (QE) / Quantitative Tightening (QT): Buying or selling government bonds to inject or withdraw liquidity from the financial system. Bank Reserve Requirements: Though less frequently used, these dictate how much money banks must hold in reserve. Powell’s continuity means that the architect of the current economic strategy remains in place, suggesting that the existing framework for addressing inflation and managing economic growth will largely be maintained. How Does Jerome Powell’s Continuity Impact Monetary Policy? The decision by Jerome Powell to remain at the helm carries significant implications for the direction of U.S. monetary policy. A change in leadership could introduce new philosophies, potentially altering the Fed’s approach to inflation, employment, and financial stability. Powell’s continuity, however, suggests a steady hand on the tiller. Here’s what his continued tenure likely means for monetary policy: Aspect of Policy Impact of Powell’s Continuity Alternative (New Leadership) Inflation Target Continued commitment to the 2% target, with a willingness to maintain restrictive policy until achieved. Potentially a re-evaluation of the target or a more dovish/hawkish stance. Interest Rates Likely a data-dependent approach, with further hikes or cuts contingent on inflation and employment data. Predictability in the rate path. Uncertainty regarding future rate trajectory, potentially more volatile market reactions. Quantitative Tightening (QT) Continuation of balance sheet reduction, aiming to drain excess liquidity from the system. Possible acceleration or deceleration of QT, depending on new leadership’s views.

How Does Jerome Powell’s Continuity Impact Monetary Policy? The decision by Jerome Powell to remain at the helm carries significant implications for the direction of U.S. monetary policy. A change in leadership could introduce new philosophies, potentially altering the Fed’s approach to inflation, employment, and financial stability. Powell’s continuity, however, suggests a steady hand on the tiller. Here’s what his continued tenure likely means for monetary policy: Aspect of Policy Impact of Powell’s Continuity Alternative (New Leadership) Inflation Target Continued commitment to the 2% target, with a willingness to maintain restrictive policy until achieved. Potentially a re-evaluation of the target or a more dovish/hawkish stance. Interest Rates Likely a data-dependent approach, with further hikes or cuts contingent on inflation and employment data. Predictability in the rate path. Uncertainty regarding future rate trajectory, potentially more volatile market reactions. Quantitative Tightening (QT) Continuation of balance sheet reduction, aiming to drain excess liquidity from the system. Possible acceleration or deceleration of QT, depending on new leadership’s views. Communication Consistent communication style, providing clear guidance on the Fed’s intentions and econo"

2025-07-25 18:00:12+00:00,Ethereum Rising: Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz Predicts ETH Will Outperform BTC – Here’s Why,"After a notable bounce that took place earlier this month, Ethereum, the second-largest digital asset, is surging once again towards the key $4,000 price level. When the altcoin reclaims this level with the current bullish momentum, it is likely to witness a major rally, with popular figures predicting it could outperform Bitcoin this cycle. Galaxy CEO Banking On Ethereum Over Bitcoin Bitcoin, the flagship asset, may have witnessed a significant upward performance, reaching a new all-time high, but some prominent figures in the crypto market are betting more on Ethereum than BTC. Mike Novogratz , the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Galaxy Digital, has expressed optimism toward ETH, as he foresees a major rally in the short term. The long-term crypto advocate and billionaire has made a bold prediction, stating that Ethereum has a real shot at outperforming Bitcoin in this cycle. Although Bitcoin is still the most popular cryptocurrency store of value, ETH may outperform it due to its growing ecosystem and technological advancements. In the interview on CBNC Squawk Box, Novogratz asserted that he is a big believer in ETH and BTC, and he holds the two leading crypto assets. When asked which coin he would buy between the two, the investor expressed confidence in ETH, stating the altcoin is “caught up a lot” in the ongoing cycle. According to Novogratz, Ethereum seems likely to hit the $4,000 resistance level a few times before breaking past it. Meanwhile, if Ethereum takes out the crucial $4,000 mark, the investor believes the altcoin might enter a price discovery phase, which would lead to a major rally. Novogratz’s strong interest and optimism toward Ethereum rely on its narrative, which the investor claims is very powerful, while the market is extremely short-term. He also drew attention to the ongoing significant adoption of ETH by major treasury companies. Presently, two major treasury companies have accumulated the altcoin in large quantities, and another big treasury firm could be joining the race. This surge in institutional accumulation underscores a broader shift in how traditional markets view Ethereum . With these big companies purchasing ETH rapidly in large quantities, its available supply is drying up fast, which is mostly good for the price. Considering this supply shrink, the billionaire believes that ETH has a high likelihood of outpacing BTC in the next 3 to 6 months. Risk Of Short-Term Correction Remains Even though ETH seems poised for a rally , Crypto Dan, a market expert, has warned that the risk of a short-term correction still lingers, citing an overheating market. However, from a somewhat larger perspective, the current level is far too low when compared to the overheated futures market in March 2024 and November 2024. Should a correction occur, the expert stated that it will probably be brief and shallow, which represents a healthy pullback before a major rally. Despite being in an upcycle, ETH hit an undervalued zone and clearly touched the bottom, suggesting that the altcoin is likely to push toward even higher prices in the second half of 2025.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-will-outperform-bitcoin/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA,Ethereum|Altcoin|bitcoin|btc|CBNC Squawk Box|Crypto Dan|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Galaxy Digital|mike novogratz,BTC,"Ethereum Rising: Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz Predicts ETH Will Outperform BTC – Here’s Why.

2025-07-25 18:04:43+00:00,"Ripple''s lost 32,569 ledgers continues to feed conspiracy theories","Ripple’s earliest ledger data from its June 2012 launch is irretrievably incomplete due to a server bug that erased the headers for the first 32,569 ledgers. The significant gap in the XRP Ledger’s transaction history has the community asking where the pre-mined 100 billion XRP went. Ripple’s CTO David Schwartz addressed the incident in a 2012 Bitcoin forum post, stating, “Unfortunately, due to a server bug, some history was lost. You can’t trace all the way back to the genesis ledger. You can trace back to ledger 32,570.” However, questions continue to arise from time to time, especially in the wake of recent XRP sales by Ripple’s co-founder, Chris Larsen. Are Ripple’s early ledgers recoverable? Transactional content from the early ledgers still exists. Still, missing headers and metadata that link each ledger to the one before it break the cryptographic chain that verifies the integrity of blockchain records. Ripple Forum discussion of David Schwartz’s message on the deleted ledgers. Source: Forum.ripple.com According to a discussion among Ripple devs seen on the forum, developers and independent validators cannot fully reconstruct or authenticate the earliest 534 transactions on the XRP Ledger without those headers. XRP, like other blockchain systems, uses the hash of each preceding ledger to validate the next. The absence of those foundational links means that all current users of the XRP Ledger must accept the existing records on faith, trusting the individuals who operated the network during its first seven months. Do the lost ledgers matter? The period from June to December 2012 contains the most significant activity in XRP’s history, the pre-mining and initial distribution of all XRP coins. Unlike Bitcoin, which issues coins through mining, XRP’s 100 billion tokens were pre-mined by Ripple’s founders and distributed manually. Of those, 80% were allocated to Ripple companies to fund ongoing development, while the remaining 20% was retained by the founders themselves. The fact that these transactions lie within the now-unverifiable segment of the XRP Ledger is telling, and so far, none of the executives at Ripple have given a clear response on whether anything is being done to recover the ledgers. My favorite fact about $XRP is that the entire first week is missing from the ledger history and this is considered completely normal So 32569 ledgers (read: blocks) were lost forever and there''s hundreds of Billion of Dollars of supply which u can''t determine origin https://t.co/7TsGCF5nFp pic.twitter.com/NdWyiCSOBK — Wazz (@WazzCrypto) July 24, 2025 In a forum post from 2012, a Ripple developer conceded that backtracking through the ledger chain was nearly impossible. “There is no real way to trace back from 32,570, unfortunately,” they wrote. “32,569 contains the hash of 32,568 and that is definitely a much harder target to brute force.” Despite this, Ripple insiders insist that the situation is not as dire as it seems. “All history after the beta was opened is available,” Schwartz wrote in 2012. “All that was lost was the ledger headers, all the transactions are still available, so there’s some hope that the history may still be recovered.” Ripple can try reconstructing history, if it’s not impossible Although XRPL technical officers have reportedly been trying to recover or reconstruct the lost ledger headers over the years, they have not been successful. The main clue to the lost history is the header hash of ledger 32,569: 60A01EBF11537D8394EA1235253293508BDA7131D5F8710EFE9413AA129653A2, which is embedded in the verifiable header of ledger 32,570. According to developers, it is “problematic” to identify where individual transactions belong, especially if they lack metadata specifying their original ledger height. A brute-force approach to rebuilding the header chain would require substantial computational resources, alongside knowledge of how those early transactions were formatted. “Depending on how these old transactions are stored, it might be hard to find out in which exact ledger they were actually recorded,” one XRPL developer noted in a historical forum thread. “Still, if these old transactions don’t include their ledger height, there might be quite a bit more guesswork, or brute force, required.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-25 18:25:11+00:00,Colossal Bitcoin Whale Transfer: A Mysterious $899 Million Move From Coinbase,"BitcoinWorld Colossal Bitcoin Whale Transfer: A Mysterious $899 Million Move From Coinbase The cryptocurrency world thrives on transparency, yet moments of profound mystery often capture its collective imagination. Recently, a colossal event sent ripples across the digital asset landscape: a monumental Bitcoin whale transfer . This isn’t just any transaction; it involves a staggering 7,743 BTC, valued at approximately $899 million, moving from the prominent exchange Coinbase to an entirely unknown new wallet. Such a significant shift immediately begs questions and ignites speculation among investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. What does such a massive move signify for the market? Is it a strategic play by a major institution, a security measure, or something else entirely? Let’s dive deep into this intriguing event and unravel its potential implications. What Exactly Happened with This Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The news broke courtesy of Whale Alert , a popular blockchain tracking service renowned for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report highlighted the transfer of 7,743 BTC from a Coinbase wallet to an address that has no public association, making it an ‘unknown new wallet.’ The sheer scale of this transaction—nearing a billion dollars—makes it one of the most significant single movements of Bitcoin in recent times. This particular Bitcoin whale transfer originated from a known exchange, adding another layer of intrigue. To put the scale into perspective, consider these points: Volume: 7,743 BTC represents a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, though still a small percentage overall. Value: At approximately $899 million, this transfer underscores the immense wealth held by Bitcoin’s largest holders. Origin: Moving from Coinbase, one of the world’s largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges, suggests a deliberate and perhaps strategic action rather than a random occurrence. Destination: An ‘unknown new wallet’ means the recipient’s identity remains anonymous, fueling speculation about their intentions. Why Do Bitcoin Whale Transfers Send Ripples Through the Market? In the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies, large holders, often dubbed ‘whales,’ wield significant influence. Their movements are meticulously watched because they can often precede major price swings or shifts in market sentiment. A Bitcoin whale transfer of this magnitude is akin to a giant ship changing course in the ocean; it creates waves that affect smaller vessels. Here’s why these transfers are so closely monitored: Potential Price Impact: If the Bitcoin is moved to an exchange, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, if moved to cold storage, it might indicate long-term holding, reducing available supply and potentially supporting prices. Market Sentiment: Large transfers can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) if perceived as a prelude to selling, or inspire confidence if seen as accumulation. Liquidity Implications: A significant withdrawal from an exchange like Coinbase impacts its liquidity, even if temporarily. Insight into Major Players: While identities remain unknown, such transfers offer a glimpse into the activities of major market participants, whose moves are often considered highly strategic. The Enigma of the Unknown Wallet: Who’s Behind This Colossal Bitcoin Whale Transfer? The most captivating aspect of this event is the destination: an unknown new wallet. This anonymity opens the door to numerous theories. While we can only speculate, some common possibilities for such a significant Bitcoin whale transfer include: Institutional OTC (Over-The-Counter) Deal: Large institutions often prefer OTC desks for buying or selling massive amounts of crypto to avoid impacting exchange order books. This transfer could be part of an OTC transaction where the buyer is taking custody. Cold Storage for Long-Term Holding: A whale might be moving their assets from an exchange to a secure, offline cold storage wallet for enhanced security and a long-term holding strategy. This suggests bullish sentiment. Internal Reorganization: Large entities, including exchanges or investment funds, might conduct internal transfers to consolidate assets, rebalance portfolios, or move funds between different operational wallets. Preparation for a Major Sale: While less likely to an unknown new wallet directly, the funds could be destined for a series of smaller sales or another platform for a structured exit. Custodial Services: A large client of Coinbase Custody might be moving their assets to a new, private custodial solution or another secure storage arrangement. Without further on-chain activity or official statements, the true intent behind this specific Bitcoin whale transfer remains shrouded in mystery, adding to the allure of the decentralized financial landscape.

2025-07-25 18:35:07+00:00,"CQ CEO Backtracks on BTC Cycle Theory, Now Cites Institutional Surge","CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju has declared that the long-standing Bitcoin (BTC) cycle theory is “dead,” and has issued a public apology for his earlier bearish predictions. Ju, once a proponent of cycle-based forecasting, where he advocated buying when whales accumulate and selling when retail floods in, acknowledged that “the pattern no longer holds” amid a structural transformation led by institutional investors. The Death of the Bitcoin Cycle Theory In a July 25 post on X, Ju explained that old whales are selling to new long-term whales, adding that holders now outnumber traders and traditional trading strategies now feel “pointless.” “My mistake was ignoring this shift in my ‘bull cycle is over’ call,” wrote the CQ founder. “I sincerely apologize if my prediction impacted your investment. I’ll be more careful with forecasts and focus on providing data-driven insights.” For years, BTC’s price movements followed a familiar rhythm: whales accumulated early, retail FOMO kicked in near the top, and a bear market ensued. However, CryptoQuant’s latest on-chain analysis supports Ju’s new stance. The report shows that in contrast to past cycles where retail investors dominated euphoric peaks, today’s rally is characterized by their absence. Retail selling has intensified, particularly on platforms like Binance, where inflows from small traders surged from $12 billion to $16 billion over the past month. Instead, it’s deep-pocketed investors, institutions, high-volume wallets, and ETFs that are aggressively accumulating. Whales Screener data from earlier in the week supports this, showing over $200 million in BTC was withdrawn from exchanges in one 24-hour period to signal long-term conviction further. Google Trends has also shown muted retail interest, a stark contrast to the social media frenzy of 2021. “This cycle looks nothing like the madness of 2021,” CryptoQuant noted. “Quiet and smart money is currently on stage.” Last year, Stockmoney Lizards, another prominent analyst account, made observations similar to Ju’s. They argued this current cycle “marks the beginning of something different,” with Wall Street and TradFi institutions entering the market in droves. “Mass adoption has started,” they claimed, suggesting future BTC market behavior may resemble the S&P 500 more than the boom-bust patterns of days gone by. A Few Believers Remain However, not everyone agrees. On July 16, pseudonymous analyst CryptoCon pushed back against the growing debate over Bitcoin’s future trajectory, asserting that the four-year halving cycle is still intact. “People expect the 4-year cycle to die every time. It hasn’t,” they said, projecting a cycle top between October and December 2025. Amid the debate, BTC is trading at $115,500, a 2.5% dip in the last 24 hours and a 4.7% decline over the past week. This means it is underperforming the broader crypto market, which is down just 1.5% in that period. The flagship cryptocurrency is now 6.2% below its all-time high set on July 14, though it remains up 8.6% in the last 30 days and nearly 80% year-on-year.

2025-07-25 18:36:48+00:00,Revolut restores some crypto service in Hungary,"Leading European neobank Revolut has reinstated some of its cryptocurrency services in Hungary, which were suspended after Budapest introduced criminal liability for unauthorized transactions with digital assets. Hungarian users of its app can now transfer their coins to other wallets, something they were unable to do until recently. The company had decided to temporarily halt withdrawals, among other operations, in the face of harsh penalties. Revolut resumes some services in Hungary London-headquartered fintech giant Revolut has partially restored its crypto-related services for Hungarian customers, most notably the option to send over 30 supported tokens to external wallets. This applies to previously deposited assets, as new deposits remain suspended. The move comes after the platform stopped all its crypto features earlier this month, following the adoption of highly restrictive rules by the parliament in Budapest this past June, the English-language portal Hungary Today reported, quoting the business news outlet Portfolio.hu. The new legislation, which went into force on July 1, threatens to punish both businesses and their clients for using or offering crypto services without national licensing. That’s regardless of whether a provider has been licensed in another EU jurisdiction. Under its provisions, private individuals may get up to five years in prison for breaking the law, and operators of crypto platforms face up to eight years behind bars, depending on the value of the transactions they have processed. Arguably, as a precaution, Revolut opted to freeze all crypto functions of its popular banking app, among which are buying, selling, depositing, staking, and even withdrawals. “As of mid-July, withdrawals were re-enabled, and now staking-related features have been restored as well,” Hungary Today highlighted. In a letter to its Hungarian customers, quoted by Portfolio.hu, Revolut wrote: “We are pleased to announce that our staking services are available again.” The fintech firm is also allowing users to access depositing, releasing, and staking rewards through its application, the Hungarian media reported in detail. Key crypto features remain suspended When Revolut announced it’s halting cryptocurrency-related services, it made it clear this is directly related to the recently introduced changes in Hungarian law. It also noted the measure will be in place until further notice, stating: “Unfortunately, we cannot give an exact date when the services will be available again, but as soon as this happens, we will notify you immediately.” The current recovery is only partial, though, as key features such as buying, selling, and receiving crypto, as well as new deposits, remain suspended for the time being. In another notice , Revolut informed Hungarians that it has updated its crypto registration process for new customers: “Due to changes in EU legislation, we temporarily suspend the registration of new crypto customers in some countries. This step was taken as a preparation for the new regulation on the cryptocurrency market (MiCA).” At this point, the U.K.-based company is still pursuing licensing under MiCA, the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto Assets regulation. “As our request for our MiCA license is still in progress, we have decided to pause new registrations to minimize regulatory risk and meet local requirements during the transition period,” the neobank explained. It also pointed out that, besides Hungary, the break applies to all newly opened retail, Revolut X, and Business crypto accounts in the Netherlands, Finland, Latvia, and Slovenia as well. The rules that Budapest is imposing on crypto firms and users are much harsher than what Brussels requires. Members of the crypto community in another Central European nation, Poland , which happens to be the region’s largest market for digital assets, have also expressed concerns about their upcoming regulations.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the scheme involved Christina Chapman of Litchfield Park, AZ, hosting a “laptop farm” to assist DPRK hackers in posing as IT workers and stealing over $17 million from 309 US companies. Chapman’s laptop farm was first seized in 2023. In February of this year, she pleaded guilty to using over 90 computers to receive, host and deceive US companies into hiring North Korean hackers using false, stolen or borrowed US citizen identities. According to court documents, the scheme generated over $17 million for the North Korean government. Some of the duped companies even included Fortune 500 firms. Assistant Director Rozhavsky of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division warns against the reality of where North Korean hacked funds are heading: “The North Korean regime has generated millions of dollars for its nuclear weapons program by victimizing American citizens, businesses, and financial institutions. However, even an adversary as sophisticated as the North Korean government can’t succeed without the assistance of willing US citizens like Christina Chapman, who was sentenced today for her role in an elaborate scheme to defraud more than 300 American companies by helping North Korean IT workers gain virtual employment and launder the money they earned. Today’s sentencing demonstrates that the FBI will work tirelessly with our partners to defend the homeland and hold those accountable who aid our adversaries.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In February of this year, she pleaded guilty to using over 90 computers to receive, host and deceive US companies into hiring North Korean hackers using false, stolen or borrowed US citizen identities. According to court documents, the scheme generated over $17 million for the North Korean government. Some of the duped companies even included Fortune 500 firms. Assistant Director Rozhavsky of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division warns against the reality of where North Korean hacked funds are heading: “The North Korean regime has generated millions of dollars for its nuclear weapons program by victimizing American citizens, businesses, and financial institutions. However, even an adversary as sophisticated as the North Korean government can’t succeed without the assistance of willing US citizens like Christina Chapman, who was sentenced today for her role in an elaborate scheme to defraud more than 300 American companies by helping North Korean IT workers gain virtual employment and launder the money they earned. Today’s sentencing demonstrates that the FBI will work tirelessly with our partners to defend the homeland and hold those accountable who aid our adversaries.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The cybersecurity firm Akamai Technologies says that it has confirmed the first case of a new variant of the Coyote banking trojan maliciously using Microsoft’s UI Automation (UIA) framework “in the wild.” Says Akamai security researcher Tomer Peled, “Coyote now leverages UIA as part of its operation. Like any other banking trojan, Coyote is hunting banking information, but what sets Coyote apart is the way it obtains this information, which involves the (ab)use of UIA.” Peled says that the new variant is targeting Brazilian users by using UIA to “extract credentials linked to 75 banking institutes’ web addresses and cryptocurrency exchanges.” “Coyote can perform checks, regardless of whether the malware is online or operating in an offline mode. This increases the chances of successfully identifying a victim’s bank or crypto exchange and stealing their credentials. UIA provides several things for an attacker, including a simple solution for malware developers to parse sub-elements of another application.” The Coyote malware family was first discovered in February 2024, when it was targeting mostly Latin America. “Coyote is a trojan malware that employs various malicious techniques, such as keylogging and phishing overlays, to steal banking information. It uses the Squirrel installer to propagate (hence the name ‘Coyote,’ which pays homage to the coyotes’ nature to hunt squirrels). In one of its most well-known campaigns, Coyote targeted Brazilian companies in an attempt to deploy an information stealing Remote Access Trojan within their systems.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Bitcoin Open Interest Has Gone Against The Price Trend As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin Open Interest has witnessed a sharp surge alongside the latest decline in the price. The “Open Interest” here refers to an indicator that measures the total amount of positions related to BTC (in USD) that are currently open on all centralized derivatives exchanges. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Often Flags Turning Points—What’s It Saying Now? When the value of this metric rises, it means the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when new positions appear, so this kind of trend can lead to more volatility for the cryptocurrency. On the other hand, the indicator going down suggests the holders are either closing up positions of their own volition or getting liquidated by their platform. Whatever the case be, the asset’s price can behave in a more stable manner after such a trend. Now, here is a chart that shows how the value of the Bitcoin Open Interest has changed over the last month: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest rose to a high value earlier in the month when the asset’s rally to the new all-time high (ATH) took place. This wasn’t anything unusual, as speculation tends to flood in during periods of exciting price action. As BTC retraced from its peak and settled into a phase of boring consolidation, the metric’s value calmed down a bit. Now, the coin has finally diverged from this sideways movement, showing a downwards move. Interestingly, the Open Interest has rocketed up alongside this price plunge and set a new record around $44.5 billion. From the chart, it’s visible that price declines usually accompany drawdowns in the indicator, as longs find liquidation. “It’s unusual for BTC price direction and open interest to move in a negative correlation,” notes the quant. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $1 Billion As XRP, Dogecoin Crash 10% The spike in the metric could suggest some longs have decided to double down on their bets and some speculators have jumped in to get their shorts in, expecting the downtrend to continue. As mentioned before, an increase in the metric can amplify price volatility. This happens because the chances of a mass liquidation event taking place go up during such conditions. It now remains to be seen how this Open Interest increase would unwind this time around and whether a long squeeze or a short one would take place.

2025-07-25 19:00:58+00:00,XRP Should Be Worth $30 Today Based on This Bitcoin Comparison,"In a recent X post, prominent crypto commentator Amonyx reignited a long-standing debate by stating that XRP should be trading at over $30 based on its historical ratio to Bitcoin. The argument hinges on a comparison from 2018, when XRP peaked at approximately 0.00026 BTC. With Bitcoin now trading around $117,800, a simple multiplication of that ratio would imply that XRP should be worth over $30. However, despite a strong performance in recent weeks, XRP is still trading far below that theoretical target. XRP-Bitcoin Ratio from 2018 In early 2018, XRP experienced a euphoric rally, briefly surging to a Bitcoin-denominated price of about 0.0002247 BTC, which aligns closely with the 0.00026 BTC figure referenced by Amonyx. At that time, the entire crypto market was riding a speculative wave, and XRP had become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The XRP/BTC ratio, however, was more a product of hype and less an indication of sustainable value or utility. Fast forward to 2025, and the market dynamics have changed drastically. Bitcoin has soared to above $117,000, but XRP’s current value remains around $3.06, a far cry from the $30 that the 2018 ratio would suggest. In 2018, $XRP peaked at 0.00026 BTC. Now that BTC is at $117,800, XRP should be worth $30+. But it’s still crawling… — Amonyx (@amonbuy) July 25, 2025 Current Price Performance and Market Conditions As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.06, down slightly from its recent all-time high of $3.66. This new peak surpassed its 2018 high of around $3.40, marking a significant milestone in XRP’s performance. When compared to Bitcoin’s meteoric rise, XRP appears to be lagging. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong, and altcoins like XRP, while rallying, are not keeping pace on a BTC-relative basis. There are several reasons for this disparity. In 2018, XRP’s rise was largely speculative, driven by hopes that Ripple’s payment technologies would see swift global adoption. In contrast, the 2025 market is more mature, with increased regulatory scrutiny, institutional involvement , and clearer utility expectations for digital assets. XRP’s adoption is growing, particularly with developments around Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and new enterprise partnerships, but these advances have not yet translated into a BTC-equivalent price surge. Why XRP Isn’t Trading at $30 Despite Historical Projections The assumption that XRP should mirror its 2018 BTC ratio fails to account for how both assets have evolved. Bitcoin has become a globally recognized store of value, institutional asset, and hedge against macro uncertainty. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Its rise is driven by deep liquidity and global demand. XRP, on the other hand, remains a payment-focused asset with unique regulatory and technological hurdles. While XRP’s ecosystem is expanding, including growing transaction volume and utility through the XRP Ledger and Hooks amendments, its pace of institutional adoption is markedly slower than Bitcoin’s. Moreover, the speculative nature of the 2018 XRP/BTC ratio was unsustainable. Today’s pricing reflects a more grounded valuation based on real-world utility, network growth, and regulatory progress. Analysts now favor models that assess XRP independently, rather than tying its fate to past correlations with Bitcoin. Forecasts from leading firms suggest XRP could reach $7 to $15 over the next 12 to 18 months, but few see a realistic path to $30 unless new catalysts emerge. Amonyx’s argument is grounded in historical data, but market conditions have shifted dramatically since XRP’s 2018 peak against Bitcoin. While the math suggests XRP should be worth over $30 today, the market tells a different story. At $3.06, XRP is performing strongly in 2025, especially considering recent regulatory clarity and adoption milestones. However, the days of comparing altcoins strictly against Bitcoin ratios may be behind us, as each asset now follows its path defined by utility, compliance, and investor demand.

The California-based Healthcare Triangle Inc. (HCTI) erupted 400% in just five days after the Nasdaq Hearings Panel decided to let the company remain on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Healthcare Triangle bills itself as a top provider of cloud and data transformation solutions in the healthcare and life science sectors, certified by the information security framework HITRUST. The nano cap stock began the week at $0.016, reaching a high of $.08 on Friday. HCTI is now trading at $0.07 at time of publishing. The Nasdaq will allow the stock to continue trading as long as the company executes a reverse stock split within two weeks. At that point, HCTI will need to close at $1.00 or more for 20 trading days in a row by September 5th. The stock now has a market cap of just over $30 million after reporting a 10% revenue decline in Q1 at $3.7 million. The drop was triggered by lower demand for the company’s services across the board, with the firm’s five largest clients accounting for 57% of total revenue.

Since its inception, the donation initiative has collected $67.3 million, an amount that is dwarfed by the sheer size of the federal debt. Debt surged nearly 90% since 2010 The current US national debt has surged by 87% since 2010, when it stood at $19.59 trillion. The Treasury Department has warned that ballooning deficits have placed America’s fiscal sustainability at risk. According to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, the total debt grew at nearly $55,000 every second over the past year alone. The donations may be entirely voluntary, but in the eyes of naysayers, those individual contributions, regardless of how many, cannot significantly alter the country’s downward looking fiscal trajectory. “If every American donated $1,000 right now, it still wouldn’t make a meaningful dent,” said Shawn French, host of “The Determined Society” podcast. “This feels more like desperation than strategy.” French said the US government’s plea is “a massive distraction” and “a last-ditch attempt” of asking the public to help bring down the debt, but the current administration does not have any viable structural reforms. Samson Mow, CEO of Bitcoin technology firm JAN3, compared the program to “sending Bitcoin to a burn address,” an irreversible crypto transaction that results in token destruction. The Treasury reiterated that the donation option is a chance for patriotic individuals to contribute to “Making America Great Again,” no matter how small the impact may be on the overall balance sheet. Trump’s ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ adds trillions to debt The recently passed and signed legislation backed by President Donald Trump, referred to as the “Big, Beautiful Bill,” is expected to increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade, according to projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). A contentious element of the now-passed law was the decision to raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, which several economic commentators, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, were loudly unhappy about. The billionaire entrepreneur coined the law as “fiscally reckless.” The Congressional Budget Office revealed on Monday that more than 10 million Americans will be uninsured under the provisions of the new law by 2034. This figure is a slight improvement over earlier projections that estimated 11.8 million would lose health coverage over the next decade. “Today’s report reminds us of something: facts are stubborn and the facts are clear,” remarked Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer. “The big, ugly betrayal is a loser for the country and will be a loser for the Republicans.” Conservative lawmakers have continued to defend the legislation, claiming it was necessary to pass it to prevent tax increases for millions of Americans. Supporters believe the US economy will outperform the CBO’s projections, generating greater tax revenues to narrow the deficit. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Last Time Bitcoin Price Had Exploded,"US President Donald Trump said today that some Americans may receive “stimulus checks” from tariff revenues collected this year. While this proposal represents a form of compensation for consumers affected by high prices, it has also raised concerns that it could trigger a new wave of inflation. “There''s so much money coming in that we''re considering a small refund,” Trump told reporters outside the White House. “A small refund for people at a certain income level would be very nice,” he said. According to Treasury Department data, the US government collected more than $100 billion in tariff revenue in the first half of the year. This figure is expected to exceed $27 billion in July.

2025-07-25 19:51:29+00:00,"Meme Coin Traders Pour Into Viral Newcomer Below $0.002 as Bitcoin (BTC) Eyes Move Toward $140,000","Bitcoin is back in the spotlight, climbing past $118,000 and threatening to push even higher. Bulls aren''t stepping away after touching $123K and cooling off just yet. Analysts at CryptoQuant have flagged a technical window that could keep the rally alive a bit longer, suggesting BTC still has room to grow 20% to 25% before short-term holders begin heavy profit-taking. With BTC setting the pace, the question becomes: which altcoins are best positioned to ride that wave? Little Pepe Is Quietly Building a Meme-Era Juggernaut Every bull market has its meme moment; this cycle already shows signs of that energy shifting. Enter Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a new Ethereum Layer-2 meme coin that''s not just about internet culture; it''s building real infrastructure under the hood. It''s still early, but LILPEPE has already raised over $7.8 million in its presale, selling over 6 billion tokens and attracting a tidal wave of organic interest across Telegram, X, and emerging meme launchpads. Unlike most meme coins, this one runs on its own Ethereum-compatible Layer-2, purpose-built for low gas fees, sniper bot resistance, and meme-only launch tools like its Pump Pad. That technical backbone causes a pivot among degens and seasoned traders who''ve typically avoided meme assets. With zero-tax trading and a native ecosystem, LILPEPE is hitting the sweet spot between fun and function. Little Pepe''s presale has been nothing short of explosive. With each stage selling out faster than the last, the demand for $LILPEPE tokens has intensified as more users recognize the project''s long-term potential. That momentum has now carried into Stage 6, where tokens are available at $0.0015—a 7% increase from the previous stage. But it''s the timing that makes this more than a casual scroll. History shows meme coins tend to rip after Bitcoin has its run, especially when BTC breaks into new highs. And when the crowd rotates back into high-upside tokens with early-stage positioning, the ones with the strongest communities and cleanest tech run the hardest. So far, LILPEPE looks like the one everyone''s watching. Some early calls are placing their post-launch ceiling between $0.10 and $0.30, which would mean 20x to 50x returns from here, if the rollout delivers. It''s still early, but if the next meme season starts with Bitcoin at six figures, this Layer-2 joker might not stay under $0.002 for long. Why Traders Are Moving Capital Now Dogecoin is still out there. So is Shiba Inu. However, the truth is that legacy meme coins are starting to lose their first-mover advantage. SHIB''s charts have flattened, and DOGE hasn''t seen a meaningful new narrative in over a year. That''s leaving space for something fresh, something built for the current wave of traders. And that''s where LILPEPE fits in. It''s not just another frog; it has a strategy, a product pipeline, and most importantly, a community that shows up. That''s rare in this niche, which is why capital is shifting in this direction. What It All Means Bitcoin''s sudden increase in value towards $140,000 is influencing the entire crypto market. BTC is spearheading the recovery as the on-chain metrics show distinct improvements, macro sentiment is quite supportive, and there is renewed focus from institutions. But when Bitcoin moves, it rarely moves alone. Historically, such momentum at the top ignites a cascading wave across altcoins, particularly meme coins. As capital flows outward from BTC, the real percentage gains tend to emerge in smaller, high-upside assets. The Bottom Line Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is one of those rare meme coins built for that breakout moment. It''s not a recycled Doge or SHIB spin-off—it''s a Layer-2 with its lightweight blockchain, zero-tax trading, bot protection, and a meme-native launchpad ecosystem. Combined with a wildly successful presale that''s already raised $7.8 million and sold over 6 billion tokens, those features position it perfectly to ride the next altseason wave. So, while Bitcoin paves the road with institutional firepower, LILPEPE might be the coin darting ahead in the fast lane. At $0.0015, with CoinMarketCap visibility, 98% of present presale stage tokens are gone, and an engaged community is behind it, so the runway is wide open.

2025-07-25 19:55:36+00:00,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips As Massive Transfer Impacts Prices,"Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $115,000 during the ongoing session, dropping to a low of $114,770 thanks to Galaxy Digital moving a whopping 17,123 BTC, worth nearly $2 billion, to multiple centralized exchanges. Market sentiment also turned cautious ahead of the US Federal Reserve meeting and the release of a key crypto policy report. The flagship cryptocurrency is down nearly 2% during the ongoing session, trading around $116,548. Galaxy Digital Moves Bitcoin (BTC) To Centralized Exchanges Galaxy Digital has moved 17,123 BTC , worth nearly $2 billion, to multiple centralized exchanges in the past 12 hours. Blockchain intelligence platform Lookonchain noted that Galaxy Digital initially sent 10,000 BTC to exchanges in the past 8 hours. The transfer comes after the digital asset firm received 80,000 BTC from a Satoshi-era whale whose wallet was dormant for 14 years. Lookonchain stated on X, “Note that it has deposited over 10,000 ($1.18B) to exchanges in the past 8 hours! The 10,000+ comes from the Bitcoin OG holding 80,009 ($9.68B).” Galaxy Digital has withdrawn over 370 million USDT from centralized exchanges, including Bybit, OKX, and Binance. “Suspected to belong to the 14-year BTC fossil hand, 14,273 $BTC were deposited in batches into various exchanges by Galaxy Digital over the past 12 hours, valued at approximately $1.67 billion.” The selloff has impacted Bitcoin prices, with the flagship cryptocurrency registering a sharp correction over the past 24 hours, as it fell below $115,000 to a low of $114,770. The decline has rattled investors, with many questioning if BTC can continue pushing higher in the face of such substantial selling pressure. Strategy Launches New Preferred Stock To Build Bitcoin War Chest Michael Saylor’s Strategy has launched a new type of preferred stock and upsized it from $500 million to $2.8 billion. The security, which Strategy is calling Stretch, promises a 9% annual payout, with no end date attached. The deal is part of Saylor’s efforts to transform his software company into a financial juggernaut with one goal: to raise funds to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible. Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings are worth over $70 billion at current prices. Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University, stated, “This is not the first financial engineering initiative by Strategy. In any situation where your company is worth far more than its fundamental value, you raise money.” Strategy has issued various types of debt and layered stacks of preferred stocks. The company has pioneered the “Bitcoin treasury” strategy, with several other public companies adopting the Strategy’s approach. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted below $115,000 on Friday, falling to a low of $114,770, resulting in the liquidation of over half a billion dollars in long positions. According to data from Coinglass, $585 million in long positions was liquidated, with Bitcoin accounting for $140 million of the total. Crypto trader Ash Crypto noted in a post on X, “This dump is a pure leverage flush. Many people longed Alts after they saw ETH pumping hard, so market makers dumped and liquidated the late longs.” Despite the significant pullback, overall crypto market sentiment remains bullish, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index posting a “Greed” score of 70 on Friday. The pullback comes even as several crypto figures, including Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz, predicted higher prices for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC’s dip below $115,000 earlier in the session was prompted by the distribution of thousands of BTC to crypto exchanges by Galaxy Digital. The drop triggered a wave of liquidations, becoming the latest chapter in the saga of the 80,000 BTC , which were last moved 14 years ago. Lookonchain noted, “Bitcoin sell-off still underway! #GalaxyDigital deposited another 2,850 $BTC ($330.44M) to exchanges 11 minutes ago.” Despite the selloff, analysts stated that markets had not entered a state of panic. “I see the current state of the market as cautionary more than panic. Panic often has volume & considerable volatility, which we don''t have currently. Time to watch for sure though.” BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, surging past $120,000 and reaching a new all-time high of $123,091. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $115,701 before recovering to reclaim $117,000, settling at $117,682, ultimately registering a 1.70% decline. BTC rose on Wednesday, rising 0.82% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC rose 0.39% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,101. Selling pressure returned on Friday as the price fell 1,03%, dropping to a low of $116,805 before settling at $117,877.

The security, which Strategy is calling Stretch, promises a 9% annual payout, with no end date attached. The deal is part of Saylor’s efforts to transform his software company into a financial juggernaut with one goal: to raise funds to acquire as much Bitcoin as possible. Strategy’s Bitcoin holdings are worth over $70 billion at current prices. Campbell Harvey, a professor at Duke University, stated, “This is not the first financial engineering initiative by Strategy. In any situation where your company is worth far more than its fundamental value, you raise money.” Strategy has issued various types of debt and layered stacks of preferred stocks. The company has pioneered the “Bitcoin treasury” strategy, with several other public companies adopting the Strategy’s approach. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted below $115,000 on Friday, falling to a low of $114,770, resulting in the liquidation of over half a billion dollars in long positions. According to data from Coinglass, $585 million in long positions was liquidated, with Bitcoin accounting for $140 million of the total. Crypto trader Ash Crypto noted in a post on X, “This dump is a pure leverage flush. Many people longed Alts after they saw ETH pumping hard, so market makers dumped and liquidated the late longs.” Despite the significant pullback, overall crypto market sentiment remains bullish, with the Crypto Fear and Greed Index posting a “Greed” score of 70 on Friday. The pullback comes even as several crypto figures, including Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz, predicted higher prices for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. BTC’s dip below $115,000 earlier in the session was prompted by the distribution of thousands of BTC to crypto exchanges by Galaxy Digital. The drop triggered a wave of liquidations, becoming the latest chapter in the saga of the 80,000 BTC , which were last moved 14 years ago. Lookonchain noted, “Bitcoin sell-off still underway! #GalaxyDigital deposited another 2,850 $BTC ($330.44M) to exchanges 11 minutes ago.” Despite the selloff, analysts stated that markets had not entered a state of panic. “I see the current state of the market as cautionary more than panic. Panic often has volume & considerable volatility, which we don''t have currently. Time to watch for sure though.” BTC started the previous week on a bullish note, surging past $120,000 and reaching a new all-time high of $123,091. However, it lost momentum on Tuesday as traders locked in their profits. As a result, the price plunged to an intraday low of $115,701 before recovering to reclaim $117,000, settling at $117,682, ultimately registering a 1.70% decline. BTC rose on Wednesday, rising 0.82% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC rose 0.39% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,101. Selling pressure returned on Friday as the price fell 1,03%, dropping to a low of $116,805 before settling at $117,877.

2025-07-25 20:46:11+00:00,"Bitwise CIO Declares “Four-Year Crypto Cycle Is Dead”—Is a Steady, Record-Breaking Boom Next?","Bitwise Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan says the long-observed four-year crypto cycle may no longer apply to the current market. In a recent discussion with Bitcoin advocate Kyle Chassé and Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, Hougan argued that the historical pattern is breaking down, and a longer, more sustained growth phase could be on the horizon. Traditionally, crypto markets have followed a four-year rhythm driven by Bitcoin’s halving events, shifting interest rates, and the cyclical blow-ups that have rattled the industry. But Hougan believes these drivers are now losing influence. Matt Hougan Predicts ‘Sustained Boom’ for Crypto as Traditional Cycles Fade In a follow-up post on X , Hougan pointed to the diminishing impact of the Bitcoin halving , noting that each one has half the effect of the last. “The halving is half as important every four years,” he said. Why is the four-year cycle dead? 1) The forces that have created prior four-year cycles are weaker: i) The halving is half as important every four years; ii) The interest rate cycle is positive for crypto, not negative (as it was in 2018 and 2022); iii) Blow-up risk is… https://t.co/F9ybjHEeB5 — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) July 25, 2025 The rationale is simple: as block rewards diminish in absolute terms, their effect on overall market supply shrinks relative to the growing scale of the crypto economy. As such, halvings no longer serve as the singular driving force behind bullish market cycles. He also noted how interest rate cycles, once a severe headwind for crypto in downturns like 2018 and 2022, are now acting as tailwinds, buoyed by a more stable and accommodative macro environment. Hougan further emphasized that the risk of blowups, which had once controlled cycles in the crypto space, has been greatly reduced due to the shift to improved regulation and growing institutional involvement. In place of the old cycle, Hougan sees new forces taking hold, ones that move on longer timelines and aren’t tied to halving years. At the top of the list is the growing inflow of capital into crypto-related ETFs . That wave, which started in 2024 , is just beginning, he said, and could last five to ten years. Institutional adoption is another key trend. Hougan said pensions, endowments, and national account platforms are only starting to embrace crypto exposure. He expects that trend to accelerate as more crypto ETFs win approval. He also pointed to progress on the regulatory front. In his view, January 2025 marked the beginning of a new era of policymaking for the industry. Hougan cited the passage of the GENIUS Act earlier this month as a major shift. As GENIUS Act passes, regulatory paths stabilize across jurisdictions and digital assets may find stronger footing for long-term planning. #genius #stablecoin https://t.co/Hdq2wceITt — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 The legislation has opened the door for Wall Street to begin building financial products around crypto, he said, predicting that banks will invest billions over the coming years. In his post, Hougan added that new developments such as the rise of crypto treasury firms holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets are shaping a different kind of cycle. He believes these emerging patterns won’t follow the sharp booms and busts of the past. “I think it’s more of a sustained steady boom than a supercycle,” Hougan wrote. “The long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic four-year cycle forces.” Looking ahead, he believes 2026 will be a strong year for crypto, although he warned that volatility is still expected. Bitwise CIO Sees Bitcoin on Path to $1M Amid Policy Shifts and Growing Institutional Support This is not the first time Hougan has believed that Bitcoin has entered a new phase of institutional adoption, marked by major shifts in finance and policy. On December 13, 2024, Hougan pointed to several key developments signaling this shift : BlackRock’s suggested 2% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin, the rapid uptake of spot Bitcoin ETFs, and growing public support from financial leaders like Ray Dalio. He also noted the increasing political acceptance of crypto, noting President Donald Trump’s vocal backing of Bitcoin and his appearance at a major industry event .

2025-07-25 20:55:10+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Unleashed: BTC Soars Past $117,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Unleashed: BTC Soars Past $117,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with excitement as the Bitcoin price has once again defied expectations, surging past the significant $117,000 mark. This impressive rally has captured the attention of both seasoned investors and newcomers alike, sparking renewed optimism across the digital asset landscape. What exactly is fueling this remarkable ascent, and what does it mean for the future of the world’s leading cryptocurrency? What’s Driving the Bitcoin Price Surge Beyond $117,000? The recent monumental rise in Bitcoin price isn’t a random event; it’s the culmination of several powerful factors converging to create a bullish environment. Understanding these catalysts is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding crypto market. Institutional Inflows: A significant driver has been the continued influx of institutional capital. Major financial players, including hedge funds and corporations, are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class and a hedge against inflation. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various jurisdictions has further streamlined this process, making it easier for traditional investors to gain exposure without directly holding the asset. Halving Hype and Scarcity: The anticipation surrounding Bitcoin’s halving events continues to play a pivotal role. These programmed reductions in the reward for mining new blocks emphasize Bitcoin’s inherent scarcity. As the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market decreases, while demand potentially rises, the fundamental economics point towards upward price pressure. This narrative creates a strong psychological effect on the market. Macroeconomic Landscape: Global economic conditions, including concerns about inflation and the devaluation of fiat currencies, are pushing investors towards alternative stores of value. Bitcoin, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ offers a decentralized and limited supply asset that can potentially preserve wealth in uncertain times. Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Ongoing developments within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability solutions and increasing adoption of the Lightning Network, enhance its utility and efficiency. A more robust and user-friendly network naturally attracts more participants, bolstering confidence in its long-term viability and, consequently, its price. Analyzing the $117,000 Milestone for Bitcoin Price Reaching $117,000 is not just another number on the chart; it represents a psychological and technical milestone for the Bitcoin price . This level, while not an all-time high, signifies strong buying pressure and a break past previous resistance points, which often turn into new support levels. Historically, such breakouts tend to attract more buyers, creating a positive feedback loop. Market monitoring by various sources, including what Bitcoin World has observed, indicates that BTC’s trading volume has surged alongside its price, particularly on major exchanges like the Binance USDT market. High trading volumes during a price ascent suggest strong conviction among buyers, rather than a fleeting speculative pump. This sustained interest points to a healthier rally. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the market dynamics: Factor Impact on Bitcoin Price Current Observation Supply Dynamics (Halving) Reduces new supply, increases scarcity value. Anticipation building for next halving cycle. Demand Drivers (ETFs, Institutions) Increases mainstream adoption and investment. Significant institutional capital flowing in. Market Sentiment Positive news fuels investor confidence. Overwhelmingly bullish sentiment post-$117,000. Global Macroeconomics Inflation concerns drive demand for hard assets. Bitcoin seen as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Is This Bitcoin Price Rally Sustainable? Navigating Volatility While the current momentum is strong, the sustainability of any rally, including this impressive Bitcoin price surge, is always a key question for investors. Bitcoin is known for its volatility, and sharp corrections can follow rapid gains. However, several factors suggest that this rally might have more fundamental underpinnings than previous speculative bubbles. Benefits of the Current Environment: Broader Participation: The market is no longer dominated by retail investors. Institutional involvement brings more stability and long-term investment horizons. Increased Utility: Bitcoin’s use cases are expanding beyond just a store of value, with growing acceptance for payments and as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi). Regulatory Clarity: While still evolving, regulatory frameworks in many countries are becoming clearer, reducing uncertainty for large-scale investors. Potential Challenges and Risks: Profit-Taking: After significant gains, some investors may choose to take profits, leading to temporary pullbacks.

The ASX-listed crypto fund manager has expanded its Bitcoin treasury by a whopping 74.7 BTC, marking a significant addition to its already existing holdings. DigitalX Buys 74.7 BTC In a recent X social media post on July 23, DigitalX confirmed the addition of 74.7 BTC to its treasury. The acquisition, completed at an average price of $117,293 per BTC, reflects the company’s ongoing commitment to its Bitcoin-led strategy. This latest purchase has raised the crypto fund manager’s total Bitcoin holdings to 499.8 BTC, valued at approximately $91.3 million. Related Reading: Elon Musk’s SpaceX Moves Bitcoin Holdings For The First Time In 3 Years, Here’s Where It Went Notably, the company also announced and expanded on the details of this large-scale Bitcoin purchase in an official statement on Investorhub. Of its total 499.8 BTC holdings, 306.8 BTC are held directly by DigitalX, while the remaining 193 coins are held indirectly through 881,000 units in its ASX-listed Bitcoin ETF, BTXX. The recent addition of 74.7 Bitcoin follows an earlier acquisition of 57.5 BTC disclosed by the company on July 18, 2025. These back-to-back purchases demonstrate a continued reallocation of DigitalX’s digital asset treasury toward Bitcoin. The firm’s total treasury, excluding cash, now exceeds $104.4 million. As part of its long-term crypto strategy, DigitalX’s targeted portfolio adjustment reinforces its role as a leading institutional-grade Bitcoin investment vehicle on the Australian Securities Exchange. The crypto fund manager highlights its latest acquisition as a key step in its ongoing effort to establish Bitcoin as its core treasury reserve asset. Shareholder Focus Sharpens As Bitcoin Treasury Value Rises According to its official statement, DigitalX’s strategy goes beyond simply growing its BTC reserve. It also aims to enhance shareholder value through consistent and transparent reporting. The crypto fund manager now tracks its Bitcoin holdings per share in Satoshis (Sats), the smallest unit of BTC. Related Reading: Hold On For Dear Life: This Bullish Bitcoin Metric Just Touched A 15-Year High As of the latest update, DigitalX’s BTC per share stands at 33.88 Sats, marking a 58% increase in its Bitcoin treasury value since June 30, 2025. This figure reflects the impact of recent acquisitions and provides a somewhat measurable benchmark for investors assessing exposure to the company’s considerable portfolio. By prioritizing Bitcoin accumulation and optimizing its treasury structure, DigitalX continues to position itself as a prominent crypto-centric firm—one that views shareholder value as directly tied to the strength and growth of its BTC holdings. The company is also doubling down on its long-term vision of leveraging the flagship cryptocurrency as a strategic financial foundation. Leigh Travers, former CEO and present Non-Executive Chairman of DigitalX, reaffirmed the company’s commitment to its digital asset goals, stating that it aims to steadily grow its BTC portfolio throughout the year and well into the future.

Bitcoin has retraced back towards the $115,000 pivot zone mentioned in our past analysis, and despite being just above 5% from its $123,200, sentiment is still mostly positive. ETH is consolidating close to its $3,860 highs, currently also above 5.70% from its recent top, but the lack of strong selling momentum within the correction shows that bulls are not ready to give up their hand yet. XRP has gone through a rough 17% correction after marking new all-time highs at $3.66. By Elior Manier Cryptocurrencies are coming off a spectacular run, and despite taking time, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) did grab some of the market share that Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) had amassed. The most popular cryptocurrencies had taken a Lance Armstrong, all-by-himself run throughout the beginning of 2025. Consistent ETF inflows, leading to strong institutional demand, created a stream of support to push up prices for BTC. Then, progressively, the same thing spread to ETH, which had been lagging considerably - touching lows at $1,363 in April for those who were not watching. There are some ongoing signs of profit taking, however, with the Whales (between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC) securing some profits at the all-time highs. Some funds and exchanges are doing the same, but not in a panic fashion. Profit taking is standard in such a market, particularly with cryptos, notably altcoins, attaining unseen highs in this cycle. For those who did not know, July 30 will mark the six months of the 180-day executive order to make a report on currencies from the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets. This is generally good news for the adoption of crypto but impairs its independence. The blockchain will, anyway, keep its integrity.

The high level of optimism is interpreted as evidence of Ether crowd FOMO, fear of missing out, which can often precede price corrections for the associated asset. On the flipside, Bitcoin and XRP showed more muted sentiment readings of 1.33 to 1 and a 1.11 to 1 bullish-to-bearish ratio, respectively. Santiment analysts note that such conditions often create entry points, as markets tend to move against the majority’s expectations. Ethereum is more vulnerable to reversal, while BTC and XRP’s lower enthusiasm levels could create room for an upside price acceleration. Bitcoin nears all-time highs, could see gains Despite having a relatively neutral sentiment, Bitcoin has kept its strides near the all-time high $123,000 level. Over the past week, it has traded within a tight band between $123,120 and $123,471, after days of aggressive gains earlier in the month. The largest coin by market cap now points to a possible transitional phase for the market, closing Friday’s trading session. Funding rates across major derivatives exchanges, including Binance, OKX, Bybit, Deribit, BitMEX, and HTX, have been neutral to slightly positive. The absence of extreme long positioning or excessive leverage could mean traders are in a ”wait and see” stance, hoping for a clear price direction. According to CryptoQuant contributor Nino, the market behavior is a seasonal lull in activity often referred to as the “summer doldrums,” which can precede heightened volatility later in Q3 2025. Exchange inflows show institutional activity up during price peaks Over the period between July 22 and July 25, Bitcoin’s price ranged from $115,000 to $119,500, peaking on July 24 at 16:00 before dropping to around $115,000 by the morning of July 25.

Source: CryptoQuant Similarly, wallets in the 100 to 1,000 BTC and 1,000 to 10,000 BTC bands had high numbers of inflows at the same time, suggesting that large stakeholders may have contributed to the price movement through profit-taking or repositioning. Smaller transactions, those between 0.01 and 1 BTC, were steady throughout the period, but inflows from addresses holding over 10,000 BTC remained minimal, although a slight uptick was registered during the July 24 peak. XRP low social interest could spark short-term rally Meanwhile, XRP has a subdued social media sentiment, as it ranks lowest among the three assets tracked by Santiment.

2025-07-25 21:45:15+00:00,Christie’s Real Estate Opens New Division for Crypto Investors,"Christie’s International Real Estate, a well-established brokerage, has launched a new division specializing in the sale of crypto real estate . This unit is designed to help buyers and sellers complete property deals using cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin (BTC), instead of traditional currency. This move puts Christie’s ahead in the housing market as crypto becomes more critical in global finance. A Dedicated Team for Crypto Real Estate Transactions Christie’s International Real Estate is now the first major U.S. luxury brokerage to establish a dedicated team for crypto transactions. The team includes lawyers, financial analysts, and crypto specialists. This new division is led by Aaron Kirman, the chief executive of the Christie’s group based in Los Angeles. Kirman decided to launch the division after several luxury homes were successfully sold using virtual assets. He stated that the transaction was completed smoothly, reinforcing his view that digital currency will play an increasingly significant role in property sales. The new team will assist with legal paperwork, digital payment processing, and the protection of client identities. This will enable high-value transactions to be completed securely without relying on traditional banks. Kirman is now in talks with several major banks to allow homes to be financed to accept cryptocurrency. He believes that within five years, more than one-third of all home purchases in the U.S. will involve some form of digital currency. Crypto’s Growing Role in U.S. Policy The decision by Christie’s comes at a time when the U.S. government is showing strong support for digital currency. President Trump recently signed the Genius Act , which introduces clear rules for stablecoins. The House of Representatives has also passed the Clarity Act, which aims to protect the crypto industry from strict regulations. This bill is currently awaiting review by the Senate. These policy changes follow a series of executive actions promoting digital finance. President Trump, whose personal holdings in cryptocurrency are estimated to be $7.1 billion, has publicly supported the broader use of digital assets. His family’s crypto-focused company, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), which is set to begin trading soon , has also experienced significant growth. Crypto Mainstream Adoption Accelerates With increasing federal support, cryptocurrency is becoming an integral part of the housing market. In June, the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said it is considering crypto holdings when evaluating mortgage applications. Industry leaders, such as Cathie Wood, have publicly endorsed this proposal , stating that it will give cryptocurrency a larger role in the U.S. financial system. Although crypto-based real estate transactions are still uncommon, interest is rising, especially among wealthy individuals. Additionally, major real estate companies, such as Cardone Capital, are entering the world of digital assets . In June, the company acquired 1,000 BTC, worth over $101 million. It became the first real estate investment firm to fully integrate a Bitcoin strategy into its treasury.

Additionally, major real estate companies, such as Cardone Capital, are entering the world of digital assets . In June, the company acquired 1,000 BTC, worth over $101 million.

The comments came on July 19, shortly after Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan had decided to start charging fintech companies for access to their users’ banking data. Tyler said this new policy would financially destroy fintechs that help people link their bank accounts to platforms like Gemini. Tyler took his frustration to X, tagging Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, in his post. “Sorry Jamie Dimon, we’re not going to stay silent,” Tyler wrote . “We will continue to call out this anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior and immoral attempt to bankrupt fintech and crypto companies. We will never stop fighting for what is right!” The complaint wasn’t just about the fees. Tyler claimed JPMorgan’s response to his post was to pause Gemini’s onboarding process entirely. That decision, he said, was an intentional act of retaliation. And it’s not the first time this has happened. JPMorgan dropped Gemini before Trump backed crypto Years before Trump’s crypto-friendly approach took hold, JPMorgan had already told Gemini to find another bank. The firm considered Gemini unprofitable at the time and dumped it. Tyler pointed out that this long-standing friction has now resurfaced, and it’s happening again under different circumstances, this time, right after he criticized them publicly. Tyler and his twin brother, Cameron Winklevoss, both supported Donald Trump’s last campaign. In 2025, they have also been present at multiple White House events during Trump’s current term. This renewed access to Washington comes as his administration supports policies that reduce regulatory pressure on crypto companies. While Tyler’s comments were blunt, they’re not totally unexpected. Jamie Dimon has built a reputation for trashing crypto over the years. In the past, he called bitcoin a “fraud” and even told the press that if any JPMorgan trader bought bitcoin, they’d be fired. He also labeled the asset class as useful only to criminals. But in a surprising turn, JPMorgan is now looking to enter crypto lending. JPMorgan quietly prepares crypto lending plans Even as Tyler blasts the bank for hurting crypto firms, JPMorgan is reportedly preparing to offer crypto-backed loans. The bank is planning to begin lending directly against bitcoin and ether, possibly as early as next year. The plan could include using crypto as collateral, something most traditional banks, including Goldman Sachs, still don’t do. The bank already lends against crypto ETFs, and this would be the next step. Although no formal announcement has been made, Dimon’s public tone has shifted. Speaking in May, he said, “I don’t think you should smoke, but I defend your right to smoke. I defend your right to buy bitcoin. Go at it.” That was a dramatic change from his older stance. The internal pivot at JPMorgan may be due to alienation from wealthy clients who built their portfolios through crypto. Tyler believes their current approach, charging fintechs for access to banking data, shows the bank still doesn’t want crypto firms in its space, especially those that dare criticize its policies. Gemini isn’t standing still. Earlier this year, it confidentially filed for an initial public offering, according to Bloomberg, which says the firm could list before year-end, depending on how quickly the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission wraps up its ongoing investigation. In January, Gemini settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, agreeing to pay $5 million. Gemini was founded in 2015 by Tyler and Cameron after their legal fight with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg over the origin of the social network. Since then, they’ve built Gemini into one of the most well-known crypto exchanges in the U.S., despite frequent regulatory battles and banking challenges. Tyler’s accusations come at a moment when political sentiment in Washington has actually changed for the first time ever. After years of uncertainty under Biden, crypto firms are gaining momentum. The U.S. House of Representatives just passed the first major crypto law to regulate stablecoins. Trump signed the bill into law the very next day. That change could open the door for more crypto-focused financial products, even from banks like JPMorgan. But as far as Tyler is concerned, the fight is now about banks silencing their critics.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Coinbase Assets says it is adding support for Jito Staked SOL ( JITOSOL ) and non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Metaplex ( MPLX ). “Jito Staked SOL and Metaplex are now live on http://coinbase.com and in the Coinbase iOS and Android apps. Coinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive or store these assets.” News of the support caused both assets to dip as JITOSOL is trading for $217 at time of writing, a 6.8% decrease on the day while MPLX is valued at $0.169, a fractional decrease during the last 24 hours. JITOSOL is a liquid staked token (LST) where users can earn extra rewards by staking Solana on the decentralized finance (DeFi) network Jito. Furthermore, according to its official website , the asset not only stays in your crypto wallet and accrues two forms of interest, but it is also liquid, meaning it isn’t locked up and can be traded on demand. “JitoSOL is a reward-bearing LST that maintains a constant quantity in your wallet. What sets JitoSOL apart is its dual reward system, accruing both staking and MEV rewards. And as rewards accrue over time the JitoSOL/SOL exchange rate increases as well.” MPLX is the native asset of the Metaplex NFT marketplace, a decentralized platform built on top of Solana that serves as its governance token as well as provides the infrastructure for minting, trading, and managing NFTs.

During a Thursday interview with CNBC, the executive revealed that market conditions increasingly favor ETH’s upside. Corporate Interest and ETF Flows “I think Ethereum probably has a lot of chance to outperform Bitcoin in the next three to six months,” said Novogratz. He explained that big companies buying the asset was helping propel its rise.”The narrative of ETH is really powerful,” he added. Several publicly listed firms are now choosing to hold ETH in their treasuries, following the example set by Strategy, which opted for BTC as a reserve asset. These include SharpLink Gaming, which holds over 360,000 ETH; BitMine, which has more than 566,000 ETH and a goal to control 5% of the total supply; and Bit Digital, a mining firm with over 120,000 ETH on its books. Novogratz said that the cryptocurrency’s price has “caught up a lot,” predicting that it will also hit the $4,000 ceiling several times in the future. CoinGecko data shows that ETH is trading around $3,659, up a slight 1.5% in the last seven days, after hitting a 2025 high of $3,848 at the beginning of the week, before retracing. According to the financier, if it crosses the $4,000 mark, it could trigger a strong price discovery. Beyond corporate adoption, ETH exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S are experiencing a dramatic influx of investor interest. On July 16, these products posted a record $726 million in net inflows, followed by another $533 million on July 22, bringing weekly additions to over $2.1 billion. This surge has driven total AUM past $20 billion, with major players like BlackRock and Fidelity capturing the bulk of demand. Could BTC Hit $150K? The crypto entrepreneur also spoke about BTC during his appearance on Squawk Box, saying that it could get to the $150,000 mark this year. At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency was changing hands for $115,324, down 4.2% over the past week but up nearly 9% in the last month. BTC also recently achieved a new all-time high, flying past the $123,000 mark. According to Novogratz, the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates will influence this momentum. He believes any policy shift away from lower rates could challenge BTC’s trajectory. He points to rising capital expenditures, upcoming tariffs, and China’s reflation efforts as driving forces behind current interest. With the Trump administration expected to push for lower rates by 2026, Novogratz believes these conditions will continue to support demand for assets like BTC and ETH. Despite the potential for shifts in monetary policy, he remains bullish on both.

2025-07-25 22:36:15+00:00,Surging Capital Inflows Into Digital Assets: U.S. Regulatory Clarity Fuels $60B Crypto Boom,"The inflow of capital into digital assets has totaled $60 billion since the beginning of the year, according to a report from JPMorgan analysts. This figure has grown by almost 50% since the end of May and could exceed last year’s record. The primary sources of capital inflow are crypto funds, the CME futures market, and venture investments. The main catalyst is an improved regulatory environment in the U.S. Analysts say the GENIUS Act has brought clarity to stablecoin regulation and set a benchmark for other countries. Another document, the CLARITY Act, could make the United States more attractive to crypto companies compared to the EU and its MiCA regulation, according to analysts. Improved legislation is stimulating activity in the markets. Venture capital funding has increased, and public companies are showing new momentum. Analysts have noted the successful IPO of Circle, as well as growth in new applications filed with the SEC. Demand for Ethereum Investors are also showing increased interest in altcoins. Ethereum has been the main beneficiary, thanks to its dominance in DeFi and its growing use in corporate reserves alongside Bitcoin. Asset managers are interested in launching altcoin ETFs with staking functionality. In particular, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) exchange-traded fund from BlackRock attracted $10 billion in a year, according to Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas. He noted that this instrument became the third in history in terms of how quickly it reached this milestone. The first two are Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity. Balchunas also observed that assets in the fund grew from $5 billion to $10 billion in just ten days. The fund entered the top five in terms of inflows over the past week and month.

The inflow of capital into digital assets has totaled $60 billion since the beginning of the year, according to a report from JPMorgan analysts. This figure has grown by almost 50% since the end of May and could exceed last year’s record. The primary sources of capital inflow are crypto funds, the CME futures market, and venture investments. The main catalyst is an improved regulatory environment in the U.S. Analysts say the GENIUS Act has brought clarity to stablecoin regulation and set a benchmark for other countries. Another document, the CLARITY Act, could make the United States more attractive to crypto companies compared to the EU and its MiCA regulation, according to analysts. Improved legislation is stimulating activity in the markets. Venture capital funding has increased, and public companies are showing new momentum. Analysts have noted the successful IPO of Circle, as well as growth in new applications filed with the SEC. Demand for Ethereum Investors are also showing increased interest in altcoins. Ethereum has been the main beneficiary, thanks to its dominance in DeFi and its growing use in corporate reserves alongside Bitcoin. Asset managers are interested in launching altcoin ETFs with staking functionality. In particular, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) exchange-traded fund from BlackRock attracted $10 billion in a year, according to Bloomberg senior analyst Eric Balchunas. He noted that this instrument became the third in history in terms of how quickly it reached this milestone. The first two are Bitcoin ETFs from BlackRock and Fidelity. Balchunas also observed that assets in the fund grew from $5 billion to $10 billion in just ten days. The fund entered the top five in terms of inflows over the past week and month.
