According to a recent announcement, the company is all set to raise $850 million to expand its Bitcoin holdings and support other initiatives. MARA Holdings plans to raise $850 million through a private offering of zero-interest convertible notes due in 2032. These notes can later be converted into cash, MARA stock, or a mix of both. An extra $150 million may also be offered depending on demand. Out of the funds raised, $50 million could go toward buying back some of MARA’s older debt (1% notes due 2026). The rest will be used for buying more Bitcoin, general business needs, and possibly paying down other debts or funding strategic growth. Already holding over 50,000 BTC, MARA is doubling down on its crypto bet. MARA is the second-largest public company holding Bitcoin, just behind Microstrategy, which holds over 600,000 BTC. Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high of $123,000, but has slipped back to around $116K. However, large institutions are not backing off and continue to invest heavily, showing strong confidence in its long-term potential.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/mara-holdings-to-raise-850m-as-it-doubles-down-on-bitcoin/,BTC|BUSINESS,News|Bitcoin,BTC,"MARA Holdings To Raise $850M As It Doubles Down On Bitcoin.

Last week, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to the US dollar, requiring each token to be fully backed by liquid assets such as cash or short-term US Treasuries. In a new Bloomberg interview, Faulkender explains in detail how the passage of the stablecoin bill into law would translate to massive demand for US debt. “We now have a digital asset that has rules of the road established by Congress for what backs those digital assets. It provides enormous amounts of confidence to not only Americans, but our trading partners around the world, who are then willing to make exchanges, to invoice dollars and then be paid via stablecoins because they know that it is an asset that has a value behind it. Because what is it that backs it? Primarily, it’s going to be T-bills.” Faulkender notes that while wiring money abroad typically takes a day or two to settle, stablecoins can deliver funds in just seconds. “And so it’s going to enormously hasten the timeframe for making payments. It’s more secure, it’s more private, it’s significantly cheaper. And so if indeed this does revolutionize the way that international payments are invoiced and paid, then there should be a flocking to this technology. And if all of that trade therefore is even further denominated in stablecoins, then there’s going to be demand for the underlying asset, which are Treasury securities.

2025-07-23 14:45:20+00:00,Bitcoin Acquisition: H100 Group’s Bold Move to Boost Holdings to 628 BTC,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: H100 Group’s Bold Move to Boost Holdings to 628 BTC In a world increasingly embracing digital assets, a significant trend is emerging: established companies are diversifying their treasury reserves with Bitcoin. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it’s a strategic realignment. The latest to make headlines is Swedish health-tech firm H100 Group, which has just announced a substantial Bitcoin acquisition , further solidifying its commitment to the leading cryptocurrency. This move signals a growing conviction among diverse industries about Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in modern corporate finance. H100 Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Journey H100 Group, a name typically associated with healthcare innovation, has once again demonstrated its forward-thinking approach, this time in the realm of digital finance. The company recently announced on X (formerly Twitter) that it has acquired an additional 117.93 BTC. This latest purchase significantly increases their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 628.22 BTC. This isn’t a one-off event; it’s a continuation of a well-thought-out strategy. The company had previously secured $1.5 million specifically to fund its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, indicating a deliberate and planned approach to integrating digital assets into its financial framework. This proactive stance by a health-tech firm underscores a broader shift in corporate treasury management, where companies are looking beyond traditional assets to hedge against inflation and secure long-term value. The decision to accumulate Bitcoin reflects a sophisticated understanding of the current economic landscape. With global inflation concerns and the devaluation of fiat currencies, Bitcoin offers a decentralized, finite supply asset that can serve as a robust store of value. For H100 Group, this isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic allocation designed to protect and potentially grow shareholder value in an evolving financial ecosystem. Their consistent accumulation demonstrates confidence in Bitcoin’s future trajectory and its role as ‘digital gold’ in the 21st century. Why are Companies Embracing Bitcoin Acquisition? H100 Group’s move is part of a larger, compelling narrative. Companies worldwide, from tech giants to traditional enterprises, are increasingly exploring or actively pursuing Bitcoin acquisition . But what exactly is driving this trend? Several key factors contribute to Bitcoin’s appeal as a corporate treasury asset: Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against the erosion of purchasing power. Unlike fiat currencies, it cannot be devalued by central banks printing more money. Store of Value: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares many characteristics with traditional precious metals, including scarcity, durability, and divisibility. It provides a reliable means to preserve capital over the long term. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury portfolio offers diversification away from traditional assets like cash, bonds, and equities, which may be subject to different market dynamics and risks. Technological Innovation & Future-Proofing: Embracing Bitcoin aligns companies with cutting-edge financial technology and demonstrates a forward-thinking approach. It positions them to capitalize on the growing digital economy. Increased Institutional Acceptance: With growing regulatory clarity and the entry of major financial institutions into the crypto space, Bitcoin is gaining mainstream acceptance, reducing perceived risks for corporate adoption. Pioneering companies like MicroStrategy, which began its substantial Bitcoin accumulation in 2020, have set a precedent, demonstrating the viability and potential benefits of holding significant Bitcoin reserves. Their success has encouraged others to follow suit, leading to a noticeable shift in corporate treasury strategies. The Health-Tech Perspective: H100 Group’s Vision It might seem unconventional for a health-tech firm to be so deeply invested in Bitcoin, but H100 Group’s actions highlight a broader principle: innovation isn’t confined to a single industry. Health-tech, by its very nature, is about looking forward, embracing new technologies, and finding better solutions for complex problems. This ethos extends to their financial strategy. H100 Group’s consistent Bitcoin acquisition demonstrates a belief that digital assets are not just speculative instruments but foundational elements of the future economy. Their vision likely encompasses a long-term outlook where Bitcoin serves as a robust pillar of their balance sheet, protecting against economic uncertainties and potentially providing significant upside. This strategic foresight positions H100 Group not just as a leader in health technology but also as an innovator in corporate finance, willing to challenge ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/h100-bitcoin-acquisition-boost/,BTC|REGULATION|TREASURY|MARKET|FIAT,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Corporate Treasury|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Digital Assets|H100 Group,BTC,"Bitcoin Acquisition: H100 Group’s Bold Move to Boost Holdings to 628 BTC.

Their vision likely encompasses a long-term outlook where Bitcoin serves as a robust pillar of their balance sheet, protecting against economic uncertainties and potentially providing significant upside. This strategic foresight positions H100 Group not just as a leader in health technology but also as an innovator in corporate finance, willing to challenge"

On May 30, the company put CEO Rahul Mewawalla on notice for “ Cause ” under his contract. Days later, he was placed on administrative leave. Then, on July 8, his board seat was taken away and a lawsuit was filed in Delaware’s Court of Chancery. The suit accuses him of fraud and breach of duty while at the helm of the Nasdaq‑listed Bitcoin miner. Key Rewards Then Sudden Fallout According to reports, just months before his ouster, Mewawalla received $2.5 million in cash bonuses and 1.2 million restricted stock units. His base pay was also raised to $1.2 million. Back then, Mawson praised his leadership, citing 36% revenue growth, a 35% jump in gross profit and cuts in SG&A expenses during his tenure. Now, those same achievements stand alongside allegations that he misused his role and harmed shareholders. #Bitcoin Miner Mawson Fires CEO, Files Fraud Lawsuit – What’s Going On?

Saloom faces the task of steering the firm through what could be a long legal battle. Based on reports, the board is seeking to recover damages that it says stem from Mewawalla’s actions. At the same time, he has pushed back. In a July 17 letter, he “respectfully and vigorously” denied any wrongdoing and pointed to the board’s earlier public praise of his results. Ongoing Miner Dispute Adds Pressure This fight comes as Mawson is already tangled in another suit. Stone Ridge, which owns NYDIG, accused Mawson of wrongfully taking control of over 20,000 ASIC miners valued at about $30 million. The two sides had a colocation deal starting December 2023, set to end by March 2025. But disagreements over fees turned ugly. Mawson sent invoices totaling $1.9 million for space and power. Stone Ridge said there was a deal to cut energy use in the final month and disputed those bills. Mawson then changed the payout address for the miners and barred access to Stone Ridge staff, citing a contract clause that the other side says doesn’t apply.

2025-07-23 15:05:47+00:00,US authorities track $7.1M in crypto after dismantling international $97M oil investment scam,"Seattle-based federal prosecutors have sought the forfeiture of $7.1 million in custodial cryptocurrency value associated with an oil and gas scam between June 2022 and July 2024. The U.S. Attorney’s Office alleged that the larger scheme brought in $97 million from investors by promoting a fake business model involving oil tank storage rentals. In December 2024, Homeland Security seized the $7.1 million. The prosecutors are now looking to distribute the money to legitimate victims. “Federal investigators and prosecutors in our office moved as quickly as possible to trace and seize the cryptocurrency so that some of the losses can be returned to victims.” ~ U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller The scam was allegedly international, with the criminals located in Russia and Nigeria turning victims’ cash into crypto and funneling it through domestic exchanges. Acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller said that the fraudulent parties created several crypto accounts to mask the transfer of funds, a classic laundering strategy to avoid detection. Key suspect used Binance for crypto transfers One person, at least, is said to have assisted money laundering activities by transnational crime groups. Geoffrey Auyeung was indicted and charged in August 2024 with core participation in laundering stolen funds. Court records show that he used the stolen funds to purchase Bitcoin, Ether, USDT, USDC, and moved most of the sums to Binance. At the time of his arrest, $2.3 million was confiscated in his US accounts. According to the Department of Justice, Auyeung and co-conspirators appealed to be authentic investment managers who would provide huge profits in oil tank leasing activities. Upon raising funds, they shut down communication with investors. So far, prosecutors have uncovered more than $17.9 million in direct losses, although more victims are anticipated to emerge as the investigation process proceeds. DOJ ramps up crypto fraud enforcement The Seattle case is part of a broader crackdown by U.S. authorities targeting crypto-related financial crimes . Recent court filings revealed the DOJ seized $2 million in USDT and Binance-based assets linked to Hamas. Investigators traced the funds through a Gaza-based money transfer business known as BuyCash, which allegedly helped finance the group’s activities. Other fraud cases are also coming into the limelight. Shane Donovan Moore, a former rugby player, was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison after operating a Ponzi scheme using a crypto mining company as a bogus front. Between 2021 and 2022, Moore defrauded more than 40 investors of almost $900,000 through his firm Quantum Donovan LLC. In another case, a Denver-based pastor and his wife face 40 criminal charges regarding a crypto-based investment scheme based on faith that robbed people of over $3 million. The indictment cites the ongoing abuse of trust-based networks in seeking crypto funds. According to FBI data, digital asset fraud is on the rise.

Bitwise Responds and Explains Its Expectations!,"The recent rise in Ethereum (ETH) has attracted all the attention and led the way for altcoins. While the reasons for the rise in Ethereum continue to be discussed, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan said that Ethereum''s recent rise is mainly due to the sharp increase in institutional demand. According to The Block, Bitwise CIO stated that there was a demand shock in ETH. Hougan said that since May 15, institutions have purchased approximately 2.83 million ETH with an estimated value of $10 billion, which is approximately 32 times more than what the network generated during that period. Stating that he expects this institutional demand and upward trend in Ethereum to continue, the Bitwise CIO estimated that ETFs and institutional treasuries could purchase 5.33 million ETH worth approximately $20 billion next year. Hougan also likened the current situation in Ethereum to Bitcoin''s rally in 2024. The famous CIO pointed out that the surge in demand experienced after the approval of spot BTC ETFs in January 2024 was also experienced in ETH. At this point, Hougan said that the demand increase in Ethereum started late compared to Bitcoin, and that spot ETH ETFs have bought more than $5 billion worth of Ethereum since mid-May. “Apart from ETFs, companies like BitMine Immersion, SharpLink Gaming, Bit Digital, and the soon-to-be-IPO The Ether Machine have announced significant treasury strategies. These entities purchased a total of 2.83 million ETH, likely extending the current rally above $3.80.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Will Ethereum''s Strong Rally Continue?

2025-07-23 15:24:49+00:00,Altcoins Soar as Bitcoin Rests – But Froth Builds in Crypto Markets,"Altcoins are showing broad strength following Bitcoin’s explosive July rally. Surging open interest across the sector, however, suggests speculative froth may be building. Such a build-up may raise the risk of sharper volatility ahead. Traders Bet Big on Altcoins Bitcoin rallied from $105.4K to a new ATH of $122.7K this month, which pushed its realized cap above $1 trillion for the first time. However, Bitcoin’s near-term momentum has since cooled, and its price has coiled just below ATH levels. Alts, on the other hand, have begun to outperform in a classic capital rotation along the risk curve. Glassnode reported that altseason conditions first emerged on July 7 and have remained intact. Ethereum is leading the charge, and the altcoin market cap has increased by $216 billion over the past two weeks. This figure is one of the largest USD-denominated surges on record. The broad-based rally appears to be occurring largely unanchored from asset-specific fundamentals, with nearly all altcoin sectors now moving in close lockstep. Correlations with Bitcoin have decreased significantly, which confirms a growing divergence in price behavior between Bitcoin and the broader alts ecosystem. However, this growing optimism and aggressive positioning have translated into a sharp rise in futures leverage across top altcoins. Glassnode found that the combined open interest for Ethereum, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin soared from $26 billion to $44 billion in July alone. This increase in leveraged positions, which is consistently above the +2 standard deviation threshold for 12 consecutive days, is the longest stretch on record. It indicates a potential speculative froth building across the altcoin sector, which could leave markets more susceptible to sharp volatility. Elevated leverage amplifies both upside and downside moves, and makes the environment “reflexive and fragile.” Glassnode also noted that the cumulative monthly funding premium paid by long-side futures across top altcoins has climbed to $32.9 million per month. This is nearing levels last seen during Bitcoin’s March 2024 peak, though it remains below the peak euphoria witnessed during the initial $100K breakout in late 2024. The elevated cost of leverage indicates that traders are aggressively seeking long exposure. Capital Flows to Ethereum Ethereum’s open interest dominance has now risen to 38%, while Bitcoin’s stands at 62%. Such a difference reflects a notable rotation of capital and speculative activity toward Ethereum at the margins. In fact, Ethereum’s open interest dominance has reached its highest level since April 2023, with only 5% of trading days recording a higher value. Meanwhile, Ethereum perpetual volume dominance has overtaken Bitcoin’s for the first time since the 2022 cycle low, the largest volume skew in ETH’s favor on record. This significant rotation towards altcoins, while indicative of renewed optimism and capital inflows into the broader crypto market, also raises caution. If Bitcoin’s consolidation continues or weakness emerges, it could pose headwinds to altcoin momentum. This, in turn, could risk a swift unwinding of leverage-heavy positions. As such, while altcoins are currently displaying broad strength, the rapid acceleration in open interest and leverage-fueled positioning points to a “frothy” backdrop that could increase volatility.

This isn’t just another corporate milestone; it’s a profound statement about the evolving financial landscape and the undeniable rise of digital assets. For anyone tracking the pulse of finance, especially those invested in the future of decentralized systems, Block’s S&P500 entry is a landmark event. Let’s delve into why this inclusion is so significant, especially considering Block’s substantial holdings of 8,584 Bitcoin (BTC). What Does Block’s S&P500 Inclusion Truly Mean? The S&P500 is more than just an index; it’s a benchmark of American economic prowess, representing 500 of the largest and most liquid U.S. companies. Inclusion in this elite group signifies a company’s robust financial health, market leadership, and consistent growth. For Block, a company that has championed digital payments and embraced cryptocurrency, its entry sends a clear signal: Mainstream Validation: Block’s presence in the S&P500 lends unprecedented legitimacy to a company deeply intertwined with the crypto ecosystem. It suggests that traditional finance is increasingly recognizing the stability and long-term potential of businesses operating in this space. Increased Visibility and Investment: As an S&P500 component, Block will automatically be included in countless index funds and ETFs, leading to passive investment inflows. This broadens its investor base beyond tech-focused or crypto-specific funds. Enhanced Credibility: The rigorous criteria for S&P500 inclusion – including market capitalization, profitability, and liquidity – underscore Block’s operational excellence and financial stability. This can bolster investor confidence and attract new capital. To understand the gravity of this achievement, consider the typical requirements for S&P500 inclusion: Criterion Description Block’s Achievement Market Capitalization Must exceed a specific threshold (currently around $14.5 billion USD). Block comfortably exceeds this, demonstrating significant market value. Profitability Sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ GAAP earnings must be positive. Consistent profitability across its diverse business segments. Liquidity High trading volume to ensure efficient market operations. Actively traded on the NYSE, ensuring high liquidity. U.S. Company Must be a U.S. company listed on a major U.S. exchange. Headquartered in the U.S. and listed on the NYSE. Block’s Bitcoin Bet: A Bold Strategy That Paid Off? One of the most fascinating aspects of Block’s journey is its steadfast commitment to Bitcoin. With 8,584 BTC on its balance sheet, Block stands out as a publicly traded company with significant direct exposure to the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This isn’t merely an investment; it’s a strategic alignment with Jack Dorsey’s vision for a decentralized financial future. Dorsey, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, believes BTC will be the native currency of the internet. Block’s decision to hold Bitcoin reflects this conviction, viewing it as a long-term investment and a key component of its future offerings. This move has been both praised for its foresight and questioned for its volatility exposure. However, with the rising institutional interest in Bitcoin, Block’s early and significant bet appears increasingly validated. Beyond its balance sheet holdings, Block facilitates Bitcoin adoption through its popular Cash App , allowing millions of users to buy, sell, and send BTC. This integration not only generates revenue but also positions Block as a pivotal player in mainstream crypto adoption. How Does This Impact the Broader Crypto Landscape? The inclusion of a company like Block in the S&P500 has far-reaching implications for the entire cryptocurrency industry. It serves as a powerful testament to crypto’s growing legitimacy and integration into the global financial system. Catalyst for Institutional Adoption: When a major index like the S&P500 includes a crypto-friendly company, it subtly encourages other traditional institutions to re-evaluate their stance on digital assets. It normalizes the idea of companies holding or facilitating crypto. Validation for Bitcoin: Block’s substantial Bitcoin holdings, now part of an S&P500 company’s assets, provide a layer of indirect validation for BTC itself. It demonstrates that a reputable, large-cap company sees strategic value in the digital asset.

2025-07-23 15:59:19+00:00,World’s Largest Bitcoin Miner MARA Raises $850M to Expand 50K BTC Treasury,"MARA Holdings, the world’s largest Bitcoin mining company, announced plans to raise $850 million through zero-coupon convertible senior notes due 2032 to expand its existing treasury of 44,893 BTC . According to its official press release , the Miami-based digital energy company expects to grant initial purchasers an additional $150 million option, potentially bringing the total offering to $1 billion. MARA will allocate up to $50 million of net proceeds to repurchase existing 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2026, while dedicating the remainder to Bitcoin purchases, capped call transaction costs, and general corporate purposes. The convertible notes will carry no regular interest payments and mature on August 1, 2032, with holders gaining conversion rights into cash, MARA common stock, or a combination at the company’s discretion.

MARA’s Q1 2025 results revealed these industry challenges, with the company reporting a net loss of $533 million despite achieving a 30% increase in revenue to $214 million. CEO Fred Thiel has previously advocated for a hybrid approach combining mining operations with strategic Bitcoin purchases during market declines to optimize acquisition costs. “As a miner that mines and buys Bitcoin, the hybrid approach provides us significant flexibility to acquire Bitcoin at attractive prices,” Thiel stated in the company’s December 2024 report. @fgthiel , CEO of Bitcoin miner @MARAHoldings , has suggested retail investors to adopt a ""buy and hold"" Bitcoin strategy. #Bitcoin #MARA $BTC https://t.co/lpbyVi7Mp0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) January 3, 2025 The strategy positions MARA alongside other major miners as they shift their operations, with Core Scientific facing potential divestiture of crypto assets following its $9 billion acquisition by CoreWeave, while HIVE Digital explores AI data center hosting to supplement its mining revenues. MARA’s convertible note structure includes provisions that allow the company to redeem notes for cash after January 15, 2030, while holders retain repurchase rights if stock prices fall below specified conversion thresholds. The company expects to enter capped call transactions with initial purchasers to mitigate potential dilution upon note conversion, utilizing established hedging mechanisms commonly employed in corporate convertible offerings. Divergence in Digital Treasury Strategies as Corporate Adoption Accelerates MARA’s Bitcoin-focused approach contrasts sharply with emerging trends in treasury diversification among public companies entering the digital asset space. Over 273 companies now maintain Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 124 companies as of June, according to BitcoinTreasuries data. Yet, corporate strategies increasingly diverge from simple Bitcoin accumulation. NYSE-listed Sequans Communications recently purchased 1,264 Bitcoin for $150 million , bringing its total holdings to 2,317 BTC as part of a pure Bitcoin treasury strategy similar to MARA’s approach.

2025-07-23 16:00:15+00:00,Cardano Cracks Bitcoin Code: Smart Contracts Without A Single Change,"In an announcement that rekindles the perennial debate over how far Bitcoin can—or should—stretch beyond its original remit, Input Output (IO), the research and engineering company behind Cardano, has unveiled a compilation pipeline that executes Cardano smart contracts on Bitcoin without touching a line of Bitcoin’s consensus code. “A novel compilation pipeline being developed at Input | Output takes a Cardano smart contract, written using a modern language like Python, TypeScript, or Scala, and runs it on Bitcoin without modifying Bitcoin itself,” the company wrote on X late Tuesday night, attaching a six‑post technical thread that spelled out the process in detail. Bitcoin Gets Cardano Smart Contracts The thread describes a relay of representations that begins with high‑level source code and ends inside Bitcoin Script. First, Cardano’s tool‑chain lowers the contract into Untyped Plutus Core (UPLC), a stripped‑down functional bytecode. UPLC is then serialized and handed to a miniature interpreter known as the Control–Environment–Continuation (CEK) machine. Instead of asking Bitcoin to interpret UPLC directly, IO compiles the CEK machine itself into RISC‑V, “a real‑world, simple CPU instruction set.” The resulting RISC‑V program becomes the payload that Bitcoin ultimately verifies, with the serialized UPLC passed to it at run‑time. A companion blog post signed by software engineer Riley Kilgore frames the design in a single sentence: “By combining a serialized smart contract format (Untyped Plutus Core – UPLC), a clever interpreter architecture (CEK machine), and a widely supported open‑source reduced instruction set architecture (RISC‑V), IO is turning that idea into reality.” Because the RISC‑V code is deterministic and its execution trace can be proven—or disputed—inside Bitcoin Script, no soft‑fork is required. Bitcoin remains unchanged; the expressiveness is off‑loaded to an auxiliary virtual CPU whose behaviour can be challenged step by step. The security anchor for those challenges is BitVMX, a descendant of Robin Linus’s 2023 BitVM proposal for “disputable computation” on Bitcoin. IO’s newsroom statement calls BitVMX an “innovative, trust‑minimized protocol” that “operates on a 1‑out‑of‑n honest‑operator model” and lets developers “pay transaction fees in BTC directly from their preferred wallet.” BitVMX inherits the optimistic‑roll‑up style of BitVM—off‑chain execution, on‑chain fraud proofs—but replaces BitVM’s bespoke circuits with a full RISC‑V core, allowing unmodified binaries compiled by standard tool‑chains. The promise is to bring Cardano’s eUTxO‑based smart‑contract ecosystem—Marlowe, Aiken, and the rest—into Bitcoin’s vast liquidity pool. In practical terms that could mean lending, swaps, and even NFT‑backed loans secured by BTC collateral, all without giving custodial control to a sidechain. For Bitcoin purists the move is both familiar and contentious. Taproot in 2021 expanded Script with Schnorr signatures and key‑path spends, giving the network its first taste of complex smart‑contract logic, while BitVM in 2023 showed that arbitrary computation could be verified rather than executed by Bitcoin nodes. IO’s pipeline pushes those ideas further, but it does so in a way that keeps the base layer unaltered—a design criterion that BitVM’s authors called non‑negotiable for Bitcoin’s social contract. The compilation flow is still in active development; IO has not committed to a main‑net launch date, nor has it published gas‑cost benchmarks for typical contracts. What it has done is demonstrate a theoretically complete bridge between two philosophically divergent blockchains. If the engineering hurdles—transaction sizes, dispute latency, and user‑experience frictions—can be contained, Cardano’s software stack may soon become a first‑class citizen on Bitcoin.

2025-07-23 16:08:19+00:00,"Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Surges – BTC Forecast to $130K, Altcoins Like SOL and ONDO Poised to Follow","Corporate interest in Bitcoin is accelerating, fueling fresh optimism across the crypto market. As more companies adopt BTC as part of their treasury strategy or payment infrastructure, price forecasts are pushing higher—many now eyeing a move to $130,000. But Bitcoin isn’t the only asset poised to benefit from this institutional wave. Altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ondo Finance (ONDO) are also gaining traction, showing strong technical setups and renewed investor interest. In this article, we explore how this growing corporate adoption could drive the next leg up for BTC and spotlight altcoins that may follow its lead. Bitcoin Holds Strong Around $120K as Bulls Eye Breakout Source: tradingview Bitcoin continues to trade confidently between $114,000 and $121,000, showing resilience even amid a relatively quiet week, with gains under 0.5%. On a broader scale, however, BTC has posted a solid 17% increase over the past month—fueling optimism that a larger move could be imminent. The next key level to watch is the $125,000 resistance. A successful break above this threshold could propel Bitcoin toward the $131,000 zone, marking an additional 9% climb. Strong support at $112,000 is helping reinforce bullish sentiment, offering a reliable buffer against short-term volatility. With the RSI still sitting in a neutral range, there''s plenty of room for further upside without triggering overbought signals. Having already gained 14% over the last six months, Bitcoin is gaining steady traction, and many traders are watching closely for signs of an imminent breakout as institutional demand continues to build. Solana''s Surge: Potential Upswing as Investors Eye Key Resistance Source: tradingview Solana''s price currently hangs between $164 and $192. It faces resistance around $202, with support near $147. In a week, it''s up about 17%, and over the last month, it climbed nearly 46%. However, its longer six-month performance shows a 24% drop, hinting at past struggles. The coin could push to $230 if the momentum continues, marking a climb of about 44% from its lower range. With its RSI at 35, it seems relatively undervalued, suggesting room for growth. Investors are watching closely, hoping it can maintain its recent upward trend and breach the $202 resistance, targeting that $230 mark for potential gains. Ondo Coin Faces Resistance, Eyes Potential Breakout Source: tradingview Ondo (ONDO) is trading in a stable range between just under a dollar and slightly above a dollar. It''s getting close to its resistance level at about $1.22. If Ondo breaks through this, it might move to the next level of around $1.43. This would mark a potential rise of approximately 26% from its lower range. The coin''s support level near $0.79 is keeping it stable, preventing any sharp drops. Its 10-day and 100-day moving averages are closely matched, hinting at potential sideways movement. But if momentum shifts favorably, Ondo could see solid growth. Conclusion Bitcoin’s steady climb, bolstered by rising corporate adoption, is building a foundation for a potential breakout toward $130K. As confidence spreads, altcoins like Solana and Ondo are gaining momentum of their own, fueled by technical signals and favorable market sentiment.

Corporate interest in Bitcoin is accelerating, fueling fresh optimism across the crypto market. As more companies adopt BTC as part of their treasury strategy or payment infrastructure, price forecasts are pushing higher—many now eyeing a move to $130,000. But Bitcoin isn’t the only asset poised to benefit from this institutional wave. Altcoins like Solana (SOL) and Ondo Finance (ONDO) are also gaining traction, showing strong technical setups and renewed investor interest. In this article, we explore how this growing corporate adoption could drive the next leg up for BTC and spotlight altcoins that may follow its lead. Bitcoin Holds Strong Around $120K as Bulls Eye Breakout Source: tradingview Bitcoin continues to trade confidently between $114,000 and $121,000, showing resilience even amid a relatively quiet week, with gains under 0.5%. On a broader scale, however, BTC has posted a solid 17% increase over the past month—fueling optimism that a larger move could be imminent. The next key level to watch is the $125,000 resistance. A successful break above this threshold could propel Bitcoin toward the $131,000 zone, marking an additional 9% climb. Strong support at $112,000 is helping reinforce bullish sentiment, offering a reliable buffer against short-term volatility. With the RSI still sitting in a neutral range, there''s plenty of room for further upside without triggering overbought signals. Having already gained 14% over the last six months, Bitcoin is gaining steady traction, and many traders are watching closely for signs of an imminent breakout as institutional demand continues to build. Solana''s Surge: Potential Upswing as Investors Eye Key Resistance Source: tradingview Solana''s price currently hangs between $164 and $192. It faces resistance around $202, with support near $147. In a week, it''s up about 17%, and over the last month, it climbed nearly 46%. However, its longer six-month performance shows a 24% drop, hinting at past struggles. The coin could push to $230 if the momentum continues, marking a climb of about 44% from its lower range. With its RSI at 35, it seems relatively undervalued, suggesting room for growth. Investors are watching closely, hoping it can maintain its recent upward trend and breach the $202 resistance, targeting that $230 mark for potential gains. Ondo Coin Faces Resistance, Eyes Potential Breakout Source: tradingview Ondo (ONDO) is trading in a stable range between just under a dollar and slightly above a dollar. It''s getting close to its resistance level at about $1.22. If Ondo breaks through this, it might move to the next level of around $1.43. This would mark a potential rise of approximately 26% from its lower range. The coin''s support level near $0.79 is keeping it stable, preventing any sharp drops. Its 10-day and 100-day moving averages are closely matched, hinting at potential sideways movement. But if momentum shifts favorably, Ondo could see solid growth. Conclusion Bitcoin’s steady climb, bolstered by rising corporate adoption, is building a foundation for a potential breakout toward $130K. As confidence spreads, altcoins like Solana and Ondo are gaining momentum of their own, fueled by technical signals and favorable market sentiment. With resistance levels in sight and room for further upside, these assets are worth watching closely as the market braces for another potential surge. The convergence of institutional interest and altcoin resilience could define the next phase of crypto’s bull cycle. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-23 16:10:24+00:00,Ethereum Spot Volume Surges: A Pivotal Shift in Crypto Market Dynamics,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Spot Volume Surges: A Pivotal Shift in Crypto Market Dynamics The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a significant development: Ethereum spot volume has recently eclipsed Bitcoin’s, marking a pivotal moment in the digital asset landscape. For the first time since June 2024, data from CryptoQuant on X reveals that Ethereum’s spot trading volume surged to an impressive $25.7 billion last week, comfortably surpassing Bitcoin’s $24.4 billion. This shift has pushed the ETH/BTC spot volume ratio above 1, a clear indicator of increased investor rotation and a potential rebalancing of market interest. What does this mean for your crypto portfolio, and are we witnessing the early signs of a broader altcoin resurgence? What’s Driving the Ethereum Spot Volume Surge? This recent flip in trading volume isn’t just a fleeting anomaly; it reflects a confluence of factors that have been steadily building momentum for Ethereum. Understanding these drivers is key to grasping the significance of the Ethereum spot volume overtaking Bitcoin’s. Anticipation of Spot Ethereum ETFs: The most immediate catalyst is undoubtedly the growing optimism surrounding the potential approval of spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in the United States. Following the landmark approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, institutional interest has been piqued, and many analysts believe Ethereum is next in line. The prospect of easier access for traditional investors is a powerful magnet for capital. Robust Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum remains the foundational layer for a vast and dynamic ecosystem. From Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and the proliferation of Layer 2 scaling solutions, Ethereum’s utility continues to expand. This inherent utility and ongoing innovation make it an attractive long-term investment. Network Upgrades and Efficiency: Continuous improvements to the Ethereum network, such as the recent Dencun upgrade and upcoming enhancements like Pectra, are improving its scalability, security, and efficiency. These technical advancements reduce transaction costs and increase throughput, making the network more appealing for developers and users alike. Bitcoin’s Consolidation Phase: While Bitcoin remains the king of crypto, it has entered a period of consolidation after its post-halving rally and initial ETF excitement. This natural market cycle often sees capital flow from established assets like Bitcoin into higher-beta altcoins, particularly those with strong fundamentals like Ethereum, as investors seek new growth opportunities. Decoding the ETH/BTC Spot Volume Ratio: Why Does it Matter? The ETH/BTC spot volume ratio is more than just a number; it’s a critical barometer for market sentiment and capital flow. When this ratio rises above 1, as it has now, it signals a significant shift in investor preference. Historically, such movements have often preceded periods where altcoins, led by Ethereum, outperform Bitcoin. Consider the implications: Investor Rotation: A higher ratio indicates that a greater proportion of new capital and existing funds are being allocated to Ethereum rather than Bitcoin. This suggests investors are actively diversifying their portfolios or seeking higher potential returns in the altcoin market. Market Leadership: While Bitcoin often leads the initial phases of a bull run, Ethereum frequently takes the baton in subsequent phases, driving broader market rallies, especially across the altcoin spectrum. This recent surge in Ethereum spot volume could be a precursor to such a phase. Liquidity and Depth: Increased trading volume for Ethereum also signifies deeper liquidity, making it easier for large institutional players to enter and exit positions without significant price slippage. This enhanced liquidity further reinforces its position as a mature and attractive asset. Is This the Dawn of an Altcoin Season, Fueled by Ethereum’s Momentum? The question on every crypto investor’s mind is whether this surge in Ethereum spot volume is the harbinger of a full-blown altcoin season. While no one can predict the future with certainty, the current dynamics certainly paint a promising picture. An “altcoin season” typically occurs when altcoins, as a group, significantly outperform Bitcoin. Ethereum, being the largest altcoin by market capitalization and the backbone of many decentralized applications, often leads this charge. When ETH demonstrates strength, it often creates a ripple effect across the broader altcoin market, pulling smaller cap projects higher. However, it’s crucial to consider potential challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains dynamic. While progress is being made, unexpected regulatory hurdles could dampen market enthusiasm.

2025-07-23 16:12:11+00:00,From Islamabad to Israel: How Pakistan’s Crypto Pivot Is Reshaping the Global Crypto Narrative,"In May 2025, Pakistan quietly rewrote its crypto stance by launching the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA). This was a bold and unexpected move for a country that, just two years prior, declared cryptocurrencies would “never be legalized.” Tasked with licensing exchanges, setting standards for tokenization and mining, and aligning with global best practices, PVARA is now positioning Pakistan as one of the first movers in structured digital asset regulation across South Asia. The global ripple effect was immediate. Just a day later, Israel’s Knesset held its first informal parliamentary discussion on Bitcoin. While the session didn’t yield immediate policy proposals, it echoed many of the same questions that Pakistan is already beginning to tackle: How can decentralized technologies support trade, inclusion, and resilience in regions facing macroeconomic pressure? What does national security look like in a world where financial infrastructure is no longer tied to borders? Pakistan’s pivot has pushed even countries like India and Israel to think about their own crypto narratives. These conversations are surfacing at a pivotal moment. Bitcoin is trading above $115,000, driven by a renewed wave of institutional adoption, regulatory clarity in some markets, and post-conflict recalibration in geostrategic regions like the Middle East. At the same time, the U.S. is moving forward with comprehensive federal legislation on crypto, while countries like Turkey, Nigeria, and Argentina are recalibrating their own financial architectures in response to inflationary stress and currency volatility. Each of these countries, in their own way, is acknowledging the growing legitimacy and inevitability of decentralized financial systems. Pakistan isn’t alone in this shift. Nigeria has embraced regulatory sandboxes to encourage fintech experimentation. Argentina’s leadership is considering open frameworks to integrate stablecoins and crypto wallets into its national economy. India, meanwhile, is quietly reconsidering its hardline stance, as its burgeoning developer ecosystem and digital commerce sector push for policy reforms. But what makes Pakistan’s pivot particularly noteworthy is the pace and intentionality with which it moved from prohibition to policy. In under four months, the country transitioned from a total crypto ban to announcing a sovereign Bitcoin reserve, drafting legislation, setting up a new regulatory body, and inviting both domestic and international exchanges to seek licensing under its jurisdiction. All of this while signaling compliance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards and building institutional muscle for digital asset governance. This shift didn’t happen in a vacuum. It reflects broader generational and economic realities. With over 116 million internet users, 50,000 annual computer science graduates, and a digital freelance workforce of over 4 million, Pakistan is home to one of the most internet-native and globally connected populations in Asia. For many young Pakistanis, crypto isn’t some abstract investment vehicle — it’s a utility. A tool to receive remittances, pay for services, and store value in the face of a volatile rupee and limited access to foreign banking infrastructure. For the government, the pivot also serves a strategic purpose. By embracing structured regulation, Pakistan is asserting itself in a space where few developing countries have managed to lead. It’s a geopolitical signal: that digital sovereignty and economic inclusion can coexist. And emerging markets don’t have to wait for Washington or Brussels to set the tone. In fact, by working with nations like El Salvador, initiating knowledge-sharing agreements, and engaging directly with global crypto leaders, Pakistan is helping to write the next chapter of crypto diplomacy. As the world moves toward greater fragmentation in economic, political, and technological spheres, digital assets offer a rare, if still volatile, path toward borderless collaboration. Whether this moment triggers a global cascade of crypto legislation or merely inspires a season of experimentation, one thing is clear: crypto is no longer just an economic debate. It’s a strategic one. A matter of policy, sovereignty, and future-readiness. In 2025, the leaders may not be the usual suspects like Washington, Tel Aviv, or Brussels. It may very well be Islamabad.

In a statement released Wednesday, the company said $850 million in notes will be offered to institutional investors, with an option to raise an additional $150 million. The notes are due in 2032 and will be senior unsecured obligations. They will not bear interest and are subject to market conditions, meaning there is no certainty the offering will be completed or finalized as proposed. Use of Proceeds Includes Bitcoin and Debt Repayment Up to $50 million of the proceeds will go toward repurchasing Mara’s existing 1.00% convertible senior notes due in 2026. The remainder will support capped call transactions, new Bitcoin acquisitions, and general corporate needs. “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the company said in a regulatory filing. Bitcoin Strategy Remains Core Focus The announcement comes shortly after Mara completed a minority acquisition of Two Prime, an institutional asset adviser with $1.75 billion under management. This deal has increased the volume of Bitcoin Two Prime manages on Mara’s behalf.

The FED''s interest rate decision in July, which has kept interest rates steady since January, is eagerly awaited. With just one week left until the Fed announces its highly anticipated interest rate decision, Reuters conducted a survey with the participation of 105 economists. A majority of economists in a Reuters poll said the Fed''s independence was under threat from increasing political interference. According to the results, while there is uncertainty regarding interest rate cut expectations for 2025, no one expects an interest rate cut in July. More than 70% of economists in a Reuters poll conducted July 17-23 said they were concerned about the Fed''s independence due to political pressure. Ten people said they were very worried. The remaining 14 said they were not worried. All 105 economists said the Fed, which cut its key interest rate to 4.25%-4.50% in December, would leave interest rates steady in July. A 53% majority of economists (56 out of 105) predict a Fed rate cut in September, consistent with market pricing. However, there is still no clear consensus among economists on how much interest rates should be reduced by the end of 2025. At this point, about two-thirds of economists expect one or two rate cuts this year, while almost a fifth expect no cuts at all. “Tariffs could both increase inflation and slow the economy,” said Jonathan Millar, senior U.S. economist at Barclays. “The Fed doesn''t know exactly what the mix will be, and that''s reason enough to wait.” *This is not investment advice.

Through its upcoming Solaris Nova App, BTC-S will enable users to mine from their phones, tapping into both Proof-of-Work and Delegated Proof-of-Stake architecture to deliver robust rewards. This opens doors for retail investors previously excluded by expensive mining rigs or complex staking procedures. Why Bitcoin Solaris is Becoming the Talk of the Industry While Cardano investors hold onto incremental growth predictions, influencers are steering conversations toward Bitcoin Solaris as the true innovator. These crypto thought leaders have highlighted key areas where BTC-S is rewriting expectations: Crypto Vlog : Praised Bitcoin Solaris for its 10,000 TPS performance and next-gen scalability focus. Token Galaxy : Focused on how BTC-S combines accessibility with robust enterprise-grade tech. Crypto Show : Highlighted the project’s dual-layer consensus and mobile-first mining approach. Key Features Driving the Hype Over 10,000 TPS and 2-second finality through dual-layer architecture Hybrid consensus model combining Proof-of-Work security with Delegated Proof-of-Stake scalability Advanced reward systems recognize contribution score, device type, and task complexity Solana integration for cross-chain interoperability and rapid adoption Mobile-first mining through the upcoming Solaris Nova App The Presale Momentum: 21 Days Left Bitcoin Solaris is racing toward its launch with one of the most aggressive presale momentum stories in crypto this year. Over 15,000 users have already jumped in, raising more than $7.2M. With only around 2 weeks left before the presale closes and a confirmed $20 launch price, this is a moment of urgency. The current price sits at $12, with the next phase already lined up at $13. The potential 150% return is not just marketing hype; it is backed by technology, partnerships, and community traction. Bitcoin Solaris is offering something tangible beyond token speculation. Its real-world applications across DeFi, enterprise, gaming, healthcare, and education make this more than a trading asset; it is infrastructure for the blockchain-powered economy. The Fastest Growing Crypto of 2025 Isn’t a Meme, It’s BTC-S For Wallets and Token Delivery To receive your tokens on launch day, Bitcoin Solaris recommends using Trust Wallet or Metamask . These wallets are recommended for seamless token delivery after launch. Bitcoin Solaris Double Rewards Referral Program Bitcoin Solaris launches a dual-benefit referral system during its presale, rewarding both referrers and referred participants. How It Works Referrers get a 5% commission in BTC-S for every purchase through their referral link. Referred participants receive a 5% bonus on their token purchase. Getting Started Log in at BitcoinSolaris.com. Go to the Referrals section in your dashboard. Copy and share your unique referral link. Why It Matters By rewarding both sides, Bitcoin Solaris fosters community-driven growth and sustainable adoption.

2025-07-23 16:30:11+00:00,Bitcoin Holders Still Reluctant To Sell – Supply Active Data Shows Room For Upside,"Bitcoin remains in a tight consolidation range after setting a new all-time high above $123,000 just 10 days ago. The current range, between $117,000 and $120,000, reflects a pause in momentum as the market digests recent gains and prepares for its next major move. While volatility has cooled, underlying metrics suggest that the broader trend may still have room to run. Related Reading: Tron Outpaces Ethereum In Fee Revenue – TRX Burn Accelerates One key indicator drawing attention is the percentage of supply active in the past 180 days (% Supply Active). This metric has historically surged during major macro turning points. In spring 2024, as BTC approached $70,000, % Supply Active climbed to 20%. It rose again to 18% in December 2024, when Bitcoin first broke through the psychological $100,000 barrier. These spikes reflected long-dormant coins moving out of storage—often interpreted as early signals of broader distribution phases beginning. Currently, the market is showing only initial signs of renewed supply activity, suggesting that we may still be in the early stages of this cycle’s distribution phase. As long-term holders remain relatively inactive and Bitcoin trades near record levels, the stage may be set for further upside if accumulation resumes and new capital enters the market. Supply Activity Signals Early Stage Of Bitcoin Macro Expansion Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared key insights pointing to a potential early phase in Bitcoin’s ongoing macro cycle. According to Adler, supply activity began rising in June 2025 as BTC crossed the $100,000 mark. Over the past 30 days, this metric has climbed from negative territory to +2.4%, signaling the beginning of a shift in holder behavior. While the increase confirms early signs of distribution, it remains modest compared to previous cycle peaks. Historically, major bull markets see this 30-day % Supply Active rise dramatically. Adler highlights that the current pace lags behind prior peaks—like those seen when BTC reached $70,000 in spring 2024 or when it breached $100,000 in December 2024—suggesting that the market still has a considerable buffer before entering a heightened distribution phase. This delayed spike in activity implies that most long-term holders remain committed and are not yet ready to offload their coins. As Bitcoin consolidates near the $120,000 level, this growing yet restrained activity indicates a healthy cycle structure. Adler predicts that if BTC continues to climb and hold above $120,000, the 30-day % Supply Active will likely move into the 8–10% range. Ultimately, it could revisit the 18–20% zone seen at past distribution tops. Related Reading: Ethereum Big-Money Flow Hits 3-Year High With $100B In Weekly Volume BTC Holds Strong Above $115K Amid Consolidation The 12-hour Bitcoin chart reveals a clear consolidation phase following the recent all-time high. BTC is currently trading around $118,267, trapped in a tight range between the $122,077 resistance and the $115,724 support. Despite a minor rejection from the $120K area, the structure remains bullish as long as price holds above the 50 and 100-period SMAs, which are now aligned between $113K and $110K—signaling solid mid-term support. Volume shows decreasing momentum during this consolidation, typical of a healthy pause after a strong breakout. BTC previously surged above $120K on strong volume, but has since failed to establish a new high, instead forming a sideways pattern. This suggests market indecision or accumulation before the next leg. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Metrics Flash Mixed Signals: Monthly Inflows Rise And Daily Outflows Start Slowing A break above $122,000 could trigger the next push toward the $130K level, while a breakdown below $115,724 would open room for a deeper retrace, potentially toward the $113,000 area near the 50-SMA.

But for now, the conveyor belt is slowing. Farmers and flippers may need to pause or pivot. The meme factory isn’t broken, just winded. And in this quieter moment, long-term builders might finally get a shot to shine. Pumpdotfun’s slip below 10,000 daily launches may just be a blip, or it could be the first real sign of fatigue in a red-hot cycle. Either way, the next few weeks will be crucial. Memecoin markets move fast. Sentiment shifts in a flash. Watch closely. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

2025-07-23 16:44:55+00:00,MARA Bets Big on Bitcoin Again with $850 Million Debt Raise,"MARA Holdings is going all in. The publicly traded Bitcoin miner already holds over 50,000 BTC. Now, it’s adding more firepower. On Wednesday, MARA priced an $850 million private offering of zero-coupon, senior unsecured convertible notes due 2032. The deal is limited to qualified institutional buyers, who also get a 13-day option to purchase an additional $150 million in notes. The move gives MARA financial agility. First, it will retire $50 million of its existing 1% convertible senior notes due 2026. Then, it plans to deploy the bulk of proceeds toward capped-call hedges, fresh Bitcoin purchases, and general corporate purposes. The notes structure is smart and strategic. Since they’re zero-coupon, MARA avoids interest payments altogether. Investors can convert the notes into equity if MARA’s stock crosses a certain price threshold. If not, the company simply repays the principal in 2032—minimizing dilution and conserving cash in the interim. Shares of MARA currently trade near $18.21 on NASDAQ, giving the company a market cap around $6.35 billion , according to TradingView and CompaniesMarketCap . That valuation places MARA among the most valuable Bitcoin mining companies globally—both in market size and on-chain Bitcoin reserves. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself is roaring, recently trading above $118,600 per coin. Demand continues to run hot. Miners like MARA feed the rally—selling some BTC to fund operations, while tucking away the rest as long-term treasury assets. MARA CEO Fred Thiel has made the company’s strategy clear: play the long game. He’s said repeatedly that MARA won’t sell into weakness. Instead, it aims to become a digital asset treasury powerhouse. Critics, however, are wary. Some question the timing and growing debt load. They see the math: more BTC on the asset side, more notes on the liabilities. It’s a high-conviction bet—and not without risk. Still, institutional buyers seem intrigued. The structure offers them upside via potential equity conversion at a discount, while backing a miner with serious on-chain weight. MARA Holdings To Run On Two Strategies That $150 million add-on option gives MARA flexibility. If demand holds, it could push total proceeds to $1 billion . That could be tapped quickly—especially if market conditions remain favorable. Reaction across crypto Twitter was swift.

2025-07-23 17:08:38+00:00,Mara Holdings raise $1 billion in convertible notes to expand its BTC holdings,"Mara Holdings, a major crypto miner, said on Wednesday it plans to issue up to $1 billion of convertible senior notes to raise money for new Bitcoin purchases. According to its announcement , the company will offer $850 million of these notes to qualified institutional purchasers. The notes are due to mature in 2032. In addition, investors can purchase up to $150 million more in principal, which could raise the total proceeds to $1 billion if the option is exercised. Mara said the company plans to use up to $50 million of the net proceeds to repurchase a piece of its outstanding 1.00 percent convertible senior notes that mature in 2026. The balance of the funds will be set aside for capped‑call transaction fees, the purchase of Bitcoin at roughly $118,487 a coin, and general corporate expenses. The new notes will rank as Mara’s senior unsecured obligations and won’t carry any interest payments. The offering remains subject to conditions such as the market, the company said, and it has not set a final date for pricing or completion of the sale. Mara reiterated that BTC is central to its treasury strategy In its latest remarks, the company reiterated that Bitcoin is central to its treasury strategy and that accumulating digital currency is a key part of its long‑term plan for growth. This news follows Mara’s minority investment completion in Two Prime, an institutional adviser that oversees $1.75 billion in assets. The deal will significantly boost Bitcoin managed by Two Prime for Mara, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. In early June, Mara reported that its Bitcoin output rose by 35 percent in May, despite ongoing higher difficulty in mining and a rising network hashrate. Figures from late May released by the company also showed its annual revenue from mining exceeded $752 million, setting a new record for its operations. As of this publication, Mara is holding 50,000 BTC, serving as part of its digital asset reserve. With that amount, Mara ranks as the second-largest corporate BTC holder, behind Strategy, which reports 607,000 BTC in its own treasury. The announcement follows a late‑March filing in which Mara said it had agreements with institutional investors to sell $2 billion of its stock. “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the firm added. Trump Media acquired $2 billion in BTC again Trump Media, the parent of Truth Social, acquired about $2 billion in BTC this week and related securities to solidify its position as a company with a crypto treasury.

Mara Holdings, a major crypto miner, said on Wednesday it plans to issue up to $1 billion of convertible senior notes to raise money for new Bitcoin purchases. According to its announcement , the company will offer $850 million of these notes to qualified institutional purchasers. The notes are due to mature in 2032. In addition, investors can purchase up to $150 million more in principal, which could raise the total proceeds to $1 billion if the option is exercised. Mara said the company plans to use up to $50 million of the net proceeds to repurchase a piece of its outstanding 1.00 percent convertible senior notes that mature in 2026. The balance of the funds will be set aside for capped‑call transaction fees, the purchase of Bitcoin at roughly $118,487 a coin, and general corporate expenses. The new notes will rank as Mara’s senior unsecured obligations and won’t carry any interest payments. The offering remains subject to conditions such as the market, the company said, and it has not set a final date for pricing or completion of the sale. Mara reiterated that BTC is central to its treasury strategy In its latest remarks, the company reiterated that Bitcoin is central to its treasury strategy and that accumulating digital currency is a key part of its long‑term plan for growth. This news follows Mara’s minority investment completion in Two Prime, an institutional adviser that oversees $1.75 billion in assets. The deal will significantly boost Bitcoin managed by Two Prime for Mara, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. In early June, Mara reported that its Bitcoin output rose by 35 percent in May, despite ongoing higher difficulty in mining and a rising network hashrate. Figures from late May released by the company also showed its annual revenue from mining exceeded $752 million, setting a new record for its operations. As of this publication, Mara is holding 50,000 BTC, serving as part of its digital asset reserve. With that amount, Mara ranks as the second-largest corporate BTC holder, behind Strategy, which reports 607,000 BTC in its own treasury. The announcement follows a late‑March filing in which Mara said it had agreements with institutional investors to sell $2 billion of its stock. “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” the firm added. Trump Media acquired $2 billion in BTC again Trump Media, the parent of Truth Social, acquired about $2 billion in BTC this week and related securities to solidify its position as a company with a crypto treasury. It also allocated roughly $300 million for securities related to Bitcoin.

This strategy, prioritizing aggressive growth and deregulation, promises to reshape the AI landscape, impacting everything from critical infrastructure to innovation and even the competitive stance against global rivals like China. It’s a move that could have profound implications for the future of digital assets and the broader tech ecosystem. How Does Trump’s AI Strategy Prioritize Growth? The Trump administration’s AI strategy , as outlined in its much-anticipated AI Action Plan, marks a significant departure from previous cautious approaches. Instead of primarily focusing on addressing the risks of artificial intelligence, it champions rapid development, infrastructure expansion, and reduced bureaucracy. The core tenet of this Trump AI philosophy is clear: a resounding call to “Build, Baby, Build!” This aggressive stance downplays immediate concerns about AI’s potential harms, instead focusing on an ambitious build-out of data centers and related infrastructure. The administration envisions this as the definitive path to a “new golden age of human flourishing,” justifying significant taxpayer investment in the process. This forward-looking approach also includes initiatives for upskilling the American workforce and partnering with local governments to create jobs within the burgeoning data center sector, aiming to ensure that economic benefits are broadly distributed. Boosting AI Data Centers : What’s the Deregulatory Drive? A cornerstone of the Trump administration’s plan is the expedited development of AI data centers , semiconductor fabrication facilities, and robust power sources. The administration contends that existing environmental regulations, such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act, currently impede this crucial progress. To overcome these perceived obstacles, the plan advocates for streamlining permitting processes, creating categorical exclusions, and expanding the use of fast-track programs like FAST-41. This includes leveraging federal lands, even national parks and military bases, for critical infrastructure development. The strategy also addresses America’s energy grid stability, urging large power consumers, such as AI companies, to manage their consumption during critical grid periods. This point has drawn scrutiny, given past criticisms of companies like xAI and Meta for concentrating pollution in vulnerable communities with their energy-intensive operations. Navigating AI Regulation : Will States Lose Control? The AI Action Plan signals a clear intent to limit state-level AI regulation . While a controversial provision in the budget bill that would have barred states from regulating AI for 10 years was recently removed from Senate consideration, the Trump administration proposes alternative mechanisms to achieve similar aims. The plan suggests a direct linkage between states’ federal funding and their compliance with AI regulatory limits. Furthermore, it directs the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to evaluate whether state AI regulations interfere with its existing obligations and authorities, particularly concerning radio, television, and the internet, opening a potential avenue for federal intervention. On the federal level, the Office of Science and Technology Policy will solicit feedback from businesses and the public about any current federal regulations that might hinder AI innovation and adoption, with the ultimate goal of further deregulation. The Intensifying US China AI Race : What’s at Stake for National Security? Central to the Trump administration’s AI strategy is the intensifying US China AI race . The plan explicitly targets national security threats, aiming to prevent “adversarial technology,” such as Chinese-made chips and hardware, from entering the U.S. supply chain. It mandates federal agencies to work collaboratively to collect intelligence on foreign frontier AI projects that could threaten American national security. In one notable effort, the Department of Commerce is tasked with evaluating Chinese AI models for alignment with Chinese Communist Party talking points and censorship. “National security” is a recurring theme throughout the document, appearing 23 times, underscoring the deep integration of AI into U.S. defense and intelligence apparatus.

The company holds 607,770 Bitcoins worth ~$71.96 billion, while trading at a ~$120.87 billion market capitalization. The $84 billion ""42-42 Capital Plan"" aims to raise $42B in equity and $42B in debt to scale. A prolonged crypto winter could cripple MSTR’s capital flywheel, with $12B in liabilities and no organic cash flow to cover them. Despite $12B in liabilities, including debt and preferred stock, MSTR uses leverage to boost Bitcoin-per-share growth. Investment Thesis Since initiating coverage on MicroStrategy ( MSTR ), the stock has surged ~25%, far outperforming the S&P 500’s 9% price return. The analysis was focused on the company’s Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) accumulation strategy through capital markets that generated $15.7 billion in unrealized gains. Today, that thesis has evolved into a capital flywheel. Strategy’s main strength lies in its systematic use of equity and debt at a premium to its Bitcoin NAV that is allowing it to outperform even BTC itself. This strategy, combined with new fair-value accounting standards and $84 billion capital plans push MSTR as the most leveraged, and potentially rewarding, Bitcoin proxy. seekingalpha.com Strategy Targets Bitcoin Per Share Growth via $84 billion Capital Flywheel Strategy''s main strength is in its execution of a strategic capital-to-Bitcoin acquisition flywheel. This is far more than a simple corporate treasury strategy of buying and holding an asset. It is a self-reinforcing mechanism to leverage the public capital markets to systematically increase its Bitcoin holdings per share. The entire operation is predicated on the significant premium at which its stock trades relative to the net asset value (NAV) of its Bitcoin holdings. This premium expressed as the mNAV multiple (Market Capitalization divided by Bitcoin NAV) serves as the value-creation machine that separates Strategy from any passive investment vehicle, including the big spot Bitcoin ETFs. By converting its inflated equity value into additional Bitcoin, the company creates a narrative for investors that can continue to outpace the performance of Bitcoin itself. This flywheel is not a byproduct of its stock performance. It is an architected and transparently communicated corporate strategy that may continue to support its growth. strategy.com/charts The mechanics of this flywheel is in fundamental market arbitrage. Based on the provided data, Strategy''s market capitalization stands at ~ $120.87 billion with the market value of its 607,770 bitcoins is ~$71.96 billion as of writing. This yields an mNAV multiple of roughly 1.68x that means the market values the company at a 68% premium to its direct Bitcoin holdings. It is the gap that the company exploits. When Strategy executes an at-the-market (ATM) offering, as observed in its recent sale of 1.64 million shares for $736.4 million , it is effectively selling its equity at this 1.68x premium. For every dollar of underlying Bitcoin value that a new share represents, the company receives $1.68 in cash. This additional $0.68 refers to as a ""BTC Gain,"" that represents an immediate and direct value accretion for existing shareholders. The capital raised is then deployed to purchase more Bitcoin that is increasing the total size of the company''s treasury. Because the capital was raised at a premium, the number of Bitcoins acquired with that capital outpaces the dilutive effect on a value-for-value basis. In short, this is increasing the total amount of Bitcoin for each pre-existing share. strategy.com/history The Q1-FY25 earnings call reveals the $84 billion ""42-42 Capital Plan"" that is a framework to raise $42 billion in equity and $42 billion in fixed income . This plan solidifies the flywheel and signaling that the company intends to continue this process at scale.

2025-07-23 17:25:18+00:00,Unveiling Jim Cramer’s Bold Bitcoin & Ether Bet for His Kids,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling Jim Cramer’s Bold Bitcoin & Ether Bet for His Kids The financial world often buzzes with pronouncements from seasoned experts, but few spark as much debate and amusement as those from CNBC’s Mad Money host, Jim Cramer. In a move that has certainly turned heads, Jim Cramer recently declared his surprising desire to hold Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) for his children, viewing them as a crucial hedge against burgeoning U.S. debt. This statement is particularly intriguing given Cramer’s well-known, and sometimes contrarian, market forecasting track record. But what exactly drives this unexpected pivot towards digital assets, and what does it mean for the broader discussion around cryptocurrency as a legitimate investment for the future? Why Jim Cramer Sees Bitcoin and Ether as a Hedge? Jim Cramer’s rationale for embracing digital assets like Bitcoin and Ether is rooted in a fundamental concern about the future of traditional finance, specifically the escalating U.S. national debt. A “hedge” in financial terms is an investment intended to offset potential losses or gains that may be incurred by a companion investment. In this context, Cramer views Bitcoin and Ether as potential safeguards against the devaluation of fiat currency and the erosion of purchasing power that could result from unchecked government spending and increasing debt burdens. Inflationary Pressures: As national debt grows, governments may resort to printing more money, which can lead to inflation. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin with its capped supply, are often seen as a hedge against inflation, similar to gold. Decentralization: Unlike traditional currencies controlled by central banks, Bitcoin and Ether operate on decentralized networks, making them less susceptible to government interference or policy shifts that could impact their value. Store of Value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” serves as a robust store of value due to its scarcity and global accessibility, preserving wealth across generations. Long-Term Vision: Cramer’s emphasis on holding these assets for his children underscores a long-term investment perspective, suggesting he believes in their enduring value proposition beyond short-term market volatility. This perspective aligns with a growing sentiment among some investors who are seeking alternatives to traditional assets in an increasingly uncertain economic landscape. The idea that digital assets could serve as a modern-day financial ark against the flood of national debt is gaining traction, even if the volatility of these assets remains a significant consideration. The Jim Cramer Effect: Navigating Market Predictions Jim Cramer is undeniably a polarizing figure in financial media. His enthusiastic, often theatrical, market predictions have earned him a loyal following, but also a reputation for being a “contra-indicator.” This phenomenon, humorously dubbed the “Jim Cramer effect,” suggests that the opposite of his predictions often comes true. This makes his recent endorsement of Jim Cramer Bitcoin and Ether all the more fascinating for observers. For years, Cramer has offered advice across various asset classes, from stocks to commodities. While he has had notable successes, some of his more high-profile calls have famously gone awry, leading to the creation of inverse Cramer ETFs and online memes. This history prompts a critical question: should investors take his crypto endorsement seriously, or is it another signal to do the opposite? It’s crucial to differentiate between an individual’s personal investment philosophy and general market advice. Cramer’s decision to hold Bitcoin and Ether for his children speaks to his personal conviction about long-term wealth preservation, rather than a short-term trading tip. His evolving stance on cryptocurrencies also reflects a broader shift in mainstream financial perception, where once-skeptical figures are beginning to acknowledge the potential of digital assets. Ultimately, the “Jim Cramer effect” serves as a reminder for all investors to conduct their own thorough research and not rely solely on any single personality’s pronouncements, regardless of their prominence. Personal financial decisions, especially regarding volatile assets like cryptocurrencies, should always be based on individual risk tolerance, financial goals, and independent analysis. Understanding Digital Assets: Bitcoin and Ether’s Role To fully grasp Jim Cramer’s interest, it’s essential to understand what Bitcoin and Ether are and why they stand out in the vast digital asset landscape. Both are foundational cryptocurrencies, but they serve different, albeit sometimes overlapping, purposes.

The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to reclaim $118,000 and reach $119,980 on Tuesday. However, it could not cross $120,000 and retreated during the ongoing session. BTC is down 1.48% during the ongoing session, trading around $118,201. Bitcoin ETFs Snap 12-Day Inflow Streak Spot Bitcoin ETFs broke their 12-day inflow streak amid profit-taking, registering a net outflow of $131.5 million on Monday. The 12-day inflow streak had seen investors pour $6.6 billion into the ETFs. ARK Invest saw the largest outflow, shedding $77.6 million, followed by Grayscale’s GBTC, which registered $36.7 million worth of inflows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC registered outflows of around $12.75 million. Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL also registered nominal outflows of $1.91 million and $2.48 million. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s IBIT did not register any inflows or outflows. The cumulative net inflows stand at a healthy $54.62 billion, while total net assets across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stand at $151 billion, 6.52% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. The outflows came as investors and institutions locked in their profits to manage risk. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, stated, “The recent ETF outflows reflect profit-taking near the highs and measured institutional rebalancing to lock in gains.” Strategy Owns 3% of Bitcoin (BTC) Supply Michael Saylor’s Strategy owns 3% of the Bitcoin (BTC) supply after completing its latest purchase of the asset earlier this week. The firm announced its latest purchase earlier this week, acquiring 6,220 BTC for $739 million, taking its total Bitcoin holdings to 607,770 BTC , worth $72 billion at current prices. Strategy has used a combination of common and preferred shares, along with debt, to fund its Bitcoin purchases. The company began accumulating the asset in late 2020 as a hedge against inflation. In a separate announcement, Strategy stated that it planned to offer 5 million variable-rate Series A perpetual Stretch preferred shares to finance future Bitcoin purchases. Bitcoin (BTC) Unlikely To Hit $200,000 In 2025 Glassnode lead analyst James Check believes Bitcoin is unlikely to reach $200,000 this year as buying volume is not increasing enough to push prices higher. The observation comes amid several industry executives predicting a rally to $200,000. Check stated in an interview, “How on earth can we be going up when there is no volume? $200,000 in six months is a big move — that’s a big move.” Check added that a rally would double Bitcoin’s current market capitalization of around $2.38 trillion. However, he said he does not see such a move materializing until volumes increase. “Could it happen? Absolutely. Is it likely to happen? Very improbable. Until I see that volume kick in, until I feel a bit more confident, I am certainly not going to put on any levered positions. I’m probably not going to go out on the risk curve until I see that the market is stabilized.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) failed to reclaim $120,000 on Tuesday despite building on Monday’s positive start. The flagship cryptocurrency rallied to an intraday high of $119,603 on Monday before losing momentum and settling at $117,387. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rose over 2%, crossing $119,000. However, it fell short of the $120,000 mark, settling at $119,980 before declining during the ongoing session. While BTC continues consolidating below $120,000, market analysts believe the bull cycle has some way to run. According to analytics firm Bitcoin Vector, although momentum has slowed, on-chain metrics indicate that the bullish structure remains intact. The firm stated in a post on X, “Momentum has cooled, but structure and fundamentals remain solid. This isn’t a top. It’s a coiled setup with support beneath it.” Bitcoin Vector explained that with the BTC price compressed, fundamentals have paused and are not weakening. Buyers could simply be waiting for confirmation of the breakout. Meanwhile, Swissblock analyzed Bitcoin’s short-term holder (STH) cost basis, stating that STHs were active and not exhausted. The STH cost basis is the average purchase price of investors who have held BTC for less than 155 days. According to Swissblocks, the price reached the “heated” band of this metric on July 14, but did not push into the overheated zone. Swissblock added, “Profit-taking is present, but the STH risk zone at $138K hasn’t been reached. This suggests there''s still room for expansion before we see any panic selling or euphoria.” BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising nearly 2% to $118,626. It soared past $120,000 on Monday, surging to a new all-time high of $123,091 before declining and settling at $119,716, ultimately registering a 0.92% increase.

He said that the SEC was initially hesitant. They asked Teucrium and others to withdraw their filings, citing low liquidity in the futures market. Sal recalled that the government’s stance at the time forced firms like his to comply. Yet, he and his team continued to track the market closely. When they believed liquidity had improved, they refiled. SEC Changes the Rules Midway Teucrium filed its Bitcoin futures ETF under the 1933 Act, which came with a long 270-day approval timeline. Later that same year, former SEC ChairmanGary Gensler changed the rules and allowed filings under the 1940 Act, a quicker, 75-day process commonly used for mutual funds. Many large firms like BlackRock and Fidelity jumped in under this structure and got approvals faster, even though Teucrium had filed first. Talking to Thinking Crypto, Sal described this sudden shift as “very disconcerting,” explaining how it cost his firm valuable market opportunities. Despite this, Teucrium’s approved filing played a key role in Grayscale’s legal battle against the SEC. Sal said that Teucrium’s approval was referenced in the lawsuit, which Grayscale ultimately won.. Why Teucrium Is Betting on XRP Sal also shared why his firm has now filed for a leveraged XRP ETF, called “Double XRP.” While he doesn’t consider himself a fan of coins like Ethereum or Solana, he understands and supports the mission behind XRP. According to him, Ripple’s focus on modernizing cross-border payments and replacing the outdated SWIFT system is both practical and powerful. He believes Ripple has consistently demonstrated professionalism and long-term strategy, particularly in improving the speed and efficiency of asset transfers. He said, “Anything that speeds up the system makes sense.” Rather than compete head-to-head with big firms like BlackRock and Fidelity for a basic spot XRP ETF, Teucrium filed for a more specialized leveraged XRP ETF.

2025-07-23 17:30:49+00:00,"Binance Unrealized Profits Hit A Record 60,000 Bitcoin Despite Falling Reserves","Binance Coin (BNB) just hit a new all-time high, surging to $804 a few hours ago as momentum in select altcoins continues despite broader market consolidation. While Bitcoin and Ethereum enter a period of sideways movement, BNB is breaking out with renewed strength. This bullish move comes amid strong fundamentals tied to Binance’s growing profitability and market dominance. According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, Binance’s unrealized profit on its BTC reserves has climbed to a record 60,000 BTC, marking a new all-time high. This surge in unrealized gains is particularly notable given that Binance’s BTC reserves have actually been declining steadily since September 2024. As institutional demand grows and altcoins attract renewed interest, BNB’s performance may be a leading signal of what’s to come for the broader market. With Bitcoin and Ethereum stabilizing above key zones, Binance Coin stands out as a top performer, underpinned by rising exchange profitability and investor confidence. The coming days could be pivotal in confirming whether this move has room to run. Strategic Reserves: What Binance’s BTC Holdings Reveal Top analyst Darkfost has shared critical insights into Binance’s Bitcoin reserves, shedding light on the strategic decisions underpinning the platform’s operations. According to Darkfost, Binance’s core BTC reserve—primarily used to support exchange activity and the BNB Chain ecosystem—has declined from approximately 631,000 BTC in September 2024 to 574,000 BTC today. This trend underscores a calculated shift in reserve strategy rather than weakness, aligning with broader market changes and demand dynamics. In addition to this strategic reserve, Binance holds roughly 16,000 BTC in custodial wallets. These funds serve a specific purpose: backing the BTCB token and fulfilling user demand for tokenized Bitcoin within the BNB Chain environment. This structure allows Binance to maintain flexibility while ensuring liquidity and transparency across its ecosystem. Tracking these reserves offers a unique window into macro sentiment. Declining exchange reserves often point to increasing confidence among long-term holders, as more Bitcoin is withdrawn for cold storage or long-term holding. This behavior signals growing conviction that prices will continue rising. Notably, despite the reduction in total BTC holdings, the value of Binance’s remaining reserves has soared. The continued rally in Bitcoin’s price has pushed Binance’s unrealized profit to a record 60,000 BTC. This divergence, falling reserves yet rising profits, highlights the strength of this market phase and Binance’s ability to navigate it profitably. As the market matures, Binance’s reserve data will remain a valuable barometer of institutional and investor behavior. Price Analysis: Breakout Pushes BNB Into Price Discovery Binance Coin (BNB) has officially broken into uncharted territory, reaching a new all-time high of $804. The chart shows a sustained and aggressive uptrend, with BNB surging from the $670 zone in early July to nearly $800 in just weeks. This move confirms bullish momentum and strong market confidence. All key moving averages—50-day ($671), 100-day ($652), and 200-day ($642)—are trending upward, and price is well above all of them. This alignment confirms a robust bullish structure. The recent price surge has also been supported by a noticeable rise in trading volume, further validating the breakout. BNB has cleared all major resistance levels and is now in price discovery, meaning it’s exploring new highs with little technical resistance overhead. The clean break above the $720–740 zone was a key trigger for acceleration. Traders should now watch the $780–790 area as short-term support. As long as BNB holds this range, the bullish trend remains intact. With no historical resistance ahead, momentum could push toward $850 or higher—especially if market sentiment stays strong and BTC/ETH remain in consolidation.

Haywood invoked Rule 431 to stay the order, sending the decision to the full Commission for further review and freezing the conversion process pic.twitter.com/aPjZlHEvdV — Martyn Lucas Investor (@MartynInvestor) July 23, 2025 The reversal occurred despite the SEC finding the proposal consistent with Exchange Act requirements for preventing fraudulent practices and protecting investors. The dramatic policy flip comes as 72 crypto-related ETF applications await regulatory approval from providers including Grayscale, CoinShares, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck. Bloomberg Intelligence assigns 95% approval odds for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin ETFs this year, while existing Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs continue attracting billions in institutional inflows. Ethereum ETFs recorded $533.87 million in net inflows on July 22 , marking the third-largest single-day inflow since inception, while Bitcoin ETFs experienced $67.93 million in outflows. Regulatory Confusion Emerges as Multi-Asset Approval Process Stalls The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF approval represented a major expansion beyond existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products, with holdings weighted by market capitalization and monthly rebalancing. As of June 30, Bitcoin comprised 78.72% and Ethereum 11.10% of the proposed fund, with the remaining eight cryptocurrencies making up the rest. The SEC’s accelerated approval process typically applies to non-controversial rule changes that align with existing regulations. The Commission found Bitwise’s 85% allocation requirement for previously approved components to be sufficient to mitigate fraud and manipulation risks, consistent with prior 80% thresholds for similar products. NYSE Arca’s rule amendments would have allowed Trust Units issued by limited liability companies and explicitly permitted index-based investments. The changes included conforming corporate governance policies and eliminating shareholder meeting requirements, aligning with existing treatment of investment vehicles. The Division of Trading and Markets took the initial approval action under delegated authority before senior Commission officials intervened with the stay order. The reversal suggests disagreement within the SEC about multi-asset crypto product approvals despite technical rule compliance. Coinbase Custody Trust Company would have served as a digital asset custodian, while Bank of New York Mellon provided cash custody and administration services. The ETF structure included cash-based creation and redemption in 10,000-share units, with daily net asset value calculations using CF Benchmarks pricing data. Institutional Demand Surges Despite Regulatory Uncertainty Existing crypto ETFs continue to experience massive institutional adoption despite regulatory confusion. Ethereum ETFs have attracted $8.32 billion in cumulative inflows since their inception, with BlackRock’s ETHA leading Tuesday’s surge with $426.22 million. The fund now manages over $10 billion in assets, representing 2.24% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. Bitcoin ETFs hold a total of $154.77 billion in assets , despite recent outflows, accounting for approximately 6.5% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $7.51 million in inflows, while Ark Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB experienced outflows exceeding $30 million each. The pending ETF pipeline includes applications for Dogecoin, MELANIA, TRUMP, and other meme tokens alongside serious institutional products. Most recently, 21Shares filed for an ONDO token ETF that tracks the native token of Ondo Finance, a layer-1 blockchain designed for institutional finance and the tokenization of real-world assets.

Regulatory Confusion Emerges as Multi-Asset Approval Process Stalls The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF approval represented a major expansion beyond existing Bitcoin and Ethereum products, with holdings weighted by market capitalization and monthly rebalancing. As of June 30, Bitcoin comprised 78.72% and Ethereum 11.10% of the proposed fund, with the remaining eight cryptocurrencies making up the rest. The SEC’s accelerated approval process typically applies to non-controversial rule changes that align with existing regulations. The Commission found Bitwise’s 85% allocation requirement for previously approved components to be sufficient to mitigate fraud and manipulation risks, consistent with prior 80% thresholds for similar products. NYSE Arca’s rule amendments would have allowed Trust Units issued by limited liability companies and explicitly permitted index-based investments. The changes included conforming corporate governance policies and eliminating shareholder meeting requirements, aligning with existing treatment of investment vehicles. The Division of Trading and Markets took the initial approval action under delegated authority before senior Commission officials intervened with the stay order. The reversal suggests disagreement within the SEC about multi-asset crypto product approvals despite technical rule compliance. Coinbase Custody Trust Company would have served as a digital asset custodian, while Bank of New York Mellon provided cash custody and administration services. The ETF structure included cash-based creation and redemption in 10,000-share units, with daily net asset value calculations using CF Benchmarks pricing data. Institutional Demand Surges Despite Regulatory Uncertainty Existing crypto ETFs continue to experience massive institutional adoption despite regulatory confusion. Ethereum ETFs have attracted $8.32 billion in cumulative inflows since their inception, with BlackRock’s ETHA leading Tuesday’s surge with $426.22 million. The fund now manages over $10 billion in assets, representing 2.24% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. Bitcoin ETFs hold a total of $154.77 billion in assets , despite recent outflows, accounting for approximately 6.5% of Bitcoin’s market capitalization. Grayscale’s GBTC recorded $7.51 million in inflows, while Ark Invest’s ARKB and Bitwise’s BITB experienced outflows exceeding $30 million each. The pending ETF pipeline includes applications for Dogecoin, MELANIA, TRUMP, and other meme tokens alongside serious institutional products. Most recently, 21Shares filed for an ONDO token ETF that tracks the native token of Ondo Finance, a layer-1 blockchain designed for institutional finance and the tokenization of real-world assets. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund conversion to ETF status faced similar approval-then-uncertainty patterns, with speculation mounting about potential stays.

2025-07-23 17:58:21+00:00,The Node: Tim Draper on Bitcoin’s Gravitational Pull,"Central to Draper’s worldview is the notion that bitcoin is simply better technology than any government-issued currency. Roughly 20% of the global adult population is unbanked, according to the World Bank; Bitcoin enables such people to make online payments, and manage their savings . It’s also incredibly efficient in terms of sending money abroad . A wire transfer will usually take three to five business days (if not more) to arrive, whereas a Bitcoin transaction will generally be sorted within 10 minutes to an hour (or a couple of seconds if you’re using the Lightning Network). This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here . Still, Bitcoin is now a 16-year-old piece of technology, and there are plenty of sleeker, more efficient blockchain projects out there. Yet, Draper says that anything new in crypto will eventually make its way back to Bitcoin. “There''s this gravitational pull towards Bitcoin. All of the innovation from other tokens is now getting ported over Bitcoin. It’s like Microsoft with WordPerfect and Lotus 123,” Draper said, referring to how the computer company developed its own word processor (Microsoft Word) and spreadsheet program (Microsoft Excel) by replicating technologies from other firms. “Smart contracts, DeFi, that''s all moving over to Bitcoin. And bitcoin’s market share has gone from 40% in 2022 to 61% today ,” Draper said. “If you''re a retailer, you put up a sign that says, ‘We take bitcoin.’ You''re not going to say ‘We take gozo coin,’ or whatever.” The technology’s superiority is one of the reasons why the federal government’s prior hostility to crypto was so maddening, Draper said. How can you compete if you don’t make use of all of the innovations at the tip of your fingers? The U.S. probably lost 10 years of value in the whole ordeal, according to Draper, and while the new Trump administration is firmly pro-innovation, the country still needs to catch up. U.S. users are still geofenced by a lot of crypto projects; nor can they receive airdrops, or tokenize things with the same liberty as most people around the globe. “I met with the leaders of El Salvador and I got jealous,” Draper said. “ Everyone on the street knows how a smart contract works. They build DAOs. They have blockchain everything. It''s crazy. El Salvador, which used to be one of the poorest places in the world, could end up being like Singapore.” Draper’s thesis, down the line, is that retailers ( already slowly adopting bitcoin in some parts of the world ) will someday refuse to accept payments in U.S. dollars. “I don''t know how long it''ll take to get there, maybe 10 years.

2025-07-23 18:04:59+00:00,USDT Distribution Between Tron and Ethereum Shows Patterns Tied to Bitcoin’s Price,"The battle for stablecoin dominance has intensified amidst the broader market rally. New data suggests that the distribution of Tether (USDT) supply between Tron and Ethereum networks appears to alongside Bitcoin’s price cycles. USDT Rivalry In its latest post, CryptoQuant revealed that Tron’s USDT supply was just a fraction of Ethereum’s, with a ratio of 0.3 in 2019. However, by 2022-2023, the ratio climbed above 1.0, as a result of Tron’s rise due to lower transaction fees. Interestingly, Tron first surpassed Ethereum’s USDT supply in 2021, which coincided with Bitcoin’s $64,000 peak. In the current cycle, the ratio has declined as Bitcoin crossed $100,000. CryptoQuant explained that this indicates investors lean towards Ethereum for its security during bull markets despite higher fees. Data also shows that while Ethereum initially led USDT supply growth, Tron’s supply surged to $60 billion and exceeded $80 billion in 2025, demonstrating massive adoption. These supply peaks align with Bitcoin highs, which means that USDT expansion often mirrors broader market optimism. Ethereum remains a stable anchor during periods of volatility and benefits from its established DeFi infrastructure. The USDT supply delta further revealed a notable change. Until 2021, the delta was negative and favored Ethereum. However, it flipped positive in 2022-2023, signaling Tron’s leadership with an edge of $3-8 billion. In 2025, the delta briefly turned negative, indicating Ethereum’s resurgence, but has since swung back, with Tron now holding $3.9 billion more USDT than Ethereum. USDT Transfers Tron’s growing dominance extends to USDT transactions as well. On June 29, the network handled $6.94 million in USDT transfers, which is more than five times Ethereum’s $1.31 million on the same day. This surge was indicative of its appeal in emerging markets facing hyperinflation and currency instability, where TRC-20 USDT functions as a practical alternative banking system accessible via mobile devices in countries like Venezuela, Turkey, Nigeria, and Argentina. In addition, major crypto exchanges now default to TRC-20 for USDT deposits and withdrawals. Beyond transactional dominance, Tron is reportedly exploring a public listing through a reverse merger with SRM Entertainment, although rumors of Eric Trump’s involvement have been denied.

2025-07-23 18:25:59+00:00,Bitwise''s Matt Hougan pins ETH recent performance to a demand shock caused by institutional demand,"Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has attributed Ethereum’s recent rally to a sustained “demand shock” from institutional investors and ETH treasury companies. In a thread on X, Hougan highlighted these as the key reasons behind ETH’s massive surge. According to Hougan , Ethereum exchange-traded products (ETPs) and corporate treasuries have bought 2.83 million ETH, valued at more than $10 billion, since the middle of May. This represents around 32 times the amount of Ethereum issued during the same period. He said: “ETH is on a tear. After trading steadily downward for the first four months of the year, it has rebounded strongly. It’s up 50%+ in the past month and more than 150% since its lows in April. The reason? Overwhelming demand from ETPs and Corporate Treasuries.” Hougan noted that this marks the start of what he identified as a “classic demand shock,” adding that spot Ethereum ETPs accounted for over $5 billion of these purchases. The Bitwise executive added that he expects demand to increase even further, noting that ETH ETPs have bought less than 12% of the assets that Bitcoin ETPs have bought. ETH ETFs surge in net flow is a major contributor to ETH performance (Source: Matt Hougan) The CIO projects an additional $20 billion in institutional purchases over the next 12 months. This would equate to 5.33 million ETH entering long-term holdings at current market prices. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s projected issuance over the same period is expected to be only 800,000 ETH, suggesting a potential 7-to-1 demand-to-supply ratio. However, he acknowledged that ETH is not the same as Bitcoin, that the price is not driven primarily by demand and supply, and that it does not share ‘Bitcoin capped long term issuance’. Still, he noted that ETH will go higher for now as there is more demand for ETH than supply. Meanwhile, Hougan added that growing momentum around stablecoins and tokenized assets will likely drive further ETH demand. He noted that as traditional assets such as stocks and fiat move onto Ethereum’s programmable ledger, it strengthens the narrative of ETH as essential infrastructure. Ethereum rebounding after early setback Meanwhile, Ethereum is rapidly regaining momentum. In the post, Matt Hougan highlighted that ETH has surged more than 65 % over the past month and 160 % since April, marking a strong rebound from early‑year weakness. With the gains, ETH is back in the green with 7.63% yearly gains. Although the asset is down 2% in the past 24 hours, it has reached its weekly peak of $3,800. However, many believe the price correction that has sent its price careening back to $3,600 is only a minor correction after the recent surge. According to crypto analyst Dan Crypto, Ethereum is not overheated yet, and any correction in price will be minimal because its current rally compares to previous rallies in March 2024 and November 2024. He said: “Looking at a slightly bigger frame, compared to the overheating in the futures market in March 2024 and November 2024, the current level is way too small. Even if a correction comes, it’s likely to be shallow and short.” The analyst further observed that the current Ethereum cycle has been sluggish despite being in an upcycle. He acknowledged that ETH has already reached what seems to be a bottom in this cycle. Therefore, the only way for ETH is for the price to go up. Analysts warn of upcoming volatility Meanwhile, the resurgence in ETH value has led to increasing sentiments about the incoming altcoin season within the crypto community. With several chatters on X (formerly Twitter) about the altcoins season, analysts have warned about potential market volatility. According to Santiment analysts, crypto users should be prepared for volatility in the recent trends, adding that prices tend to increase mostly when the crowd does not expect it. The firm wrote: “When the crowd begins to perpetuate that we are in “altseason”, beware of some upcoming volatility. Crypto prices historically move up most prominently during periods of crowd disbelief.” Interestingly, Ethereum’s recent performance came amidst crowd sentiment that “it is over.” Santiment noted that markets usually move in the opposite direction from retail expectations.

2025-07-23 18:30:00+00:00,Bitcoin (BTC) Consolidates as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Wins Over Whale Investors,"Bitcoin (BTC) remains stable in consolidation, whereas real-world market ripple effects are created by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which currently draws heavyweight whale investors. Mutuum Finance price is $0.03 in 5th presale stage, with more than 85% sold out. Phase 5 investors will enjoy 100% return on investment when token lists. More than $12.9 million has been raised and there are more than 13,900 early investors. The token price of presale Phase 6 will be increased to $0.035, and that’s a 16.67% return on investment at Phase 5. Mutuum Finance is already among the top-watched altcoins in the market in 2025. Bitcoin Consolidates After All-Time Highs Bitcoin (BTC) at $118,000 is experiencing consolidation after the cryptocurrency reached close to its present all-time high of $123,000 last week. The cryptocurrency has remained in a range of $116,000 to $123,000 and the speculators have been holding out for a breakout sign. Robust ETF inflows and continued levels of support are presented by analysts as the cause of the slowdown, with the focus now shifting to whether BTC can penetrate $125,000 in subsequent weeks. This phase of consolidation follows as the demand of the investors also increases for upcoming projects like MUTM. Strong Investor Demand Drives Mutuum Presale Over $12.9M Mutuum Finance presale has already attracted more than 13900 investors and is already over the $12.9 million mark. More than 85% of the tokens in phase 5 have been bought by investors. This indicates greater confidence of the investors in the success of the project in the near future as well as its better future. Mutuum Empowers DeFi Security with CertiK-Supported Bug Bounty As its second move towards security and openness, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also started an Official Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The project will be rewarding the amount of $50,000 USDT to participants who find likely bugs in the program. The role of bounty program is to provide fair coverage for all the classes of vulnerabilities. It is divided into four severity classes; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. Mutuum Finance Launches Huge Token Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is even organizing a $100,000 giveaway where the users will be awarded the prize pool and will receive MUTM tokens, each worth $10,000. The top 50 holders of Mutuum Finance will also be rewarded by its new leaderboard system. Bonus tokens will be awarded when the users level up. Mutuum Finance: A New Model of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining lending in DeFi by creating a platform offering full asset ownership to customers. It’s an ongoing multi-purpose double-lending platform created through the combination of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model. Smart contracts are used for P2C lending pool access. The system responds based on the prevailing market condition, which is something that is mitigating lenders’ revenue volatility and the economic instability of the borrower. By removing the middlemen, the P2P model is assuming the cost of direct lending, which is convenient for highly volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly closing in on the whale investors, with $12.9M raised, 13,900+ holders, and Phase 5 already 85% sold out at $0.03. The presale price rises to $0.035 in Phase 6, giving early investors a direct 16.67% profit, and a 100% ROI in wait for listing at $0.06. With basing Bitcoin, whales are quietly building up MUTM as the next giant DeFi play. Lock up your tokens now before Phase 5 sells out.

2025-07-23 18:37:31+00:00,MARA Holdings Announces $850M Offering to Buy Bitcoin,"MARA Holdings, Inc., a leading Bitcoin (BTC) mining company, has announced that it plans to offer $850 million principal amount of 0.00% convertible senior notes due in 2032. This move aims to strengthen the company’s financial position and support its long-term growth. According to the press release , the offering will be available only to qualified institutional investors, as defined by Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. MARA Holdings Convertible Notes Offering Convertible senior notes represent a form of debt security that offers investors the option to convert their holdings into equity at a future date, while also accruing interest. For MARA, these convertible senior notes will not earn interest (other than special interest in limited circumstances), unless they are converted, repurchased, or redeemed earlier. The special interest on the notes, if any, will be paid semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 each year, starting from February 2026. Notably, this zero-coupon structure enables MARA Holdings to raise capital without incurring immediate cash interest payments, thereby providing them with greater flexibility to manage their operational cash flow. Investors have the flexibility to either hold these senior, unsecured notes until they mature or convert them into shares of MARA Holdings. Additionally, the company will offer the initial buyers a 13-day option, starting from the issue date, to purchase up to an additional $150 million. MARA Holdings Strategic Financial Maneuvering MARA plans to use up to $50 million from the sale of the notes to repurchase some of its existing 1.00% convertible senior notes, which are due in 2026. The remaining funds from this offering will likely be used to purchase additional Bitcoin and for general business purposes. This may include paying off more debt, improving operations, or making strategic investments in blockchain technology and AI-driven solutions. Recall that the company reported a noticeable drop in Bitcoin production for June 2025 . Despite the dip, MARA remains focused on its long-term strategy. It plans to keep expanding its mining capacity and energy infrastructure as part of its broader goal to lead in the fast-growing Bitcoin mining industry. Similarly, the company is aiming high, with plans to reach a hash rate of 75 EH/s by the end of 2025. “Invest-and-Forget” Approach for Bitcoin Earlier in the year, Fred Thiel, CEO of MARA Holdings, suggested a straightforward strategy for retail investors: invest in BTC regularly and let it be. In his words, “My recommendation to my kids, for example, is to put a little aside every month in BTC and let it grow over time.” He emphasized that over two ot four years, this method can yield significant returns, noting Bitcoin’s average annual growth of 29% to over 50%. Thiel acknowledges the volatility inherent in Bitcoin compared to traditional financial assets. He remained confident in the cryptocurrency’s potential to outperform over extended periods. It is worth noting that MARA Holdings mirrors its CEO’s bullish stance on Bitcoin .

In a new interview on CNBC Television, PNC CEO Bill Demchak says that the company’s partnership with Coinbase – which started years ago but advanced earlier this week – will finally be able to flourish due to a friendlier economic and regulatory landscape. “We actually went down the path with Coinbase several years ago to do something similar. And we’re enabling US digital payments through Coinbase on our systems. We’re also using our bank capabilities for fiat, our treasury management services for them. So we’re doing two things at once. But we looked at this a bunch of years ago. And then we kind of had the crypto winter. And we had prohibitions from regulators to, you know, even spell crypto. And everything went on hold. Now we’ve got the Genius Act through and there’s progress and regulators back and forth have dropped their restrictions on our ability to work with crypto. So off we go.” According to Demchak, PNC will not be creating its own stablecoin; rather, it will look at serving as a wallet for any token its clients would want to use. “Coinbase is our backbone. If there is an industry-led stablecoin, it could be traded in that wallet or any of the other ones. So we’re not making a decision. We’re not going to produce a stablecoin per se, certainly not in our own name, but we’ll be a wallet, a provider for any coin that any of our clients want to use.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

For those navigating the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency, understanding these broader movements is not just advisable, but essential. A significant development recently emerged with the conclusion of the Russia Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul, a pivotal moment that, while brief in its initial reporting, carries profound implications for stability and investor sentiment. As reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, citing Russian news agency TASS, these high-stakes discussions have wrapped up, leaving market participants to ponder the next steps and their potential impact on everything from traditional stocks to digital assets. The Significance of Russia Ukraine Peace Talks: A Glimpse into Geopolitical Chess The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has undeniably been one of the most impactful geopolitical events of recent times, triggering widespread humanitarian concerns, energy crises, and significant economic disruptions. Against this backdrop, any dialogue aimed at de-escalation, no matter how preliminary, captures immediate global attention. The Russia Ukraine peace talks in Istanbul represented a flicker of hope, a potential pathway towards resolving a conflict that has cast a long shadow over international relations and global economies. Humanitarian Imperative: The primary goal of any peace talks is to alleviate suffering and protect civilian lives. Economic Stability: A resolution could stabilize commodity prices, ease supply chain pressures, and foster economic recovery. Geopolitical Realignments: The outcome could reshape alliances and power dynamics on the global stage. Investor Confidence: Reduced uncertainty often translates to increased investor confidence across all asset classes. These talks, even if not immediately yielding a full resolution, are crucial for gauging the willingness of both sides to engage diplomatically. Their conclusion, as reported, marks a specific point in time, signaling either a pause, a deadlock, or perhaps, a quiet continuation behind the scenes. Understanding the Istanbul Discussions: Key Players and Reported Outcomes While the initial report from TASS via Walter Bloomberg on X was concise, the very fact that Russia Ukraine peace talks took place in Istanbul indicates a concerted effort to find common ground. Details surrounding such sensitive negotiations are often scarce, but the presence of high-level delegations suggests serious intent. Although specific outcomes were not immediately detailed in the initial reports, these discussions typically revolve around core issues central to the conflict. Key Aspects of the Istanbul Peace Talks: Aspect Details Reported / Implied Participants High-level delegations from both Russia and Ukraine. Venue Istanbul, Turkey (a neutral ground facilitated by Turkish mediation efforts). Reported Agenda (Common) Ceasefire, humanitarian corridors, security guarantees, territorial status, neutrality status. Initial Outcome Talks concluded; specific breakthroughs or failures not immediately detailed in initial reports. Source of Information Russian news agency TASS, reported by Walter Bloomberg on X. The lack of immediate, extensive public statements following the conclusion of the Russia Ukraine peace talks can be interpreted in multiple ways: either the discussions were highly sensitive and require further internal review, or they did not yield definitive public agreements at that precise moment. Nevertheless, the act of meeting itself is a significant development in the ongoing geopolitical narrative. How Russia Ukraine Peace Talks Ripple Through Global Markets The conclusion of the Russia Ukraine peace talks immediately put global financial markets on alert. Geopolitical stability is a cornerstone of economic confidence, and any perceived shift – positive or negative – can trigger significant market movements. Investors constantly weigh risk and reward, and major international conflicts introduce a layer of uncertainty that can deter investment and encourage capital flight to safer assets. Equity Markets: Stock markets often react to news of peace talks with optimism, as reduced geopolitical risk can boost corporate earnings forecasts and consumer confidence. Conversely, a perceived failure could lead to sell-offs. Commodity Prices: Energy prices (oil, natural gas) are particularly sensitive to the conflict, given Russia’s role as a major producer. Food prices are also affected due to disruptions in agricultural exports from the region. Peace talks can lead to price fluctuations as traders anticipate changes in supply.

Last week, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published an order of prohibition against Lacey Ann Henry, who was employed as a teller manager at the Trooper, Pennsylvania, branch of TD Bank from June 2020 to February 2022. The regulator says Henry accessed confidential customer information to make the unauthorized cash withdrawals from checking accounts in late 2021. Explains the OCC, “By reason of the foregoing conduct, [the] respondent engaged in violations of law and unsafe and unsound practices, which resulted in financial loss to the Bank and financial gain to [the] respondent, and demonstrated personal dishonesty.” The prohibition bars Henry from participating in the affairs of insured depository institutions, institutions treated as insured banks, insured credit unions, institutions chartered under the Farm Credit Act of 1971, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, any Federal Home Loan Bank and any relevant federal regulatory agency. Henry consented to the order but did not admit or deny the OCC’s findings. The order of prohibition does not preclude other government agencies, including the Department of Justice (DOJ), from bringing additional actions against her.

2025-07-23 18:57:07+00:00,One of the Largest Banks in the US Announces Its Move into Cryptocurrency,"PNC Bank, one of America''s leading financial institutions, is preparing to offer cryptocurrency buying, selling and custody services to its customers by collaborating with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. In a joint statement on Tuesday, it was stated that PNC will build its own crypto transaction infrastructure using Coinbase''s enterprise “crypto-as-a-service” (CaaS) platform. The Pittsburgh-based bank will allow its customers to buy, sell, and securely store Bitcoin and other digital assets. PNC will also provide certain banking services to Coinbase, further enhancing their mutual partnership. Related News: Huge Ethereum (ETH) Withdrawals Are Taking Place - CEO Reveals the Identity of the Whale Behind Them This strategic partnership between PNC and Coinbase is seen as a significant shift in the traditional banking sector''s historical distance from cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency companies have previously accused the banking sector of being “hostile” towards them. Earlier this year, allegations surfaced in Congressional hearings that banks were deliberately avoiding providing services to certain sectors. While lawmakers from both parties agreed on this, differing views were expressed on the root cause of the problem. The banking industry, however, denied these accusations, arguing that outdated and complex regulations were the reason for their inability to provide service. The announcement of the PNC-Coinbase partnership comes as US President Donald Trump''s cryptocurrency-friendly policies are gaining traction. Last week, Trump signed legislation establishing a dedicated regulatory framework for stablecoins, a long-awaited step in the industry. Other major banks, including Bank of America and Citibank, have also announced plans to launch their own stablecoins. “Our partnership with Coinbase allows us to deliver innovative crypto financial solutions to our customers faster,” PNC CEO William Demchak said in a statement. “Through this partnership, we will be able to meet the growing demand for secure and easy access to digital assets on PNC’s trusted platform.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-23 19:00:51+00:00,Analyst: Next Is $7 Once XRP Clears This Rigid Hurdle,"XRP is once again in the spotlight as analysts turn attention to a critical price level that could define its next major move. After staging a strong recovery in 2025 and recently surpassing its previous all-time high, a r ecent flash crash has sent its price to $3.20 region. According to chart analyst XRPunkie on X, the digital asset is consolidating just beneath a long-term resistance trendline, one that has historically served as a major obstacle for upward momentum. XRP Stalls Below a Key Technical Barrier The chart the analyst shared before the flash crash shows XRP trading at around $3.47, just shy of a major diagonal resistance that forms the upper boundary of an ascending channel dating back to 2017. This trendline, marked by a yellow arrow in the chart, is acting as a ceiling, similar to how the $3.50 zone capped XRP’s explosive rally during the 2017–2018 bull run. Despite multiple attempts, the price has yet to close decisively above this level, suggesting the presence of significant selling pressure. Interestingly $XRP met with some resistance at the $3.50 range for a while. Looking at this chart, apparently its hanging just below the first resistance trendline (yellow arrow). Once we clear it, the next resistance is around $7-$9 (blue arrow). Is XRP gonna to get there soon? https://t.co/chGGhwWC8X pic.twitter.com/ZyqfSADm6t — XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) July 23, 2025 What makes this area even more crucial is its psychological significance. The $3.50 level represents a long-standing benchmark in XRP’s history. Its inability to break above this range decisively during previous cycles signals that bulls must muster greater strength before a larger move can unfold. Breakout Could Ignite Rally Toward $7–$9 XRPunkie’s analysis suggests that once this resistance is cleared, the next major target lies in the $7 to $9 range . The chart highlights this zone with a blue arrow, aligned with the Fibonacci 1.272 and 1.414 extension levels, approximately $9.11 and $15.04, respectively. These Fibonacci levels are widely used by technical analysts to project potential price expansions following breakout moves. The setup implies a scenario where XRP, after breaking through the current barrier, could experience a rapid rally fueled by technical momentum and renewed market interest. Historical price action also supports this view, as similar breakouts in previous cycles have led to vertical moves.

2025-07-23 19:25:46+00:00,"Spot Ethereum ETFs saw $533.9 million in inflows, the 3rd largest single-day gain","US spot Ethereum ETFs pulled in around $533.9 million in daily inflows, the 3rd largest single‑day gain since these products began trading. The figures point to rising interest in ether from investors. Data from SoSoValue shows that BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the way with $426.2 million worth of inflows. Grayscale’s Ethereum Mini Trust added $72.6 million, while Fidelity’s ether ETF brought in $35 million. The total ranks just behind the value of $726.7 million from the previous Wednesday and the $602 million seen last Thursday. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, pointed to a drop in bitcoin dominance and steady macro conditions for support of ether’s gains. “ETH’s momentum looks set to sustain in the mid‑term as long as these factors hold,” Liu said. Nick Ruck, from LVRG Research, noted that institutions appear to be turning bullish on Ethereum. He said the record‑high inflows into spot ether ETFs offer “a second opportunity for investors who missed out on Bitcoin’s historic rise,” as part of their reserve strategies for digital assets. Companies are starting to add ether to their balance sheets under new treasury plans. For instance, SharpLink Gaming has already shifted the focus to building up its ether holdings after outlining its Eth treasury strategy earlier in May. By contrast, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw net outflows of $67.9 million on Tuesday. The previous day, investors had pulled $131.3 million from these funds, indicating a shift away from bitcoin. “We’re seeing a familiar rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum,” – Min Jung, a research analyst at Presto. “Bitcoin has rallied significantly this year, and for investors who feel they’ve ‘missed’ the BTC trade or are looking for the next opportunity, Ethereum is becoming the natural next step.” Ethereum’s recent rally comes from a surge in structural demand In a July 22 memo, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan described what he called a “demand shock” for ether. He wrote that since May 15, ETFs and corporate treasuries have bought approximately 2.83 million ETH, worth about $10 billion. That is about 32x the number of ETH minted by the network over the same period. Hougan said that over the past month alone, ether has jumped over 65%, and since April, the price has climbed over 160%. He argued that this rise is driven by the imbalance between fresh demand and new supply, rather than changing market sentiment. Since US spot BTC ETFs began trading at the start of last year, funds on Wall Street, public companies including Trump Media and Strategy, and some governments have added over 1.5 million Bitcoins to their reserves, compared with only 300,000 newly minted coins. This roughly 5 to 1 demand advantage helped push bitcoin’s price up about 155%, making it the highest performer in this time. “Five times more demand than supply. Sometimes it really is that simple,” Hougan wrote. Ethereum’s early rally run did not see strong demand In the first ten months after spot ETH ETFs launched in the mid of 2024, these funds bought just 660k coins with roughly $2.5 billion in net new money, while public companies added only small amounts, and the network issued about 543,000 ETH. As a result, ether trailed behind bitcoin’s performance over that stretch. Then, spot ETH products ramped up their purchases in mid-May. They have since bought over $5 billion worth of ether, while companies such as SharpLink Gaming, Bit Digital, BitMine Immersion, and The Ether Machine, revealed large‑scale treasury plans. These companies purchased around 2.83 million Ethereum, a move that likely helped the token break above $3,800. Looking ahead, Hougan forecasted that ETFs along with corporate treasuries may purchase $20 billion worth of Ethereum over 2025. That would be around 5.33 million tokens. At the same time, the network would only issue around 800,000 Ethereum in this time frame. He mentioned that investors remain underexposed to Ethereum in comparison with bitcoin but also expects that to change as stablecoin and tokenization trends grow. “In the short term, the price of everything is set by supply and demand, and right now, there is more demand for ETH than supply,” Hougan wrote. “As a result, I think we’re heading higher.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Currently, it ranks as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Spike In Volume And Derivatives Trading Volume trading around BNB has increased strongly. According to Coinglass data, daily volume rose over 40% to over $3 billion. Derivatives volume surged 31% to $2.18 billion, while open interest in BNB futures increased 19% to $1.23 billion. These represent an expanding tide of speculation and demand for the asset, perhaps fueled by fresh money flowing into the market. A good deal of this movement seems to be riding on bullish momentum forming around BNB’s recent price action. The token has been in an uptrend for weeks now, and this breakout above its previous highs indicates buyers are remaining bullish, even as there are indications that the market is heating up. Meanwhile, the relative strength index (RSI) is also well into overbought conditions at 87.50. When the RSI crosses above 70, it generally means that a pullback may be imminent. Nevertheless, the uptrend is still in place. BNB is well above its 20-day simple moving average of $704. Price is higher with good volume, and this is a combination that is commonly used to confirm trend strength. Nano Labs Buys $90 Million Worth Of BNB Institutional buying could be propelling the rally. On July 22, China-founded Web3 infrastructure company Nano Labs Ltd announced it had added 120,000 BNB tokens to its holdings—worth around $90 million. According to the company, it bought over-the-counter at an average cost of $707 per BNB. Nano Labs stated that it views BNB as a strategic reserve asset and will continue to add to its holdings. It also stated that it will invest in companies that are dedicated to the BNB ecosystem. Such a long-term commitment brings an element of confidence for retail investors tracking the token’s movements closely. All the hype aside, there are beginning to appear some warning signs.

2025-07-23 19:55:23+00:00,Interest Rate Cuts: Unlocking Crypto Market Potential in 2024?,"BitcoinWorld Interest Rate Cuts: Unlocking Crypto Market Potential in 2024? The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with anticipation, and few topics generate as much discussion as the potential shifts in global monetary policy. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, the whispers of impending interest rate cuts from major economies, particularly the United States, carry significant weight. Why? Because these decisions by central banks can ripple through financial markets, influencing everything from bond yields to the volatile yet exciting realm of digital assets. Understanding these macroeconomic currents is not just for economists; it is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the often-unpredictable tides of the crypto market. What Did U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Say About Interest Rate Cuts? Recently, the financial world turned its attention to a significant statement from a prominent figure: U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. According to the widely followed Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X (formerly Twitter), Bessent indicated that the U.S. could realistically anticipate ‘one or two rate cuts’ this year. This declaration, coming from such a high-ranking economic official, is far more than a casual remark; it is a powerful signal that warrants close examination by anyone invested in or considering the crypto market. Secretary Bessent’s insights are particularly relevant because he sits at the heart of U.S. economic policy. His perspective offers a glimpse into the administration’s thinking and expectations regarding the nation’s financial trajectory. When a Treasury Secretary speaks about interest rate cuts , it suggests that the underlying economic conditions—such as inflation trends, employment data, and overall economic growth—are being carefully evaluated, potentially paving the way for a shift in the Federal Reserve’s monetary stance. While the Federal Reserve operates independently, high-level government officials often have access to comprehensive economic data and forecasts that inform their public statements, making Bessent’s comments a key piece of the puzzle for market watchers. Why Do Interest Rate Cuts Matter for the Crypto Market? Understanding the intricate dance between traditional monetary policy and the decentralized world of cryptocurrency is crucial for any investor. Historically, there is an inverse relationship often observed: when interest rate cuts are on the horizon or enacted, riskier assets, including cryptocurrencies, tend to become more attractive. But what exactly drives this dynamic? Let’s break down the core mechanisms: Lower Borrowing Costs: When central banks reduce interest rates, the cost of borrowing money for businesses and consumers decreases. This encourages spending and investment, as capital becomes cheaper to acquire. More money flowing through the economy often finds its way into various asset classes, including those perceived as having higher growth potential. Increased Liquidity: Reduced interest rates typically lead to an expansion of the money supply and increased liquidity in the financial system. This abundance of capital seeks returns, and with lower yields on traditional ‘safe’ investments like savings accounts or government bonds, investors are often pushed towards assets that promise higher growth, even if they come with greater risk. Reduced Opportunity Cost: The opportunity cost of holding riskier assets like cryptocurrencies decreases when interest rates are low. If you can earn minimal returns from a bank savings account or a low-yield bond, the allure of potentially significant gains from crypto becomes stronger, making the trade-off more appealing for investors seeking better returns. Valuation of Growth Assets: Many crypto projects, particularly those focused on innovation and future technologies, are considered ‘growth assets.’ In a lower interest rate environment, the present value of future earnings or potential growth for these assets tends to increase. This is because the discount rate used to value future cash flows or potential market share is lower, making their long-term prospects appear more valuable today. These factors collectively create an environment where the perceived risk-reward balance shifts in favor of growth-oriented and volatile assets, making the prospect of interest rate cuts a generally bullish signal for the cryptocurrency market. Navigating the Economic Landscape: What are the Broader Implications of Rate Cuts? While the direct impact on crypto is a major focus for our community, it is vital to zoom out and consider the broader economic implications of interest rate cuts . These decisions are not made in a vacuum; they reflect central banks’ assessment of economic health and their strategies to achieve stability and growth. A rate cut typically signals a desire to stimulate economic activity, combat potential slowdowns, or manage disinflationary pressures.

2025-07-23 19:55:49+00:00,Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Calls for ‘Internal Review’ of Federal Reserve As Pressure on Jerome Powell Mounts,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is calling for a review of the central bank’s operations as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces mounting pressure to resign. In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Bessent says that the Federal Reserve is in need of deeper scrutiny as its budget and operations have expanded over the years. Bessent’s comments come as President Donald Trump has said he hopes Powell quits and has also considered attempting to remove him, all while slamming the Fed chair for not cutting interest rates. “The President has said he is not going to fire Chair Powell. I was somewhat surprised that [economist] Mohamed El-Erian came out and said that [Powell should resign]. And what I’ve come out and said is that I believe that it would do Chair Powell a favor, and he would be doing the institution a favor, if he did an internal review, separate monetary policy from everything else. And this is something that [economist and former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury] Larry Summers and I agree on, is this mission creep from the Fed is endangering their independence of monetary policy, all these other things that they’re engaging in could threaten monetary policy. It is a big, sprawling institution.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is calling for a review of the central bank’s operations as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces mounting pressure to resign. In a new interview with Bloomberg Television, Bessent says that the Federal Reserve is in need of deeper scrutiny as its budget and operations have expanded over the years. Bessent’s comments come as President Donald Trump has said he hopes Powell quits and has also considered attempting to remove him, all while slamming the Fed chair for not cutting interest rates. “The President has said he is not going to fire Chair Powell. I was somewhat surprised that [economist] Mohamed El-Erian came out and said that [Powell should resign]. And what I’ve come out and said is that I believe that it would do Chair Powell a favor, and he would be doing the institution a favor, if he did an internal review, separate monetary policy from everything else. And this is something that [economist and former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury] Larry Summers and I agree on, is this mission creep from the Fed is endangering their independence of monetary policy, all these other things that they’re engaging in could threaten monetary policy. It is a big, sprawling institution. The central budget for the board is up 4x since 2004, and every institution needs to examine themselves.” Bessent also says he’d support Powell overseeing the agency’s review, despite the criticism he’s facing. “It could be a committee.

The OCC says it’s issuing an order of prohibition against Cricel Santamaria, a former client service representative at Webster Bank in Stamford, Connecticut. Says the OCC, “From approximately April 2019 until May 23, 2022, the respondent was employed at the bank. Between approximately October 2021 and April 2022, the respondent obtained approximately 62 check images from the bank’s internal systems and made them available for sale over the internet. Thirteen bank customers reported fraud on their accounts shortly after their checks were made available for sale on the internet. The total fraud reported was $237,374 and the total Bank loss was approximately $108,000.” According to the OCC, Santamaria “engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, caused more than a minimal loss to the bank, demonstrated personal dishonesty and willful or continuing disregard for the safety and soundness of the bank.” The OCC order prohibits the ex-banker from working in the banking and financial services industry. Santamaria consents to the OCC order without admitting or denying any wrongdoing. Under the order, the Department of Justice (DOJ) retains its right to “bring other actions deemed appropriate” against Santamaria.

A Statement That Crossed the Line? The comment marks one of the more extreme examples of tribalism within the crypto space.

A Deeper Divide: Bitcoin Maximalists vs. XRP Supporters The controversy underscores a broader, long-standing conflict between Bitcoin maximalists, who believe Bitcoin is the only legitimate cryptocurrency, and supporters of projects like XRP, which offer faster, more energy-efficient solutions tailored for cross-border payments. Bitcoin has come under increasing scrutiny for its high energy consumption and scalability issues, while XRP’s value proposition lies in its speed, negligible transaction costs, and eco-friendly infrastructure. This has led to more institutional support for XRP, fueling resentment in corners of the Bitcoin community where decentralization purity tests remain the standard. XRP’s Meteoric Rise Adds Fuel to the Fire Since the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, XRP has surged by over 600%, bolstered by Ripple’s legal victories, the expansion of the XRP Ledger ecosystem, and increased adoption in financial corridors across Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.

2025-07-23 20:00:41+00:00,Ripple Won’t Dump Its XRP Escrow Holdings: Lawyer Reveals Why It’s Actually Good For Price,"Legal expert Bill Morgan has commented on accusations that Ripple would dump its XRP escrow holdings at some point. He explained why that won’t happen and noted how the escrow strategy is good for the altcoin’s price. Ripple’s Escrow Will Buttress XRP Price Not Deflate It In an X post , Bill Morgan noted that even the SEC recognized that Ripple’s escrow was intended to buttress the XRP price and not deflate it. He added that even the Commission considered this to be one of the factors that would give investors an expectation of profit from the crypto firm’s efforts. The legal then remarked that this is just one of the points that clearly debunks the ‘dump theory’ around Ripple’s escrow . His response was in reply to a crypto community member who criticized XRP holders who think that the escrow is good for their holdings. He then indicated that the crypto firm would at some point dump its holdings on these investors. Meanwhile, Bill Morgan had earlier noted how there hasn’t been a stark difference between Ripple’s escrowed funds in 2017 and now. He revealed that the crypto firm had 55 billion XRP in escrow in late 2017 while it now has 35 billion in escrow. Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP monthly. As such, these escrowed funds should have reduced drastically since 2017. However, Ripple typically relocks a significant portion of these coins following the monthly unlocks, which explains why the crypto firm’s holdings haven’t flooded the market. Notably, the firm uses these coins for its on-demand liquidity (ODL) services. As such, the coins that are left unlocked are in demand, which also provides a boost for the XRP price. Ripple is also looking to expand its operations, which could further boost the altcoin’s adoption. Reason For the Escrow ‘Dump Theory’ In response to the accusations against Ripple, Bill Morgan suggested that many of these crypto community members have been simply sidelined on the recent XRP price rally . As such, he believes this is why they are trying to spread Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD). In an X post , he asked a particular critic if they missed out on XRP when it was still trading at $0.20. Indeed, the XRP price had traded around this level in 2023 and remained stuck in the $0.50 range for most of 2024 before finally taking off in the last quarter of the year, recording a rally of over 500%. The altcoin has continued this run this year and last week rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) of $3.65. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.50, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-wont-dump-its-xrp-escrow/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY,Ripple|Altcoin|and Doubt|Bill Morgan|Coinmarketcap|escrow|fear|fud|ODL|On-Demand Liquidity|ripple|ripple news|Uncertainty|US SEC|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,BTC,"Ripple Won’t Dump Its XRP Escrow Holdings: Lawyer Reveals Why It’s Actually Good For Price.

2025-07-23 20:05:07+00:00,Renowned Analyst Claims: “The Altcoin Season Has Begun” – Here Are His Opinions,"Cryptocurrency analyst Miles Deutscher claimed that the altcoin season has begun, based on data from an artificial intelligence model and a custom dashboard. In his YouTube video, Deutscher noted that, contrary to the popular altcoin season index, the current market situation signals a positive period for altcoins. According to the analyst, approximately 70% of the top 50 altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin on a monthly basis. Deutscher suggested that Bitcoin''s dominance falling below a key support level for the first time since November 2024 has led to a shift in market momentum.

Cryptocurrency analyst Miles Deutscher claimed that the altcoin season has begun, based on data from an artificial intelligence model and a custom dashboard. In his YouTube video, Deutscher noted that, contrary to the popular altcoin season index, the current market situation signals a positive period for altcoins. According to the analyst, approximately 70% of the top 50 altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin on a monthly basis. Deutscher suggested that Bitcoin''s dominance falling below a key support level for the first time since November 2024 has led to a shift in market momentum. He noted that the primary driver behind this shift is growing positive sentiment toward Ethereum. He argued that ETH ETFs, new regulatory frameworks, and institutional interest are boosting Ethereum, providing the necessary “firepower” for a broader altcoin market rally.

Some suggested this may be a drive to take profits, but there may be another reason, as more old whales are dusted with transactions containing warning messages. There may be one common reason as to why old whales are moving their coins. After years of holding, some of the largest holders transferred their coins. The most notable case was of one user moving 80,000 BTC from several wallets. The reason may be hiding behind the spread of messages, which are considered a specific scam using the op return function of Bitcoin transactions. Investigators, however, noted that many old whale wallets received dust amounts of BTC with a pseudo-legal message attached to the transaction. The targeted addresses were not specifically chosen, except by one common thread – a high balance and old wallets from the early years of the network. Dust messages reach BTC lost in landfill One on-chain investigator noted the pseudo-legal messages reached a notorious BTC wallet. The stash belonged to James Howells, known for trashing a hard drive containing 8,000 BTC. Since the address is widely known and the coins are considered lost, the legal claim to the BTC in Howell’s wallet is meaningless.

Unfortunately, even a legal claim would not be able to salvage Howells’ coins. The wallet has been pelted with messages and even an ultimatum to prove that the coins are not forfeited.

2025-07-23 20:29:50+00:00,Bitwise’s 10 Crypto ETF Approved but Stayed in Bizarre Move,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the conversion of Bitwise’s cryptocurrency index fund. However, the agency later issued a stay order halting the launch pending further internal review. Regulator Issues Second Reversal This Month A July 22 filing shows that the SEC had granted an “accelerated approval” for Bitwise’s proposal to convert its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). In what Bloomberg ETF analyst Nate Geraci referred to as a “bizarre situation,” the regulator then later put the action on hold. “This letter is to notify you that, pursuant to Rule 431 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.431, the Commission will review the delegated action,” read the document. Notably, it marks the second time this month that the financial watchdog has intervened to block such a request. The SEC also stopped the launch of Grayscale’s mixed crypto ETF. That product had received initial approval from the Division of Trading and Markets, but was later stayed by the Commission under the same provisions. These back-to-back reversals have gotten criticism from analysts. In a Tuesday X post, Geraci insisted , “Both of these should be allowed to convert/uplist ASAP.” The ETF was set to trade on NYSE Arca as a “Trust Unit” and includes a mix of top cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), SUI, Avalanche (AVAX), Polkadot (DOT), and Litecoin (LTC). However, until the order is lifted, BITW shares will remain available only over-the-counter. Under Rule 431, the SEC can independently review any decision its staff makes under delegated authority. Once invoked, the regulator automatically suspends the decision until it determines whether to uphold, amend, or reverse it. Further, there isn’t a required timeline for this process. Bitwise currently manages approximately $5.79 billion in assets across its 12 crypto ETFs. The firm’s largest product is its spot Bitcoin ETF, which accounts for roughly $4.79 billion in AUM, while its Ethereum product holds an additional $431 million. Experts Weigh In Scott Johnsson, general partner at Van Buren Capital, and Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart shared their views on X regarding the SEC’s decision to stop these investment products from going live. Johnsson suggested that the agency may have approved the conversion with the knowledge that Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who has been critical of crypto, would later intervene, or that the timing was aligned with the deadlines of both proposals. “Both explanations are the kind of funny business that shouldn’t really be happening under Atkins,” he wrote.

For some, the XRP Army’s passion favors a bullish XRP price prediction . In a conversation with the crypto-focused magazine Decrypt, a handful of members of the so-called XRP Army shared their thoughts about the current state of the token and the journey they have all gone through. “Seven years of waiting for progress because [of] stupid left-wing politics in our way through the SEC. Do you understand?” commented MackAttackXRP, a prominent XRP fan whose X account is followed by more than 87,000 users. Meanwhile, another fan called John Squire said: “The anger in the XRP community is mostly directed at the SEC, for artificially holding back the asset with a lawsuit that hurt retail investors the most.” Don’t celebrate anything until $XRP hits $1000, we wouldn’t want anyone getting upset. — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) July 23, 2025 Now that a new pro-crypto administration has taken over and a new Chairman has been appointed to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), members of the XRP Army members believe that the token will play catch up to deliver the significant gains that other assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) have during this 7-year period. XRP Price Prediction: XRP Could Retreat a Bit Before Its Next Big Move Looking at XRP’s 4-hour chart, we can see that the latest rally has hit a ceiling once it got to $3.65. Selling pressure has been high at that point as early buyers probably started to take some profits off the table. The 9-day exponential moving average (EMA) seems poised to make a bearish crossover below the 21-day EMA, which favors a near-term correction. Any declines at this point may be considered a great opportunity to buy XRP at a lower price as the token’s long-term prospects are as promising as ever. Can XRP hit $20? It is definitely a possibility but not an easy feat. It would mean that the asset’s market value will rise to $1 trillion – still not as valuable as Bitcoin but it would involve flipping Ethereum (ETH). In the meantime, the best crypto presales like Token6900 (T6900) offer significant upside potential in the short term as investors look for the most promising projects whose value could 10x in the next few months. Token6900 (T6900) is The Purest Meme Coin Out There – Here’s Why Token6900 (T6900) leverages the success of SPX6900 (SPX) but adds a touch of 2000s nostalgia to the mix. This token is a meme coin in its purest form – no road map, no use case, no promises. It is everything that Wall Street isn’t. T6900 is hard capped at $5 million, meaning that early buyers will be the ones to profit the most from its surge. Since its presale event kicked off a few weeks ago, it has already raised more than $1 million to follow the footsteps of its predecessor.

2025-07-23 20:58:08+00:00,Sleeping Bitcoins Are Waking Up and Entering Circulation: What Does This Mean? What Can We Expect?,"In his latest analysis of Bitcoin''s supply dynamics, cryptocurrency analyst Axel Adler noted that the market is still in the early stages of the macrocycle. According to Adler, the return of Bitcoins, which have been dormant for a long time, to circulation provides striking signals on the supply side, but the majority of investors are not in a rush to sell. Adler recalled two significant increases in supply volatility in past macrocycles: First, when Bitcoin rose to $70,000 in the spring of 2024, the percentage of coins activated within 180 days reached 20%. The second increase reached 18% in December 2024, when Bitcoin first surpassed the psychological threshold of $100,000. These movements indicated that long-dormant assets, known as “sleeper coins,” were being mobilized and redistributed into the market. Adler noted that supply activity began to rise again after Bitcoin reached $100,000 again in June 2025, noting that this rate has shifted from negative territory to positive by 2.4% in the last 30 days. However, the fact that this increase is lower than past peaks suggests that there is still a significant “bullish buffer” in the market and that supply pressure remains limited, according to Adler. Related News: Watch Out: Jim Cramer Spoke About Bitcoin and Ethereum! Will it be Inverse Cramer Again? Adler made the following assessment in his statement: Essentially, a significant portion of investors are not yet ready to sell. Supply only began to revive at the start of the new rally. As the price consolidates above $120,000, the 30-day active supply ratio will first rise to the 8-10% range, then rise again to 18-20%. Once these levels are reached, the final distribution phase will begin. *This is not investment advice.

These movements indicated that long-dormant assets, known as “sleeper coins,” were being mobilized and redistributed into the market. Adler noted that supply activity began to rise again after Bitcoin reached $100,000 again in June 2025, noting that this rate has shifted from negative territory to positive by 2.4% in the last 30 days. However, the fact that this increase is lower than past peaks suggests that there is still a significant “bullish buffer” in the market and that supply pressure remains limited, according to Adler.

Adler made the following assessment in his statement: Essentially, a significant portion of investors are not yet ready to sell. Supply only began to revive at the start of the new rally. As the price consolidates above $120,000, the 30-day active supply ratio will first rise to the 8-10% range, then rise again to 18-20%. Once these levels are reached, the final distribution phase will begin. *This is not investment advice.

As The Kobeissi Letter summed up in a widely shared post: “Rate cuts are coming … Next week’s Fed meeting will pave the path for a September rate cut.” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has broken with predecessors’ reticence by all but instructing the central bank to move sooner. “If [tariff] inflation isn’t sticky, they could do it sooner than September,” he told Fox News on 1 July, after stating two months earlier that “the bond market is sending a signal that the Fed should be cutting.” Only hours after the Fed decision, Bessent will unveil the Treasury’s third‑quarter borrowing plans at the Quarterly Refunding Announcement. The agenda published on 11 July flags a noon release on 30 July. Desks are watching not just the size but the maturity mix: Bessent’s advisers have floated heavier use of short‑dated bills to “manage the yield curve,” a move that would soak up the very cash that cycles into stablecoins and crypto risk.

A 7 July executive order extended reciprocal tariffs and launched a volley of tariff‑rate letters to trading partners; the new levies take effect on 1 August unless renegotiated.

2025-07-23 21:30:53+00:00,FTX Creditor Distribution: A Crucial August 15 Deadline Approaches,"BitcoinWorld FTX Creditor Distribution: A Crucial August 15 Deadline Approaches The crypto world has been buzzing with anticipation, and for good reason. For thousands of individuals and institutions impacted by the devastating collapse of FTX, a significant milestone is on the horizon. The FTX Recovery Trust, the dedicated entity managing the remnants of the once-mighty crypto exchange, has officially designated August 15 as the record date for its next substantial FTX creditor distribution . This news, initially reported by Unfolded on X, marks a pivotal moment in the long and arduous journey toward recompense for those who lost their assets. Understanding the Catastrophe: The Fall of FTX To truly grasp the importance of this upcoming FTX creditor distribution , it’s essential to revisit the events that led us here. FTX, once a titan in the cryptocurrency exchange landscape, collapsed spectacularly in November 2022. What began as liquidity concerns quickly spiraled into a full-blown bankruptcy, revealing a staggering mismanagement of customer funds, alleged fraud, and a complex web of financial irregularities. The fallout was immediate and far-reaching, impacting millions of users globally and sending shockwaves through the entire crypto market. The collapse wasn’t just a financial disaster; it was a profound breach of trust. Users who had placed their faith and their digital assets with FTX found themselves in an unprecedented situation, with their funds frozen and their financial futures uncertain. The subsequent legal proceedings, investigations, and the appointment of new leadership to oversee the bankruptcy process have been complex and drawn-out. The FTX Recovery Trust: Pioneering the Path to Repayment In the wake of the collapse, the primary objective became clear: recover as much as possible for the defrauded creditors. This monumental task fell largely to the FTX Recovery Trust. This entity has been diligently working to: Identify and Secure Assets: Tracing and securing various assets, including cryptocurrencies, real estate, and other investments, often hidden or commingled. Navigate Legal Complexities: Engaging in numerous legal battles, negotiations, and settlements to maximize the recovery pool. Establish a Fair Distribution Framework: Developing a transparent and equitable process for distributing recovered funds to a vast number of creditors with diverse claims. The establishment of August 15 as a record date signifies a critical step forward in this intricate process, indicating that the Trust has made sufficient progress to begin another round of repayments. What Exactly is a ‘Record Date’ and Why Does it Matter for FTX Creditor Distribution? For many, the term ‘record date’ might seem like legal jargon. However, in the context of bankruptcy and creditor distributions, it holds immense significance. The record date, in this case August 15, is the specific cutoff date used to determine which creditors are eligible to receive the upcoming distribution. Here’s a breakdown of its importance: Eligibility Confirmation: Only creditors whose claims are recognized and recorded by this date will be included in the current distribution round. Snapshot of Claims: It provides a definitive snapshot of the creditor base at a particular point in time, streamlining the administrative process for payment. Prevents Future Complications: It helps to manage changes in creditor ownership or claim status that might occur after the date, ensuring a clear and organized payout. Creditors should ensure their claim information is accurate and up-to-date with the FTX Recovery Trust well before this date to avoid any delays or issues with receiving their entitled share of the FTX creditor distribution . The Long Road Traveled: Previous Recovery Efforts and Remaining Challenges The journey to this point has been anything but smooth. Since the initial bankruptcy filing, the FTX estate has made considerable strides in asset recovery. Reports indicate billions of dollars in assets have been identified and secured, far exceeding initial pessimistic forecasts. This success is largely due to the diligent work of the new management team and legal experts. However, significant challenges persist: Valuation Volatility: A substantial portion of recovered assets are cryptocurrencies, whose values can fluctuate wildly, impacting the final payout amounts. Legal Disputes: Ongoing legal battles with various parties, including former FTX executives and other entities, continue to tie up funds and resources. Administrative Hurdles: Managing and verifying claims from millions of creditors worldwide is an enormous logistical undertaking. Despite these hurdles, the setting of the August 15 record date is a strong indicator of the Trust’s confidence in its ability to proceed with further distributions, offering a glimmer of hope to those who have waited patiently.

2025-07-23 21:40:23+00:00,Crypto Futures Liquidation: A Shocking $727 Million Wiped Out in 24 Hours,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: A Shocking $727 Million Wiped Out in 24 Hours The cryptocurrency market is a place of rapid highs and sudden lows, where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye. Recently, the crypto world witnessed a stark reminder of this volatility, as a staggering $126 million worth of crypto futures were liquidated in just one hour , pushing the total liquidations over the past 24 hours to a shocking $727 million . This massive crypto futures liquidation event sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, leaving many traders stunned and prompting crucial questions about market stability and risk management. For anyone involved in or considering entering the crypto space, understanding the mechanics and implications of such events, particularly crypto futures liquidation , is paramount. What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation? To grasp the magnitude of recent events, it’s essential to understand what crypto futures liquidation entails. In simple terms, it’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to a lack of sufficient margin to cover potential losses. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. They often involve leverage, meaning you can trade with more capital than you actually possess, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Here’s a breakdown of the core components: Leverage: This is a double-edged sword. It allows traders to open larger positions with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, with 10x leverage, a $100 investment can control a $1,000 position. Margin: This is the collateral (your actual funds) deposited with the exchange to cover potential losses. It acts as a buffer. Margin Call: If the market moves against a leveraged position, the value of the collateral decreases. If it falls below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange issues a margin call, requesting additional funds. Forced Closure (Liquidation): If the trader fails to add more funds to meet the margin requirements, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. This is the crypto futures liquidation . The recent figures highlight just how quickly and forcefully these mechanisms can kick in, leading to significant capital evaporation for those caught on the wrong side of the market. Analyzing the Shocking Numbers: Who Was Hit Hardest by Crypto Futures Liquidation? The reported $727 million in crypto futures liquidation over 24 hours, with a concentrated $126 million within a single hour, indicates a sharp market movement that caught many leveraged traders off guard. While specific breakdowns by exchange and asset can vary, such large-scale liquidations typically occur during periods of extreme price volatility, often triggered by significant news, macroeconomic shifts, or large institutional trades. Historically, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures tend to account for the largest share of liquidations due to their high trading volumes and open interest. However, altcoins can also experience disproportionately large liquidations if they undergo sudden, steep price corrections. Consider the typical breakdown during such events (hypothetical representation based on common market behavior): Asset 24H Liquidations (Approx.) Primary Direction (Long/Short) Bitcoin (BTC) $350 million Long Ethereum (ETH) $200 million Long Solana (SOL) $50 million Long Other Altcoins $127 million Mixed This table illustrates how a significant downturn can disproportionately impact ‘long’ positions (bets that the price will go up), leading to widespread crypto futures liquidation as prices fall. What Triggers These Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Events? Large-scale crypto futures liquidation events are rarely isolated incidents. They are typically the culmination of several factors converging to create a perfect storm in the market. Understanding these triggers is crucial for predicting and potentially avoiding being caught in such a squeeze. Key triggers include: Sudden Price Drops: The most common catalyst. A sharp, unexpected decline in the price of a major cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) can rapidly push many leveraged long positions below their liquidation thresholds. High Leverage Ratios: When traders use extremely high leverage (e.g., 50x or 100x), even minor price fluctuations can lead to a margin call or immediate liquidation. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to wipe out a position. Cascading Liquidations: This is a vicious cycle. As initial liquidations occur, the forced selling by exchanges adds further selling pressure to the market, driving prices down even more. This, in turn, triggers more liquidations, creating a domino effect that can accelerate a market downturn.

2025-07-23 21:45:22+00:00,"Arkham clarified that the U.S. government still holds at least 198,000 BTC across multiple agencies","Arkham has cleared up the confusion around the U.S. government’s cryptocurrency holdings after alarm spread throughout the cryptocurrency community following the release of public records from the U.S. Marshals Service. The blockchain data tracking firm, Arkham Intelligence, has compiled data showing the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings across several agencies to clarify the confusion around the rumors that the U.S. government had depleted its Bitcoin reserves. The U.S. government still holds over 198,000 BTC, Arkham says Public records released by the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) sparked a wave of confusion and alarm over the size of the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings. The document, obtained via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request and dated July 15, states that the USMS currently holds 28,988.356 BTC, valued at approximately $3.44B. However, the blockchain intelligence firm, Arkham, has clarified that the U.S. government still holds at least 198,000 BTC, worth roughly $23.5B, across multiple agencies and wallets. The company also asserted that none of the funds have moved in the past four months. U.S. government crypto holdings. Source: Arkham Intelligence U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis responded on X to the initial claim of dwindling reserves with concern. “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves—leaving just ~29,000 coins. If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race,” she wrote .

If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race. https://t.co/ciYf1uhy0x — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) July 16, 2025 But according to Arkham, the FOIA request only accounted for holdings by the US Marshals Service, which traditionally manages seized assets and conducts public auctions. Other agencies like the FBI, IRS, DEA, and Department of Justice also seize Bitcoin but do not regularly disclose their crypto balances, making centralized tracking nearly impossible. Arkham has identified at least 198,012 BTC under government control, spread across several high-profile criminal cases. The largest share of the reserve, totaling 114,599 BTC, which is worth about $13.65B was seized from Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, or “Razzlekhan,” in connection with the 2016 Bitfinex hack. Another major holding includes 94,643 BTC seized in two separate Silk Road-related cases. 51,680 BTC from James Zhong, who stole funds from the Silk Road marketplace, and 69,370 BTC previously seized from ‘Individual X,’ believed to have hacked Silk Road. Additional seizures include $81.25M in BTC from Alameda Research’s Binance accounts after the FTX collapse and $79.49M in BTC from HashFlare scammers Sergei Potapenko and Ivan Turogin. Comprehensive data is limited The FOIA request, which was filed by independent journalist, “L0la L33tz” specifically asked the USMS for “the amount of Bitcoin held by the U.S. Marshals Service.” In return, she received a detailed spreadsheet , case breakdowns, and a total of 28,988.35643016 BTC as of July 15, 2025. The letter, sent by the Office of General Counsel, confirmed the data came from the Asset Forfeiture Division, though some lines were redacted for legal reasons. The ensuing controversy shows that the lack of a centralized database for all U.S. government BTC holdings is a critical barrier to transparency. For years, analysts have estimated the total government stash to hover around 200,000 BTC, but this number has been difficult to verify given the involvement of multiple law enforcement and regulatory bodies with differing reporting practices. L33tz has already filed a second FOIA request to determine whether the government’s holdings are being managed through Coinbase Prime, a platform often used to liquidate seized assets. Arkham’s data supports that Coinbase has been the venue for recent U.S. government BTC sales, including the sale of 9,861 BTC from James Zhong in March of 2023, totaling about $215M. In August 2024, the U.S. government sold 10,000 BTC from James Zhong, which is equivalent to $593.9M. Another 10,000 BTC, approximately $968.6M from James Zhong, was sold in December of 2024. 58.7 BTC from Ryan Farace was sold in July 2024. Despite these sales, Arkham insists that the U.S. government retains significant Bitcoin reserves. For instance, the Bitfinex and Silk Road cases alone account for over 150,000 BTC.

What was once the domain of early adopters and tech-savvy investors is now being embraced by corporate giants, who consider the crypto king the virtual version of Gold. A Shift In Bitcoin Toward A Gold-Like Stability Over the years, Bitcoin has witnessed significant growth in terms of price and on-chain activity, prompting many to compare the digital asset to Gold, the largest asset in the world. Anthony Scaramucci, the founder and Managing Partner of SkyBridge Capital, recently weighed in on the growing discussion, offering his insights on the evolution of BTC. In an interview on Bloomberg, Anthony Scaramucci explained that Bitcoin is in an evolutionary phase as major publicly traded companies take significant steps to acquire the top cryptocurrency. According to the founder, BTC is experiencing a pivotal transition, moving from its initial status as a speculative tech asset to its growing recognition as digital gold. The founder’s remark highlights the current state of Bitcoin in the financial landscape, where institutional investors, wealth managers, and sovereign funds are adopting the asset to address inflation, currency debasement, and geopolitical instability. While addressing how BTC could fully claim the digital gold status, Scaramucci stated that wallet expansion is the main factor that would solidify this notion. Currently, the Bitcoin network boasts roughly 300 million wallet addresses , but the founder believes that the number could expand over time. However, with 1 billion wallet addresses, BTC’s volatile nature is expected to decrease sharply, drawing attention to notable assets like Microsoft and Google over the years. Such a scenario for the crypto king is likely to cement its position as a reliable store of value and a hedge against inflation. As a result, BTC will attract more retailers, institutional investors, and long-term holders , which will persistently dampen volatility over time. Is BTC An Asset Class Or An Investment? In the interview, the founder also made a bold prediction on Bitcoin’s market cap , which is expected to rise to unprecedented levels as its user base and holders grow. Scaramucci believes that Bitcoin market cap might experience a massive pump, possibly matching that of Gold. Big institutions and high-net-worth players may be steadily acquiring BTC, thereby bolstering its market value. However, Scaramucci contends that Bitcoin’s market cap growth will likely be determined by whether it is seen as an investment or an asset class. If considered an investment, the founder has called a $1 trillion to $3 trillion value an ideal market cap for BTC.

Investors are beginning to divert their funds from Bitcoin, turning their attention to several promising altcoins. This shift indicates potential growth opportunities for these lesser-known digital currencies.

Ethereum Sees Strong Price Movement Amid Key Resistance Levels Ethereum showed strong performance with a 68.57% rise over the past month and a steady 12.45% gain over the past six months. A notable one-week increase of 19.60% highlights short-term strength. Price action during these periods demonstrated rapid upward moves, drawing attention from traders who watched the coin’s impressive short-term surge against a more moderate longer-term climb. Current trading ranges show Ethereum moving between approximately $2110 and $2870. Immediate resistance is present at $3254, while solid support rests at $1735, with an additional resistance barrier near $4014 and lower support around $975. The high relative strength index of 86.22 suggests that the coin is overbought, yet moving averages lean positive. Bulls appear active within the current range, but caution is warranted given the mixed signals. Traders might consider buying near support and planning exits at resistance levels, ensuring stops are set slightly below key supports to protect positions. Upbeat Momentum as Solana Eyes Bullish Moves Recent SOL performance shows a strong rebound over the past month with a 53.28% increase, while the half-year figures reveal a 20.23% decline. Price swings have been evident, ranging from lows at $131 to highs around $173. This period has seen significant short-term strength offset by a longer-term downturn, marking a period of adjustment. The one-week surge of 23.10% highlights renewed interest, while the longer timeline reminds traders of underlying volatility and sensitivity to market shifts. Current trading levels are defined by a support near $107.89 and resistance at $191.79, with an extended resistance at $233.74 and a second support at $65.94. The price remains within a confined range where bulls are trying to exert control, hinting at cautious optimism among traders. Momentum and oscillators display mixed signals with a high RSI of 77.64, suggesting short-term overbought conditions despite upward movement. Prices near $173 suggest a testing of resistance, and trading within these key levels can offer opportunities if buyers sustain pressure in a rally. XRP Price Surge and Key Trading Zones During the last month, XRP surged 73.58% with a weekly gain of 19.98%, while over the past six months the coin posted a more modest increase of 12.34%. These figures highlight a rapid climb in the short term, contrasting with steadier growth in the medium term. Recent momentum suggests an active trading environment fueled by investor optimism, indicating a response to market fluctuations. Currently, XRP trades between $1.99 and $2.41, with resistance at $2.59 and a tougher barrier at $3.02. Immediate support appears at $1.73, with a deeper floor at $1.30. Technical indicators show an Awesome Oscillator reading of 0.91 and a Momentum Indicator at 0.67, reinforcing the recent upward movement. A Relative Strength Index of 81.47 indicates potential overbought conditions. Traders may seek to buy from $1.73 towards $2.59 or short near resistance, as the market leans bullish with consolidation and breakout opportunities ahead. Conclusion The shift in capital marks a significant trend in the market. ETH , SOL , and XRP are attracting more attention and investment. This movement highlights the growing interest in these coins. Investors seem to believe in their potential for future growth. As Bitcoin settles, these alternatives become more appealing.

2025-07-23 22:21:46+00:00,Another One: Japan’s Kitabo Turns to Bitcoin for Treasury Reserves,"The manufacturing firm has turned to the asset, adopting the treasury model, citing steep financial losses. It has joined the rising list of Japanese companies adopting this strategy, contributing to the billions of dollars already invested in bitcoin within the country. Changing Strategies Kitabo Co., Ltd, a company that engages in the production and sale of synthetic fiber spun yarns listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, announced on Tuesday that it will start accumulating Bitcoin via dollar-cost averaging (DCA). The plan is to purchase ¥800 million ($5.4 million) worth of BTC to stabilize the firm after years of losses and minimal cash flow. The team further noted that “this marks the company’s full-scale entry into the cryptocurrency and real-world asset business.” Kitabo has now joined the ranks of Asian peers that employ the Bitcoin treasury strategy, given its increasing use as a hedge against currency devaluation. The company has been struggling with annual net losses, hemorrhaging ¥115.6 million ($785,000), in fiscal 2024, but hopes to turn the tide around with the treasury implementation. It plans to acquire Bitcoin through local exchanges using funds it raised from its fourth Series of Stock Acquisition Rights. Additionally, it will use the cryptocurrency for cross-border services and partnerships with overseas businesses. Kitabo Co. also intends to generate a yield on its Bitcoin holdings by lending some of what it has accumulated to lending companies in exchange for returns. Not a First for Japan The yarn producer is not the first business in Japan to implement the initially coined “Strategy strategy.” Perhaps the most prominent example is Metaplanet, which transitioned from a hotel business to a Bitcoin treasury entity, currently holding 16,352 BTC, valued at $1.93B at the time of printing, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries. They are currently ranked 7th on the site, trailing Trump Media & Technology Group’s stash of 18,430 Bitcoin and well above Galaxy Digital Holdings’ 12,830 pile, with premiums of $2.18 billion and $1.52 billion, respectively. Video game giant Nexon also turned to the top asset a while back, and they even accept it as a form of payment. They currently hold 1,717 BTC with a current price of $203.21 million.

2025-07-23 22:30:00+00:00,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 23 July – XRP, Cardano, Pepe","Bitcoin has spurred a crypto revival after surging to an unprecedented price peak of $122,838 on the previous week’s Monday. This milestone has reinforced bullish sentiments among traders, placing Bitcoin just 3.8% shy of its previous all-time high (ATH) as it eyes another potential breakout. This dramatic rise has spurred strong gains across leading altcoins and top meme coins , with XRP, TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin each recording new historic highs, bolstering market optimism for sustained growth. However, with crypto’s overall market capitalization sitting at $4 trillion, a period of cooling off has begun to stabilize gains, as reflected by a 3.7% dip over the past 24 hours. As speculation mounts around a major upcoming bull run, investors are strategically targeting digital assets they expect to breach previous price ceilings. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Crypto Notches Record Price Highs Ripple’s XRP continues to cement its role as a bridge between legacy banking systems and blockchain-based transactions. On July 18, it set a new ATH of $3.65, breaking its prior 2018 record of $3.40 – its first new high in seven years. Currently trading at $3.45, XRP has now slipped from its ATH by 5.3%, though bullish traders anticipate a run to a new peak. Due to its swift global settlement capabilities and ultra-low transaction fees, XRP has secured robust institutional backing, even earning praise from the United Nations for allowing frictionless cross-border payments without conventional banking intermediaries. After years of legal contention, Ripple achieved a decisive victory in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that retail sales of XRP do not constitute securities transactions. The SEC formally dropped its case by 2025, eliminating regulatory uncertainty and reinforcing XRP’s position among leading cryptocurrencies. This legal clarity sparked renewed investor enthusiasm, sending XRP soaring over 474% since this time last year – far outpacing Bitcoin’s 76% growth in the same timeframe. XRP’s relative strength index (RSI) currently stands at 77, as it continues to decline from Monday’s overheated 86, signalling that it remains in overbought territory. Following a notable 47% two-week rally that beat Bitcoin’s 9% gains over the same period, some investors are now cashing in their gains. Overnight, XRP dipped 1%, suggesting a possible correction ahead. Should a pullback occur, it is expected to find strong support near its former resistance at $3.30. Earlier in 2025, a bullish flag formation emerged, often a precursor to steep upward moves, hinting at a potential push toward the $4 mark by autumn. Cardano ($ADA): Will This Eco-Friendly Ethereum Rival Break New Ground in 2025? Interest in Cardano ($ADA) remains elevated, highlighted by a 45% rise over the past two weeks. This momentum is driven by solid technical indicators and increasing institutional curiosity. ADA, alongside XRP and Solana, was even cited by Donald Trump as a candidate for inclusion in a proposed U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson in 2014, Cardano is renowned for its academic, research-driven development approach and its environmentally friendly Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model, which influenced Ethereum’s own shift away from Proof-of-Work. With a current market capitalization of $31.2 billion, ADA would need to triple in value to surpass Solana and challenge Ethereum’s dominance. ADA has climbed 15% over the last seven days, significantly outperforming Bitcoin, which dipped by half a percent during the same period. Bullish analysis forecasts that ADA’s price nearly double from its current $0.92 to around $1.50 by fall by mid-year, with the most bullish projections aiming for its September 2021 ATH of $3.09 – a level it remains 72% below. A recent bullish flag pattern indicates potential further upside, though ADA’s RSI has hit an overbought reading of 72, cooling from 85 two days ago, implying a wave of profit-taking to consolidate gains is gathering speed. Key resistance lies at $1.15, while strong support is seen between $0.85 and $0.90. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin Crypto Icon Targets Fresh Price Peaks In barely two years, Pepe ($PEPE) has ascended into the ranks of the top three meme coins, leveraging cultural importance and market traction to cement its status. Modelled after Matt Furie’s famed frog character, Pepe has rewarded early investors handsomely, achieving a market capitalization of nearly $5.8 billion. Since its April 2023 debut, Pepe has inspired numerous imitators, though none have rivalled its success. Its popularity reached new heights when X CEO Elon Musk temporarily changed his profile photo to a Pepe-themed image. Now priced at approximately $0.00001371, Pepe has jumped 34% in the past fortnight and 54% over the past month, although it remains 51.1% below its late-2024 ATH of $0.00002803.

2025-07-23 22:30:37+00:00,XRP Is About To Break 8-Year Resistance Against Bitcoin Ahead Of Spot ETF Approval,"After nearly eight years of being trapped under a long-term resistance line, XRP is set to make headlines again as it inches closer to a historic breakout against Bitcoin (BTC). With XRP Spot ETF approvals still pending, this breakout could signal the start of a significant shift in momentum and price trajectory. XRP To Break Major Resistance Against Bitcoin The XRP/BTC trading pair is rapidly approaching a critical technical breakout that could reshape its long-term value outlook. Crypto market expert Gordon noted in his chart analysis on X social media that XRP/BTC is close to breaching an 8-year descending resistance line—a move that could spark a major structural change in the market. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Explodes To January ATH Levels, Will Price Follow Above $3? A breakout from this resistance could not only signal the end of nearly a decade of underperformance against Bitcoin but also serve as a potential precursor to a broader revaluation of XRP. Gordon’s biweekly chart illustrates XRP’s historical struggle to gain ground against Bitcoin, with repeated rejections from a strong descending line that has acted as a barrier since 2017. However, after experiencing long years of consolidation and accumulation, XRP/BTC now appears to be forming a large Symmetrical Triangle, with the current price hovering just below the upper boundary of the formation. Based on Gordon’s analysis, this technical compression suggests an imminent breakout, especially as price action builds momentum. What makes this potential breakout even more intriguing is that XRP’s rising value and current momentum have occurred without any significant bullish catalysts. The upward movement in XRP/BTC comes even before any official news concerning a potential XRP Spot ETF approval. The anticipation surrounding this ETF is already palpable, and a favorable decision could act as a powerful catalyst for continued upside. This scenario aligns with Gordon’s assessment that a breakout from the 8-year trendline could be a gateway to a generational wealth opportunity. 2025 XRP Spot ETF Approval Odds Hit 95% According to new data shared by market expert Steph is Crypto, XRP has emerged as one of the front-runners in the race for Spot ETF approval in the United States (US). The analyst has stated that the probability of an XRP ETF approval by the US SEC in 2025 has increased to a whopping 95%. Related Reading: XRP Wave 3 Could Repeat 600% Surge From Nov 2025, Target Set For $15 XRP currently shares the highest projected odds of approval alongside Litecoin and Solana, signaling a major shift in sentiment toward altcoin-based ETFs. Already, a growing number of institutional asset managers are investing in this ETF, including Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Canary, and others. Just a few days ago, reports also revealed that the SEC has officially approved the conversion of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund into an ETF, which will include assets such as XRP, BTC, ETH, and others.

A breakout from this resistance could not only signal the end of nearly a decade of underperformance against Bitcoin but also serve as a potential precursor to a broader revaluation of XRP. Gordon’s biweekly chart illustrates XRP’s historical struggle to gain ground against Bitcoin, with repeated rejections from a strong descending line that has acted as a barrier since 2017. However, after experiencing long years of consolidation and accumulation, XRP/BTC now appears to be forming a large Symmetrical Triangle, with the current price hovering just below the upper boundary of the formation. Based on Gordon’s analysis, this technical compression suggests an imminent breakout, especially as price action builds momentum. What makes this potential breakout even more intriguing is that XRP’s rising value and current momentum have occurred without any significant bullish catalysts. The upward movement in XRP/BTC comes even before any official news concerning a potential XRP Spot ETF approval. The anticipation surrounding this ETF is already palpable, and a favorable decision could act as a powerful catalyst for continued upside. This scenario aligns with Gordon’s assessment that a breakout from the 8-year trendline could be a gateway to a generational wealth opportunity. 2025 XRP Spot ETF Approval Odds Hit 95% According to new data shared by market expert Steph is Crypto, XRP has emerged as one of the front-runners in the race for Spot ETF approval in the United States (US). The analyst has stated that the probability of an XRP ETF approval by the US SEC in 2025 has increased to a whopping 95%.

Already, a growing number of institutional asset managers are investing in this ETF, including Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, WisdomTree, Canary, and others. Just a few days ago, reports also revealed that the SEC has officially approved the conversion of the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund into an ETF, which will include assets such as XRP, BTC, ETH, and others.

2025-07-23 22:50:23+00:00,Unveiling the Mammoth 250 Million USDC Minting: What It Means for Crypto,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Mammoth 250 Million USDC Minting: What It Means for Crypto The cryptocurrency world is always abuzz with activity, and few events capture attention quite like a significant movement of stablecoins. Recently, the popular blockchain tracker, Whale Alert, sent ripples across the crypto community with a report of a substantial USDC minting event: a staggering 250 million USDC tokens were freshly minted at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just a technical detail; it’s a financial pulse that often signals underlying shifts in market demand, liquidity, and investor sentiment. But what exactly does such a massive USDC minting mean for the broader crypto landscape, and why should you pay attention? What Exactly is USDC Minting and Why Does It Happen? Before diving into the implications, let’s clarify what USDC minting entails. USDC, or USD Coin, is a prominent stablecoin, meaning its value is pegged to a stable asset, in this case, the U.S. dollar. For every USDC token in circulation, there is a corresponding dollar (or dollar-equivalent asset) held in reserve. This backing is crucial for maintaining its stability and trustworthiness. The Process: When new USDC is ‘minted,’ it means new tokens are created and put into circulation. This isn’t arbitrary; it happens in response to demand. Typically, large institutions, crypto exchanges, or wealthy individuals (often referred to as ‘whales’) deposit fiat currency (like USD) with Circle, the issuer of USDC. In return, Circle mints an equivalent amount of USDC and sends it to the depositor. Meeting Demand: The primary reason for such a large USDC minting event is usually to meet an increase in demand for stablecoins. This demand can come from various sources: Traders looking to move capital into the crypto ecosystem without direct exposure to volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Institutions seeking a stable on-ramp or off-ramp for large transactions. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols requiring stable liquidity. Users looking for a secure, stable asset to hold during market volatility. The 250 million USDC minting reported by Whale Alert therefore indicates a significant influx of capital into the stablecoin ecosystem, suggesting that large players are preparing to deploy this capital within the crypto space. The Tremendous Impact of 250 Million USDC Minting on the Crypto Market When such a substantial amount of USDC enters circulation, it doesn’t just sit idle. It represents potential buying power that can influence various facets of the crypto market. The implications of this USDC minting event are multi-faceted: 1. Enhanced Liquidity: This new supply of USDC immediately boosts overall market liquidity. More stablecoins mean more capital available for trading, lending, and other financial activities within the crypto ecosystem. This can lead to tighter spreads and more efficient markets. 2. Potential for Asset Purchases: A common assumption following a large stablecoin mint is that the minted funds will eventually be used to purchase other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). While not guaranteed, it’s a strong indicator of potential bullish pressure. Large investors often convert fiat to stablecoins before deploying capital into volatile assets, as it offers flexibility and speed. 3. Investor Sentiment: Significant stablecoin mints can also serve as a psychological boost for the market. They signal that large capital is entering the space, which can be interpreted as a sign of institutional interest and confidence, potentially encouraging other investors. To put this 250 million USDC minting into perspective, consider the following: Aspect Significance of $250 Million USDC Mint Market Liquidity A substantial injection, increasing capital available for trading and DeFi. Potential Buying Power Often precedes purchases of major cryptocurrencies like BTC or ETH. Investor Confidence Signals strong institutional or whale interest, potentially boosting sentiment. Stablecoin Dominance Reinforces USDC’s role as a key stablecoin for large-scale transactions. Is This Massive USDC Minting a Bullish Signal? Exploring Market Implications The question on many investors’ minds is whether this 250 million USDC minting is a harbinger of a bullish market turn. While a large stablecoin mint can be interpreted as a precursor to buying activity, it’s essential to consider the nuances: Not Always Direct Buys: While many assume minted stablecoins will immediately flow into Bitcoin or Ethereum, they could also be used for other purposes, such as providing liquidity to DeFi protocols, facilitating OTC (Over-The-Counter) trades that don’t directly impact exchange prices, or simply being held as a safe haven during uncertain times. Meeting Existing Demand: Sometimes, large mints simply reflect an increase in organic demand for stablecoins for various operational needs within the crypto economy, rather than a speculative move.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, understanding the foundational infrastructure behind AI models is crucial, as it impacts everything from data processing to decentralized applications. Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai expressed significant enthusiasm for a groundbreaking collaboration: Google Cloud’s partnership with OpenAI. This alliance, seemingly paradoxical given OpenAI’s role as a major AI rival to Google, underscores a complex and strategic maneuver in the high-stakes AI race. The Strategic Alliance: Google Cloud OpenAI The news that Google Cloud is now a supplier for OpenAI’s demanding cloud computing needs has sent ripples across the tech industry. Sundar Pichai’s public statement on Google’s second-quarter earnings call highlighted his excitement, emphasizing Google Cloud’s nature as an open platform. ""We are very excited to be partnering with them on Google Cloud,"" Pichai stated, reaffirming the company’s commitment to supporting leading AI labs and startups. This partnership is not merely a transaction; it represents a calculated move to capture a significant customer in the burgeoning AI infrastructure market, even if that customer is a direct competitor to Google’s core search business. For crypto enthusiasts, this highlights the immense computational power required to build and scale advanced AI, a challenge that decentralized networks also face in their quest for efficiency and scalability. Why Are AI Partnerships Becoming So Crucial? In the current AI landscape, no single entity can entirely dominate every aspect of development and deployment. This reality makes strategic AI Partnerships indispensable. OpenAI, despite being heavily backed by Microsoft and using Azure as its primary cloud provider, faces immense demand for computational resources, particularly Nvidia GPUs, which are critical for training and serving its powerful AI models like ChatGPT. The decision to tap Google Cloud, alongside Microsoft and Oracle, demonstrates the critical need for diversified cloud infrastructure to meet the insatiable appetite for AI processing power. Such collaborations allow companies to leverage existing infrastructure, accelerate development, and mitigate supply chain constraints, ultimately pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve. This collaborative yet competitive environment is reminiscent of the interdependencies seen in the broader blockchain ecosystem, where different protocols and layers often collaborate to achieve shared goals. Key drivers for these crucial partnerships include: Resource Scarcity: High-demand components like Nvidia GPUs are limited, necessitating diverse suppliers. Scalability Needs: Training and deploying large AI models require massive, flexible cloud infrastructure. Accelerated Innovation: Access to varied computing environments can speed up research and development. Risk Diversification: Relying on multiple providers reduces single points of failure. Navigating the Future: Google AI Strategy in Focus Google’s overarching Google AI Strategy is undergoing a significant transformation. For years, the company focused on integrating AI into its existing products, particularly Search. However, with the rapid ascent of generative AI models like ChatGPT, Google has shifted its focus squarely on developing leading AI models and products to directly compete. This involves substantial capital expenditure, with an extra $10 billion allocated this year to bolster its AI capabilities. While ChatGPT poses a direct threat to Google Search, the OpenAI deal simultaneously marks a massive new customer for Google Cloud, providing a lucrative revenue stream. This delicate balancing act reflects Google’s determination to lead in AI, even if it means empowering rivals in one domain to strengthen another. The implications for data privacy and centralization are also points of interest for the crypto community, as power consolidates around a few major cloud providers.

Calling ETH the “iPhone” of crypto, the supporter argues that its smart contract capabilities and role as a leading tokenization platform give it a clear advantage over BTC. Why Ethereum Trumps Bitcoin In a recent interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Andrew Keys, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ether Machine , a public Ethereum yield and infrastructure company, weighed in on the longstanding crypto debate , declaring Ethereum as the frontrunner over Bitcoin and championing it as the better blockchain. He highlighted Ethereum’s growing utility, steady yield potential, and long-term value as a leading cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Keys addressed a series of questions on why people should invest in Ethereum through the Ether Machine and whether he believes that Bitcoin has outperformed ETH over the past decade. The Ether Machine CEO responded by calling Bitcoin a landline and Ethereum an iPhone, implying that the former is outdated while the latter represents the future of blockchain innovation. He also firmly rejected the idea that Bitcoin has outpaced Ethereum in the past 10 years, noting that ETH has surged by 30x in that period. Keys drew sharp comparisons between the two blockchains, pointing out that Bitcoin supports just a single asset that can be transferred peer to peer. In contrast, he states that Ethereum can tokenize virtually any digital asset , enabling real-world use cases like stablecoins. Keys emphasized that, unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum can also embed any type of digital asset, including gold, stocks, bonds, derivatives, and oil, into virtual legal agreements. He noted that BTC currently lacks intrinsic return, while ETH functions as a productive asset that generates income by staking and participating in the decentralized financial economy. The Ether Machine CEO drew more parallels between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s functionality and efficiency. He disclosed that Bitcoin relies on a Proof of Work (PoW) mining system , which requires significant hardware, electricity, and real estate. On the other hand, Ethereum’s Proof of Stake (PoW) mechanism eliminates those needs, making it a more efficient and environmentally friendly blockchain. When asked if he held any Bitcoin, Keys revealed he didn’t—a choice likely driven by his view of Bitcoin as inferior to Ethereum. Demonstrating this conviction, the CEO recently invested a massive $600 million worth of ETH from his personal balance sheet into the Ether Machine. ETH Set To Gain The Most From GENIUS Act During his interview, Keys stated that Ethereum is poised to become the biggest beneficiary of the recently passed and signed GENIUS Act —primarily due to the blockchain’s pivotal role as a stablecoin generator.

The case revolves around a low-cap art-themed altcoin named Pica Coin and its alleged mastermind Song Ja-ho, Park’s ex-boyfriend. At the time of the launch, Park was reportedly listed as Pica’s Chief Communications Officer and Advisor. Park Gyuri: Crypto Accusations Continue Last week, prosecutors summoned Park as a witness in the Song fraud case. She told a branch of the Seoul Southern District Court that she had played no part in any illegal crypto schemes or efforts to manipulate token prices. Park Gyuri (center) with her Kara groupmates in October 2009. (Source: Kiyoung Kim [CC BY 2.0]) She claimed that she thought Pica was an above-board art-technology startup. Park also claimed that she worked as a salaried worker at Pica “for a year as a curator and publicity manager, planning and promoting exhibitions for artists.” The K-pop star added: “I knew nothing about cryptoassets. And I did not want any photos of me to feature in the Pica Coin white paper. I have never participated in or benefited from illegal coin operations. I have never made any profit from [this coin].” Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past week. (Source: CoinGecko) ‘I Sold My BTC to Buy Altcoin,’ Star Claims Furthermore, Park claimed that she had invested 60 million won (currently $43,566) in Pica Coin in April 2021. She said that she raised the funds for the purchase by selling her personal Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. But the former Kara member said she “lost everything” when the Pica Coin was delisted from the Upbit crypto exchange two months later, in June 2021. However, the Pica Coin CEO Seong Hae-joong told the media outlet iMBC that Park’s claims were untrue. Seong said that Song “directly compensated her with 60 million won in cash in December of the same year, acting out of pity for her.” This was despite the fact that Park and Song reportedly broke up in September 2021. Seung provided the media outlet with screenshots of an alleged conversation about the “compensation” between Park and Song on KakaoTalk. The screenshots appear to show Park asking Song when exactly he would send her the money on December 8, 2021. To this, he appears to respond: “Before the end of the month.” Park also appears to “correct” Song’s intention to send 50 million, saying: “It wasn’t 50 million, but actually 60 million.” Prosecutors Launched Legal Case in 2023 Seong also stated that Park’s claims that she had never made any profit from crypto were “untrue.” He asserted that Park’s assertions were “one-sided” and “lacked credulity.” The media outlet said that it had contacted Park’s talent agency Big Boss Entertainment with multiple unsuccessful requests for comment. However, the newspaper Maeil Kyungjae quoted Park’s representatives as stating: “We cannot comment on matters connected to Ms. Park’s private life.” Park has previously expressed her exasperation with the case on her social media pages, asking rhetorically why she is not being allowed to move on from her involvement with Pica. https://twitter.com/TheKoreaHerald/status/1854717878622470231 Police arrested Song in 2023 on charges of fraud and breach of trust. Prosecutors have accused him of soliciting investments for artworks he did not own. Officials also think Song may have also manipulated Pica Coin prices to his own advantage. Park debuted with Kara in 2007, with the group disbanding in 2016. Kara reformed in 2022 and is currently touring Asia, with performances slated for Yokohama, Japan, and Macau in August.

The screenshots appear to show Park asking Song when exactly he would send her the money on December 8, 2021. To this, he appears to respond: “Before the end of the month.” Park also appears to “correct” Song’s intention to send 50 million, saying: “It wasn’t 50 million, but actually 60 million.” Prosecutors Launched Legal Case in 2023 Seong also stated that Park’s claims that she had never made any profit from crypto were “untrue.” He asserted that Park’s assertions were “one-sided” and “lacked credulity.” The media outlet said that it had contacted Park’s talent agency Big Boss Entertainment with multiple unsuccessful requests for comment. However, the newspaper Maeil Kyungjae quoted Park’s representatives as stating: “We cannot comment on matters connected to Ms. Park’s private life.” Park has previously expressed her exasperation with the case on her social media pages, asking rhetorically why she is not being allowed to move on from her involvement with Pica. https://twitter.com/TheKoreaHerald/status/1854717878622470231 Police arrested Song in 2023 on charges of fraud and breach of trust. Prosecutors have accused him of soliciting investments for artworks he did not own. Officials also think Song may have also manipulated Pica Coin prices to his own advantage. Park debuted with Kara in 2007, with the group disbanding in 2016. Kara reformed in 2022 and is currently touring Asia, with performances slated for Yokohama, Japan, and Macau in August.

2025-07-23 23:30:09+00:00,Time Traveler Says Do Nothing With XRP Until 2030. Here’s why,"A prominent member of the XRP community, known as “Time Traveler,” recently advised investors to refrain from any activity involving their XRP tokens until 2030. The statement, shared on X, generated substantial discussion among XRP supporters. In a follow-up post, Traveler clarified that his position is based on a strong belief in XRP’s long-term value and that holders should refrain from selling, regardless of short-term price fluctuations or external developments. A Long-Term Strategy for XRP Traveler’s stance reflects a broader sentiment gaining traction within the XRP community, that significant value appreciation is more likely to occur over the long term. His message discourages any form of premature selling, especially in response to temporary price spikes or market events. This is financial advice. Do nothing with XRP until 2030. — 𝚃𝚒𝚖𝚎 𝚃𝚛𝚊𝚟𝚎𝚕𝚎𝚛 (@Traveler2236) July 22, 2025 This perspective aligns with the growing narrative that XRP’s role in the future of digital finance, particularly in cross-border payments and tokenized asset settlement, could drive substantial price appreciation by the end of the decade. Several market analysts and community figures have issued forecasts that support this long-hold strategy. Analyst Forecasts Support the 2030 Outlook Price predictions for XRP in the coming years further reinforce the logic behind a long-term hold. Analysts at Changelly, for example, forecast that XRP may start the year 2030 at around $19.21 and could reach up to $32.60 by year-end. If that projection holds, an investor holding 10,000 XRP today, currently valued at $32,900 at $3.29, could potentially see that investment rise to $326,000 by 2030. Telegaon, another forecasting platform, offers an even more optimistic scenario. Their analysts estimate that XRP could trade between $36.86 and $48.03 by 2030. At the higher end of that range, the same 10,000 tokens would be worth approximately $480,000, translating to a gain of $447,400 on today’s valuation. Influential Community Voices Weigh In Time Traveler is not alone in advocating for a long-term holding approach. Other figures in the XRP space have issued similar warnings against selling too early. Edoardo Farina, another community advocate, recently cautioned that selling XRP at $10 could be a major missed opportunity. He emphasized that even large-scale disruptions such as geopolitical conflict or economic downturns would not dissuade him from holding until a $100 valuation is reached.

According to this individual, XRP may eventually decouple from Bitcoin’s influence, which could lead to independent and sustained growth in its market value. While some voices promote holding through 2030 without taking profits, others offer a more conservative strategy. EGRAG Crypto, a well-followed analyst in the space, has advised a gradual profit-taking approach. He argues that locking in gains incrementally, rather than waiting for a single price peak, allows investors to reduce risk while still benefiting from future appreciation. This strategy can help mitigate potential losses in the event of a market correction and ensure that investors do not miss opportunities to realize returns during XRP’s rise. The current debate within the XRP community highlights two distinct schools of thought, one advocating for long-term patience and another promoting strategic exits. There is no certainty that XRP will reach $20, $100, or beyond by 2030.

2025-07-23 23:55:23+00:00,Imminent Federal Reserve Chair Nomination: What It Means for Crypto,"BitcoinWorld Imminent Federal Reserve Chair Nomination: What It Means for Crypto In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, every major economic announcement from traditional finance often sends ripples across digital asset markets. A recent statement by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has captured significant attention, hinting at an imminent decision that could profoundly influence the economic landscape and, by extension, your crypto portfolio. According to a report from PiQ on X, Secretary Bessent informed Fox News that a nomination for the next Federal Reserve chair is anticipated to be announced as early as December or January. This revelation marks a pivotal moment, as the leadership of the Federal Reserve holds immense sway over monetary policy, interest rates, and the overall economic climate – factors that are inextricably linked to the volatility and valuation of cryptocurrencies. Understanding the Role of the Federal Reserve Chair The Federal Reserve chair is arguably one of the most powerful economic figures globally. This individual leads the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. Their primary responsibilities include: Setting Monetary Policy: Decisions on interest rates, quantitative easing (QE), and quantitative tightening (QT) directly impact the cost of borrowing, inflation, and liquidity in the financial system. Fostering Financial Stability: Overseeing the banking system and working to prevent financial crises. Promoting Maximum Employment and Stable Prices: These are the Fed’s dual mandate, guiding all policy decisions. For crypto enthusiasts, understanding these roles is crucial. When the Fed adopts a hawkish stance (e.g., raising interest rates), it typically strengthens the dollar and makes riskier assets, like cryptocurrencies, less attractive. Conversely, a dovish approach (e.g., lowering rates or QE) can inject liquidity, potentially boosting crypto valuations as investors seek higher returns. Why an Imminent Federal Reserve Chair Nomination Matters for Crypto The appointment of a new Federal Reserve chair isn’t just a bureaucratic change; it signals potential shifts in economic philosophy and policy direction. The crypto market, known for its sensitivity to macroeconomic trends, often reacts strongly to such developments. Here’s why this nomination is particularly significant: Policy Continuity vs. Change: Will the new chair maintain the current trajectory of monetary policy, or will they introduce a fresh approach? A shift towards a more dovish or hawkish stance could dramatically alter market dynamics. Inflation Expectations: The Fed’s stance on inflation control directly influences investor confidence. If the market perceives the new chair as more aggressive in combating inflation, it could lead to tighter monetary conditions, impacting crypto. Interest Rate Outlook: Higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, making borrowing more expensive for businesses and individuals. This can reduce speculative investment in assets like crypto. Conversely, lower rates can encourage risk-taking. Investor Sentiment: Uncertainty surrounding leadership changes can lead to market volatility. Crypto investors often look for clarity and stability, and a new chair brings a period of assessment. The market will be scrutinizing the nominee’s past statements, economic philosophy, and public perception to gauge their potential impact on future policy decisions. This anticipation alone can create significant price movements in digital assets. Navigating Potential Shifts: What a New Federal Reserve Chair Could Mean for Markets The identity and economic leanings of the next Federal Reserve chair will be paramount. Generally, nominees are categorized into two broad camps based on their monetary policy preferences: Hawkish Nominee A hawkish individual prioritizes controlling inflation, even if it means slower economic growth or higher unemployment. Their policy toolkit often includes: Aggressive interest rate hikes. Rapid quantitative tightening (reducing the Fed’s balance sheet). A strong dollar policy. Impact on Crypto: A hawkish Fed typically leads to a ‘risk-off’ environment. This means investors might pull funds from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies and move towards safer havens like U.S. Treasury bonds or cash. Higher interest rates also increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding assets like Bitcoin, potentially leading to downward price pressure. Dovish Nominee A dovish individual prioritizes economic growth and employment, often willing to tolerate higher inflation to achieve these goals. Their policy preferences might include: Lower interest rates or maintaining accommodative policies. Slower quantitative tightening or even quantitative easing. A weaker dollar policy.

2025-07-24 00:25:23+00:00,Unlocking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does ‘Greed’ at 71 Crucially Mean?,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does ‘Greed’ at 71 Crucially Mean? Are you feeling the pulse of the crypto market? The cryptocurrency world is a rollercoaster of emotions, and understanding its sentiment can be just as crucial as analyzing price charts. Right now, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched barometer, has registered a score of 71 as of July 24. While this marks a slight dip of three points from the previous day, it firmly keeps us nestled in the “Greed” zone. But what does this really mean for investors and enthusiasts? Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Vital Sentiment Barometer The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by the innovative software development platform Alternative, serves as a powerful indicator of the prevailing emotional state within the cryptocurrency market. Its scale ranges from 0 to 100, where a score of 0 screams “Extreme Fear” and 100 shouts “Extreme Greed.” Think of it as a temperature gauge for investor psychology – are people panicking and selling, or are they getting overly exuberant and buying everything in sight? This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a carefully constructed metric designed to capture the collective mood. Why is understanding this sentiment so important? Because emotions often drive irrational decisions in financial markets. When fear takes over, investors might sell off assets at a loss, missing out on potential rebounds. Conversely, unchecked greed can lead to speculative bubbles and eventual corrections. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to provide a counter-narrative to these emotional swings, offering a data-driven perspective. What Does a Score of 71 in the ‘Greed’ Zone Imply for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A score of 71, firmly within the “Greed” zone (typically above 50), suggests that market participants are feeling optimistic, perhaps even euphoric. This level of greed can indicate several things: Strong Buying Pressure: Investors are actively accumulating assets, anticipating further price increases. Increased Risk Appetite: People might be more willing to take on higher risks, perhaps investing in more volatile altcoins. Potential Overextension: Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections. It’s a signal that the market might be getting overheated. Reduced Volatility Aversion: Traders are less concerned about price swings, viewing them as opportunities rather than threats. While optimism is generally good, extreme greed can be a warning sign. It often means that prices are being driven up by speculation rather than fundamental value, making the market susceptible to sharp pullbacks. Understanding the implications of a high Crypto Fear & Greed Index score is paramount for making informed decisions. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? A Look Under the Hood The brilliance of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach. It doesn’t rely on a single data point but rather aggregates information from six distinct factors, each weighted to reflect its significance in gauging market sentiment. Let’s break down these crucial components: 1. Volatility (25%) Volatility measures how much the price of Bitcoin, the dominant cryptocurrency, fluctuates. A sudden surge in volatility, especially to the downside, often signals fear in the market. Conversely, sustained low volatility might indicate complacency or a build-up before a significant move. The index assesses current volatility and compares it to average values over the past 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility, particularly when prices are falling, contributes to a lower index score (more fear), while stable or rising prices with moderate volatility can indicate increasing greed. 2. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) This component analyzes the current volume and momentum of the Bitcoin market. High buying volumes accompanied by significant price increases suggest strong bullish momentum and contribute to a higher greed score. Conversely, low volume during price drops or high selling volume indicates fear. It’s about the strength and direction of price movements, reflecting whether investors are confidently pushing prices up or nervously selling off. 3. Social Media (15%) The crypto community thrives on social media, making platforms like Twitter (now X) and Reddit crucial for gauging sentiment. The index monitors specific hashtags, keywords, and the overall sentiment of crypto-related posts. A surge in positive sentiment, mentions of “to the moon,” or discussions about rapid gains can push the index towards greed. Conversely, widespread negative discussions, FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), or panic-selling discussions contribute to fear. This factor captures the collective chatter and emotional temperature of the online crypto world. 4. Surveys (15%) – Currently Paused Historically, this component involved weekly polls where users were asked about their perception of the market.

BitcoinWorld Unlocking the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does ‘Greed’ at 71 Crucially Mean? Are you feeling the pulse of the crypto market? The cryptocurrency world is a rollercoaster of emotions, and understanding its sentiment can be just as crucial as analyzing price charts. Right now, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a widely watched barometer, has registered a score of 71 as of July 24. While this marks a slight dip of three points from the previous day, it firmly keeps us nestled in the “Greed” zone. But what does this really mean for investors and enthusiasts? Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Vital Sentiment Barometer The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , provided by the innovative software development platform Alternative, serves as a powerful indicator of the prevailing emotional state within the cryptocurrency market. Its scale ranges from 0 to 100, where a score of 0 screams “Extreme Fear” and 100 shouts “Extreme Greed.” Think of it as a temperature gauge for investor psychology – are people panicking and selling, or are they getting overly exuberant and buying everything in sight? This index isn’t just a random number; it’s a carefully constructed metric designed to capture the collective mood. Why is understanding this sentiment so important? Because emotions often drive irrational decisions in financial markets. When fear takes over, investors might sell off assets at a loss, missing out on potential rebounds. Conversely, unchecked greed can lead to speculative bubbles and eventual corrections. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to provide a counter-narrative to these emotional swings, offering a data-driven perspective. What Does a Score of 71 in the ‘Greed’ Zone Imply for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A score of 71, firmly within the “Greed” zone (typically above 50), suggests that market participants are feeling optimistic, perhaps even euphoric. This level of greed can indicate several things: Strong Buying Pressure: Investors are actively accumulating assets, anticipating further price increases. Increased Risk Appetite: People might be more willing to take on higher risks, perhaps investing in more volatile altcoins. Potential Overextension: Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market corrections. It’s a signal that the market might be getting overheated. Reduced Volatility Aversion: Traders are less concerned about price swings, viewing them as opportunities rather than threats. While optimism is generally good, extreme greed can be a warning sign.

2025-07-24 00:30:24+00:00,Shocking Reality: AI Coding Challenge Reveals Grim First Results,"BitcoinWorld Shocking Reality: AI Coding Challenge Reveals Grim First Results In the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency and blockchain, artificial intelligence (AI) is often hailed as the next frontier, promising to revolutionize everything from trading algorithms to smart contract auditing. Yet, a recent AI coding challenge has delivered a stark reminder that even the most advanced AI models still have significant hurdles to overcome. The inaugural K Prize, a rigorous competition designed to test AI’s real-world programming capabilities, has just announced its first results, and they are far from what the widespread AI hype might suggest. This outcome offers a crucial reality check for developers, investors, and enthusiasts alike, prompting a deeper look into the true state of AI’s readiness for complex tasks and its potential impact on the digital asset landscape. The K Prize: A New Benchmark for AI Software Engineers The nonprofit Laude Institute, in collaboration with Databricks and Perplexity co-founder Andy Konwinski, recently unveiled the results of the K Prize, a multi-round AI coding challenge aimed at pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve in software engineering. This innovative competition seeks to provide a more accurate assessment of AI’s ability to solve real-world programming problems. The first winner, Brazilian prompt engineer Eduardo Rocha de Andrade, secured the $50,000 prize. However, the most striking detail was his winning score: a mere 7.5% of questions answered correctly. This remarkably low figure underscores the profound difficulty of the challenge and sets a new, more realistic bar for aspiring AI software engineers . Andy Konwinski, a visionary in the tech space, emphasized the importance of a challenging benchmark. “We’re glad we built a benchmark that is actually hard,” Konwinski stated, highlighting that true progress requires rigorous evaluation. He also pointed out that the K Prize’s design, which limits compute and favors smaller, open models, aims to level the playing field, making it accessible for a wider range of participants beyond just large labs with extensive resources. This commitment to open innovation is further cemented by Konwinski’s pledge of $1 million to the first open-source model that can achieve a score higher than 90% on the test. This substantial incentive is designed to catalyze breakthrough advancements in the field, encouraging a focus on genuine problem-solving capabilities rather than merely optimizing for existing, potentially contaminated datasets. The K Prize is not just another competition; it’s a philosophical statement about the future of AI. By prioritizing real-world applicability and preventing data contamination, it pushes AI development away from theoretical achievements and towards practical, deployable solutions. This approach is particularly relevant for sectors like blockchain, where the precision and security of code are paramount. Imagine AI that can reliably audit smart contracts or identify vulnerabilities in decentralized applications; such capabilities demand a level of accuracy and robustness that current benchmarks might not adequately measure. Why Are AI Benchmarks So Hard to Conquer? The Contamination Conundrum The K Prize’s methodology draws inspiration from the well-known SWE-Bench system, which evaluates models against flagged issues from GitHub. This approach tests how effectively AI models can address genuine programming problems encountered in live development environments. However, a critical distinction sets the K Prize apart: its design as a “contamination-free version of SWE-Bench.” While SWE-Bench uses a fixed set of problems that models might inadvertently train against, the K Prize employs a timed entry system to prevent benchmark-specific training. For the first round, models were submitted by March 12th, and the test was constructed using only GitHub issues flagged after that date, ensuring a truly novel set of problems. The 7.5% top score on the K Prize starkly contrasts with SWE-Bench’s reported top scores of 75% on its ‘Verified’ test and 34% on its harder ‘Full’ test. This significant disparity raises crucial questions about the efficacy of current AI benchmarks . Konwinski acknowledges that the difference could stem from contamination on SWE-Bench, where models might have indirectly learned solutions, or simply the inherent difficulty of continuously sourcing new, untainted GitHub issues. The challenge of benchmark contamination is a growing concern in the AI community. If models are trained on data that is too similar to the test set, their reported performance may not accurately reflect their ability to generalize to new, unseen problems. This can create a false sense of progress, leading to overconfidence in AI capabilities. Princeton researcher Sayash Kapoor echoes this sentiment, stating, “Without such experiments, we can’t actually tell if the issue is contamination, or even just targeti",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-coding-challenge-results/,TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,AI News|AI|AI development|K Prize|machine learning|Software Engineering,BTC,"Shocking Reality: AI Coding Challenge Reveals Grim First Results.

The Altcoin Season Index , a crucial metric for understanding market dynamics, recently dropped to 41. This significant shift signals that the market is currently entrenched in ‘Bitcoin Season.’ But what exactly does this mean for your digital asset portfolio, and how should you navigate these changing tides? Let’s dive deep into the numbers and uncover the implications. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index: What Does 41 Signify? The Altcoin Season Index , meticulously tracked by cryptocurrency price data platform CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 41 at 00:27 UTC on July 24. This figure marks a notable 12-point decrease from the previous day’s report, as highlighted by Bitcoin World. This downtrend unequivocally points towards a market environment where Bitcoin is outperforming the broader altcoin market. To truly grasp the significance of this number, it’s essential to understand how the index works: The Core Metric: The index specifically compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CMC over the past 90 days. It excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. Defining Seasons: Altcoin Season: Occurs when at least 75% of these top 100 coins have outperformed Bitcoin over the 90-day period. The index would typically be at 75 or higher. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, this period is characterized by 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins managing to outperform Bitcoin. An index score of 25 or lower would firmly indicate Bitcoin Season. The Range: The index scores range from 1 to 100, providing a clear continuum from strong Bitcoin dominance to strong altcoin outperformance. A score of 41, while not at the extreme low, certainly places us firmly in Bitcoin’s territory. This metric serves as a vital compass for investors, helping them gauge the prevailing sentiment and identify potential shifts in market leadership between Bitcoin and altcoins. Why Is the Market in Bitcoin Season? Analyzing the Factors Behind the Altcoin Season Index Drop The recent drop in the Altcoin Season Index isn’t an isolated event; it’s a culmination of various market forces. Several key factors often contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance: 1. Flight to Safety and Macroeconomic Headwinds In times of economic uncertainty or market volatility, investors often seek refuge in assets perceived as safer. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin, being the largest and most established cryptocurrency, often acts as this ‘safe haven.’ When global macroeconomic concerns, such as inflation fears, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions, arise, capital tends to flow from riskier altcoins into Bitcoin, pushing its dominance higher. 2. Institutional Interest and Spot ETF Developments A significant driver of Bitcoin’s recent strength has been the growing institutional interest, particularly with the approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). These investment vehicles provide a regulated and accessible way for traditional finance players to gain exposure to Bitcoin. This influx of institutional capital primarily targets Bitcoin, leading to a disproportionate increase in its market capitalization compared to altcoins. 3. Bitcoin Halving Cycle Influence Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events have preceded periods of significant price appreciation, often pulling the entire market higher. However, in the immediate aftermath or leading up to a halving, Bitcoin tends to consolidate its position as the primary asset, with capital flowing into it in anticipation of future gains. This often means altcoins might lag initially, awaiting Bitcoin’s lead before their own rallies commence. 4. Liquidity Concentration During periods of lower overall market liquidity, capital tends to concentrate in the most liquid assets. Bitcoin, with its deep order books and high trading volume, naturally attracts and retains liquidity more effectively than most altcoins. This concentration can exacerbate Bitcoin’s outperformance, as it becomes easier to trade in and out of without significant price slippage. Understanding these underlying dynamics is crucial for any investor looking to make informed decisions during a Bitcoin Season. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Season: Strategies for Investors When the Altcoin Season Index signals Bitcoin dominance, it’s not a time for panic, but for strategic adjustment. Here are some actionable insights: 1. Prioritize Bitcoin Exposure In a Bitcoin Season, focusing on Bitcoin itself often proves to be the most prudent strategy. If you believe in the long-term potential of the crypto market, increasing your Bitcoin allocation or dollar-cost averaging into Bitcoin can be a sensible approach. Bitcoin tends to be less volatile than altcoins during these periods and is often the first to recover and lead the next bull run. 2.

Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, has once again shattered expectations, surging past the monumental $119,000 mark. This isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a significant milestone that underscores the growing confidence and robust momentum behind the leading cryptocurrency. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the Bitcoin price reached an impressive $119,015.21 on the Binance USDT market, signaling a pivotal moment in its ongoing journey. This remarkable ascent has ignited discussions across global financial markets, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to ponder the forces driving this powerful rally and what it signifies for the broader crypto landscape. What’s Propelling the Bitcoin Price to Unprecedented Levels? Understanding the current surge in Bitcoin price requires a look at a confluence of factors, both macroeconomic and specific to the crypto ecosystem. This isn’t a singular event but rather the culmination of various influences creating a potent bullish environment. Several key elements appear to be playing crucial roles in this extraordinary ascent: Institutional Influx: One of the most significant drivers has been the increasing participation of institutional investors. The approval and launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for traditional finance players to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Large corporations and asset managers are allocating significant capital, viewing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and a potential hedge against inflation. This institutional validation lends credibility and stability to the market, attracting even more capital. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: In an era of economic uncertainty, high inflation, and fluctuating traditional markets, Bitcoin’s narrative as a ‘digital gold’ or a store of value has gained considerable traction. Investors are seeking alternative assets to preserve wealth, and Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and finite supply make it an attractive option. The weakening of traditional fiat currencies and the search for inflation hedges often push investors towards scarce assets like Bitcoin. The Halving Effect: The anticipation of Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoins entering the market, consistently fuels price rallies. While the immediate impact is often debated, the long-term historical trend suggests that supply shocks created by halving events lead to increased scarcity and, consequently, higher prices, assuming demand remains strong or increases. Investors often front-run this event, driving up the Bitcoin price in the months leading up to it. Growing Retail Interest: Beyond institutional money, renewed interest from retail investors is also contributing to the upward momentum. As the price climbs, media attention intensifies, drawing in new participants driven by a fear of missing out (FOMO) and the allure of significant returns. User-friendly platforms and increased accessibility have lowered the barrier to entry for individual investors. Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including improvements in scalability, security, and broader adoption of the Lightning Network for faster transactions, enhances Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. A robust and evolving network reinforces confidence in its long-term viability. A Historical Perspective: Understanding the Bitcoin Price Journey To truly appreciate the current surge, it’s essential to place the Bitcoin price within its historical context. Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by dramatic peaks and valleys, each cycle teaching valuable lessons about market dynamics and investor psychology. This latest move above $119,000 is not an isolated incident but part of a larger, evolving narrative of adoption and maturation. The Early Days and First Rallies: From its humble beginnings, Bitcoin’s price first gained significant attention in 2013, reaching hundreds of dollars before experiencing its first major correction. These early cycles established its volatile nature but also demonstrated its incredible recovery potential. The 2017 Mania: The year 2017 saw Bitcoin explode into mainstream consciousness, surging from under $1,000 at the start of the year to nearly $20,000 by December. This bull run was largely fueled by retail speculation and introduced cryptocurrency to a global audience. Following this peak, Bitcoin entered a prolonged bear market, often referred to as a ‘crypto winter.’ The 2021 Bull Run: After recovering from the 2018-2020 slump, Bitcoin embarked on another historic rally in 2020-2021, driven significantly by institutional adoption and the macroeconomic environment following global pandemic responses.

The Halving Effect: The anticipation of Bitcoin’s quadrennial halving event, which reduces the supply of new Bitcoins entering the market, consistently fuels price rallies. While the immediate impact is often debated, the long-term historical trend suggests that supply shocks created by halving events lead to increased scarcity and, consequently, higher prices, assuming demand remains strong or increases. Investors often front-run this event, driving up the Bitcoin price in the months leading up to it. Growing Retail Interest: Beyond institutional money, renewed interest from retail investors is also contributing to the upward momentum. As the price climbs, media attention intensifies, drawing in new participants driven by a fear of missing out (FOMO) and the allure of significant returns. User-friendly platforms and increased accessibility have lowered the barrier to entry for individual investors. Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including improvements in scalability, security, and broader adoption of the Lightning Network for faster transactions, enhances Bitcoin’s utility and appeal. A robust and evolving network reinforces confidence in its long-term viability. A Historical Perspective: Understanding the Bitcoin Price Journey To truly appreciate the current surge, it’s essential to place the Bitcoin price within its historical context. Bitcoin’s journey has been marked by dramatic peaks and valleys, each cycle teaching valuable lessons about market dynamics and investor psychology. This latest move above $119,000 is not an isolated incident but part of a larger, evolving narrative of adoption and maturation. The Early Days and First Rallies: From its humble beginnings, Bitcoin’s price first gained significant attention in 2013, reaching hundreds of dollars before experiencing its first major correction. These early cycles established its volatile nature but also demonstrated its incredible recovery potential. The 2017 Mania: The year 2017 saw Bitcoin explode into mainstream consciousness, surging from under $1,000 at the start of the year to nearly $20,000 by December. This bull run was largely fueled by retail speculation and introduced cryptocurrency to a global audience. Following this peak, Bitcoin entered a prolonged bear market, often referred to as a ‘crypto winter.’ The 2021 Bull Run: After recovering from the 2018-2020 slump, Bitcoin embarked on another historic rally in 2020-2021, driven significantly by institutional adoption and the macroeconomic environment following global pandemic responses. The Bitcoin price reached new all-time highs, su"
2025-07-24 01:00:02+00:00,"Bitcoin Flow Pulse Breaks From 2017, 2021 Patterns – What It Means For The Rally","As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade near its all-time high (ATH) of $123,218, concerns over rising exchange deposits are mounting. However, fresh on-chain data reveals a significant contrast between the current rally and previous ones – most notably, a decline in BTC deposits to exchanges. Bitcoin Flow Pulse Shows Low Exchange Activity According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Arab Chain, the Bitcoin Inter-Exchange Flow Pulse (IFP) indicator is exhibiting “interesting behavior” in mid-2025. Notably, large investors do not appear to be selling their holdings, despite BTC trading at record highs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserves On Exchanges Hit Highest Level Since June 25 – Is BTC In Danger? Typically, sophisticated investors begin profit-taking as an asset approaches ATH territory. However, that behavior appears to be largely absent this time. The lack of selling activity stands in contrast to the market peaks of 2017 and 2021. During both these instances, there were large BTC inflows to exchanges, which were closely followed by significant price corrections. Arab Chain shared the following chart highlighting the relationship between a rising IFP and Bitcoin’s price trajectory. The chart illustrates how price corrections followed rising IFP levels at the end of 2017 and again in 2021. In 2025, despite an IFP surge earlier in the year, the BTC market has since consolidated rather than corrected. For context, the IFP indicator tracks the volume of Bitcoin transferred between centralized exchanges, providing insights into investor sentiment and market conditions. A rising IFP typically suggests growing intent to sell or arbitrage, while a declining IFP indicates reduced exchange activity and stronger holder conviction. This year’s dynamic between IFP and BTC price suggests investors are choosing to hold Bitcoin, even as prices hover near record highs. Arab Chain noted that such behavior reinforces the bullish case. They said: This behavior indicates high confidence in the uptrend so far and partly explains why the price has continued to rise without any clear selling pressure. On the other hand, if the Bitcoin IFP indicator begins to rise, it indicates an intention to sell and an anticipated significant supply pressure. Therefore, a sudden rise in the indicator is a strong warning sign for speculators. BTC Miners Engaging In Profit-Taking While large investors remain largely inactive on the selling front, Bitcoin miners appear to be cashing in on the current rally. Miner outflows surged to 16,000 BTC on July 15 – the highest single-day level since April 7.

2025-07-24 01:00:24+00:00,Crypto Laundering: South Korea Uncovers Massive $3.2M Voice Phishing Scam Ring,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Laundering: South Korea Uncovers Massive $3.2M Voice Phishing Scam Ring In a significant victory against digital crime, South Korean authorities have recently dismantled a sophisticated crypto laundering operation linked to a massive voice phishing scam. This development serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threats lurking in the digital financial landscape and the urgent need for vigilance when interacting with digital assets. The bust highlights how criminals are increasingly leveraging cryptocurrencies to obscure illicit gains, posing complex challenges for law enforcement agencies worldwide. What Exactly Happened in This Crypto Laundering Bust? The recent crackdown by the Daegu Metropolitan Police in South Korea has brought to light a substantial criminal enterprise. On July 24, authorities announced the apprehension of 28 suspects, with 16 individuals formally detained, including the alleged ringleader, a man in his 30s. This group stands accused of orchestrating a complex scheme that converted approximately 4.4 billion won, equivalent to about $3.2 million, into various cryptocurrencies. These digital assets were then systematically transferred to overseas exchanges between January and April of the current year, making it incredibly difficult to trace the illicit funds. The core of their operation involved: Voice Phishing: Deceiving victims into revealing personal information or transferring money under false pretenses, often by impersonating legitimate institutions or individuals. Rapid Conversion: Quickly converting the fraudulently obtained fiat currency into cryptocurrencies to exploit the speed and cross-border nature of digital transactions. International Transfers: Moving these digital assets across international borders through various exchanges, adding layers of complexity to the money trail and hindering recovery efforts by local authorities. This incident underscores a growing trend where traditional scams are increasingly intertwined with advanced digital financial tools, posing a formidable challenge for law enforcement agencies globally. The swift action by the South Korean police demonstrates a heightened capability and determination to combat these evolving forms of financial crime. How Does Voice Phishing Lead to Crypto Laundering? Voice phishing, or ‘vishing,’ is a deceptive tactic where criminals use phone calls to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that lead to financial loss. When combined with crypto laundering , the process becomes even more insidious and difficult to track. Here’s a breakdown of how these two illicit activities often converge: Initial Deception: Scammers make unsolicited calls, often impersonating bank officials, government agents, or tech support. They create a sense of urgency or fear, coercing victims into believing their accounts are compromised or they owe money. Fraudulent Fund Transfer: Victims, under duress or false pretenses, are convinced to transfer money from their bank accounts. This money might be sent directly to a mule account controlled by the criminals or, increasingly, victims are instructed to deposit cash into specific accounts or even purchase gift cards. Conversion to Crypto: Once the fiat currency is obtained, the criminals quickly convert it into cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), or stablecoins (USDT, USDC). This step is crucial for money launderers because digital assets offer several advantages: Speed: Crypto transactions can be processed much faster than traditional bank transfers, allowing criminals to move funds before they can be flagged or frozen. Global Reach: Cryptocurrencies can be sent anywhere in the world instantly, bypassing geographical restrictions and traditional financial regulations. Perceived Anonymity: While not truly anonymous, crypto transactions can be pseudonymous, making it harder to link transactions directly to real-world identities, especially when funds are moved through multiple wallets and mixing services. Layering and Integration: The converted crypto is then moved through a series of transactions, often across multiple exchanges, wallets, and sometimes even through decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or mixers, to obscure the origin of the funds. Finally, the laundered crypto is ‘integrated’ back into the legitimate financial system, perhaps by cashing out into fiat currency in another country or using it to purchase high-value assets. The speed and global nature of cryptocurrency transactions make them a preferred tool for criminals looking to quickly move and obfuscate their ill-gotten gains from voice phishing scams, creating a complex web that challenges even the most sophisticated investigative units.

According to a document dated July 22, 2025, the decision was first issued by the SEC''s Division of Trading and Markets. However, Assistant Secretary Sherry R. Haywood later announced that the matter would be reviewed by the full Commission. In its official notice , a representative of the SEC cited Rule 431, which allows the agency to suspend a decision until further notice pending a full review. The SEC declined to comment on the ongoing review, citing agency policy. Bitwise also did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Bitwise 10 fund, which trades under the ticker BITW, consists of cryptocurrencies weighted by market capitalization, including major assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Polkadot. Previously, the fund was available only over-the-counter. The move to transform it into an ETF was widely anticipated, as requests for crypto fund conversions have increased in recent months. A similar episode happened with the Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund. Its application to convert into an ETF also initially received accelerated approval, which the SEC later put on hold. Grayscale continues to press for listing, indicating it is prepared to pursue further legal avenues if necessary. The SEC has not yet officially commented on the reasons for these suspensions, but analysts have proposed several theories. Van Buren Capital General Partner Scott Johnson suggests the initial approval may have been issued to facilitate further review or intervention by Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, who is known for her skepticism toward cryptocurrencies.

Asymmetric, a well-known name in the digital asset space, has announced the winding down of its Liquid Alpha Fund. This significant decision comes after a period of intense scrutiny and substantial financial setbacks, prompting founder Joe McCann to declare a strategic shift towards long-term investments in blockchain infrastructure. What does this mean for the future of crypto investment strategies, and what can we learn from this high-profile development? Why is a Crypto Investment Firm Winding Down Its Liquid Alpha Fund? The core reason behind Asymmetric’s decision to close its Liquid Alpha Fund stems from its inability to effectively navigate the current market conditions with its liquid-trading strategy. CoinDesk reported on the firm’s significant losses throughout the year, leading to widespread criticism and allegations that underscored the fund’s underperformance. Joe McCann, the founder of Asymmetric, openly addressed these challenges in an X post, acknowledging that the very strategy designed for agile market participation was no longer yielding desired results. Liquid trading, by its nature, relies on rapid execution and profiting from short-term price movements in highly liquid assets. While this approach can be lucrative during bull markets or periods of clear trends, it becomes incredibly challenging and capital-intensive during prolonged periods of market consolidation, increased regulatory uncertainty, or unexpected macroeconomic shifts. For a crypto investment firm specializing in this area, sustained losses can quickly erode investor confidence and capital, making the continuation of such a fund untenable. The decision to wind down, while painful, is often a necessary step to protect remaining assets and reassess strategic direction. It reflects a candid admission that the prevailing market environment has fundamentally altered the viability of their previous approach, necessitating a complete re-evaluation of how a firm can best generate returns in the dynamic crypto landscape. The Volatility of Liquid Trading Strategies: A Closer Look The challenges faced by Asymmetric’s Liquid Alpha Fund highlight a crucial aspect of the cryptocurrency market: its inherent volatility and the specific risks associated with liquid trading strategies. Unlike traditional markets, crypto assets can experience extreme price swings within hours, influenced by a myriad of factors from regulatory news and technological advancements to social media sentiment and broader economic indicators. For a crypto investment firm engaged in liquid trading, this volatility presents both immense opportunity and significant peril. Consider these key aspects that often impact such strategies: Market Depth and Liquidity: While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum boast high liquidity, smaller altcoins can have thinner order books, making large trades difficult without impacting price. Sudden, large orders can lead to significant slippage, eroding potential profits. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape globally introduces unpredictable elements. Announcements about new regulations, bans, or enforcement actions can trigger immediate and drastic price reactions, catching even the most sophisticated liquid trading algorithms off guard. Black Swan Events: The crypto market has seen its share of unexpected collapses, such as the implosion of Terra-Luna or FTX. These “black swan” events can decimate portfolios engaged in liquid strategies, as assets become illiquid or lose value almost instantaneously, leading to steep losses that are difficult to mitigate. High Frequency and Algorithmic Trading: The space is increasingly dominated by high-frequency trading (HFT) firms and advanced algorithms. Competing in this environment requires significant technological infrastructure, speed, and deep market insights, often making it a zero-sum game where only the most sophisticated players thrive. Asymmetric’s experience underscores that even with expertise, a liquid trading strategy in crypto demands constant adaptation and a robust risk management framework. When market conditions shift unfavorably for an extended period, even a leading crypto investment firm might find its liquid alpha strategy struggling to deliver. Shifting Gears: Asymmetric’s New Focus on Blockchain Infrastructure In response to the challenges faced by its Liquid Alpha Fund, Asymmetric is embarking on a significant strategic pivot, shifting its focus towards long-term investments in blockchain infrastructure.

2025-07-24 02:00:37+00:00,PENGU Heats Up: Nearly $600M In Open Interest Sparks Rally Talk,"PENGU is finally getting serious consideration this week, with indications of strength straight out of the derivatives market. Open interest has spiked to $591 million, while overall derivatives volume detonated to more than $4.43 billion. That’s a 35% jump in open interest and a massive 291% spike in volume, based on data from Coinglass. Related Reading: PEPE Sparks Google Frenzy With 300% Surge In Search Interest This kind of sharp increase in activity suggests traders are becoming more aggressive. Many are either betting on higher prices or preparing for big moves in both directions. For now, the momentum favors the bulls. Strong Price Holds Support As Traders Build Positions Price-wise, PENGU has been steady above $0.036 after reclaiming the key $0.033 level. It’s currently trading at $0.041. Its relative strength index is sitting at 64.04—well above neutral, but not yet in overbought territory. That’s a good sign for bulls hoping for more upside without triggering a correction too soon. Volume Spikes Add Fuel To Momentum Traders are now watching the $0.038 level closely. That’s just below the Fibonacci 1.618 extension, which sits at $0.03846. If PENGU manages to break above it, more traders could jump in, especially with the derivatives side already heating up. More than 38 million PENGU tokens were exchanged in the past 24 hours, underpinning the strength of the move. The bullish configuration is also aided by support levels near the 0.786 Fib, 0.618, and 0.5 regions. These are areas where buyers have intervened in the past, and they might do the same if prices retract. There are no signs of bearish divergence on the RSI, and each dip has been followed by quick recoveries. That keeps the overall trend in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Too Pricey?

PENGU is finally getting serious consideration this week, with indications of strength straight out of the derivatives market. Open interest has spiked to $591 million, while overall derivatives volume detonated to more than $4.43 billion. That’s a 35% jump in open interest and a massive 291% spike in volume, based on data from Coinglass.

Many are either betting on higher prices or preparing for big moves in both directions. For now, the momentum favors the bulls. Strong Price Holds Support As Traders Build Positions Price-wise, PENGU has been steady above $0.036 after reclaiming the key $0.033 level. It’s currently trading at $0.041. Its relative strength index is sitting at 64.04—well above neutral, but not yet in overbought territory. That’s a good sign for bulls hoping for more upside without triggering a correction too soon. Volume Spikes Add Fuel To Momentum Traders are now watching the $0.038 level closely. That’s just below the Fibonacci 1.618 extension, which sits at $0.03846. If PENGU manages to break above it, more traders could jump in, especially with the derivatives side already heating up. More than 38 million PENGU tokens were exchanged in the past 24 hours, underpinning the strength of the move. The bullish configuration is also aided by support levels near the 0.786 Fib, 0.618, and 0.5 regions. These are areas where buyers have intervened in the past, and they might do the same if prices retract. There are no signs of bearish divergence on the RSI, and each dip has been followed by quick recoveries. That keeps the overall trend in favor of the bulls. Related Reading: Too Pricey? Expert Says XRP Beats Bitcoin And Ethereum Right Now PENGU Open Interest Up Open interest increasing along with price generally indicates that traders are supporting the move with conviction. But this also makes the market more prone to sudden changes. With $591 million invested in open positions, even a minor pullback could cause a mass of exits. That’s the danger when too much money rushes in too fast. $PENGU break-out/retest pic.twitter.com/EVJaryQzzs — Muro (@MuroCrypto) July 22, 2025 Another Move Upward?

2025-07-24 02:00:44+00:00,Analyst Sounds Alarm For 50% Crash If Bitcoin Doesn’t Make A New ATH Soon,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be on the edge of a significant market move, as a crypto analyst warns that failure to reach an all-time high in the coming weeks could trigger a sharp correction. While long-term bullish sentiment remains strong, the immediate outlook hinges on whether BTC can maintain an upward momentum and avoid a damaging setback that could derail or further stall its current rally. Bitcoin Faces 50% Crash Threat A prominent crypto analyst, Tony Severino, has issued a stark warning to Bitcoin investors on X social media. He cautions that a failure to break a new all-time high soon could spark a massive price crash —potentially wiping out over 50% of BTC’s current value. In his shared Elliott Wave chart analysis , Severino highlights Bitcoin’s current position within what appears to be an intermediate Wave 4 Expanded Flat correction. According to the structure, Bitcoin may be nearing the end of wave B, which typically precedes a steep drop in wave C. Severino’s analysis draws parallels between BTC’s current price behavior and the 2021-2022 expanded flat correction that defined Primary Wave 4. At the time, Bitcoin peaked in wave B before cascading into wave C, resulting in a brutal bear market . A similar pattern appears to be developing in BTC’s current chart structure. The chart highlights that the recent surge in the cryptocurrency’s price could be forming a deceptive wave B peak, which may soon reverse into a wave C crash targeting the $60,000 region or lower. A decline to this level would represent a 50% drawdown from current levels, near $118,000. Notably, Severino’s warning does not stem from a bearish conviction but rather from cautious optimism. While he maintains a strong bullish long-term outlook and believes Bitcoin still has a final Wave 5 rally ahead , the analyst emphasizes the need for BTC to break out into a new ATH soon to invalidate the expanded flat scenario. Should the market fail to deliver this upside move, the corrective structure could dominate and significantly delay the next upward impulse leg. A potential crash could also severely disrupt the long-anticipated altcoin season , stalling momentum across the broader crypto market. Analyst Sets Bitcoin’s Next ATH Target Bitcoin has ignited fresh optimism over the past week following its latest price surge above $123,000 . Despite pulling back to its current price above $118,000, a market expert identified as ‘The Crypto Professor’ on X predicts that the flagship cryptocurrency is gearing up for a fresh all-time high. The Crypto Professor has set Bitcoin’s next ATH target at $129,948, coinciding with the 1.618 Fibonacci Extension level. With BTC now trading at $118,612, this would represent a solid 9.6% price gain. Notably, the analyst’s chart shows previous consolidation zones around the $110,000 and $100,000 region, matching the Fibonacci Retracement levels of 1 and 0.786. These levels now serve as potential support zones in the event of a retest.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/a-50-crash-for-bitcoin/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO,Bitcoin|Altcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Crypto Professor|Elliot Wave Theory|Fibonacci Extension Level|Tony Severino,BTC,"Analyst Sounds Alarm For 50% Crash If Bitcoin Doesn’t Make A New ATH Soon.

2025-07-24 02:25:23+00:00,Spot Bitcoin ETF: Fidelity’s Crucial Move Unlocking In-Kind Redemptions,"BitcoinWorld Spot Bitcoin ETF: Fidelity’s Crucial Move Unlocking In-Kind Redemptions The world of cryptocurrency investment is constantly evolving, and a recent development from asset management giant Fidelity is creating significant buzz. If you’ve been following the journey of the Spot Bitcoin ETF , you know the excitement and challenges involved. Now, Fidelity is making a bold move, seeking U.S. SEC approval to amend its existing Spot Bitcoin ETF filing to allow for ‘in-kind’ redemptions and creations. This isn’t just a technical tweak; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine how investors interact with Bitcoin through traditional financial vehicles. What Exactly Are In-Kind Redemptions, and Why Do They Matter for Your Spot Bitcoin ETF Investment? To truly grasp the significance of Fidelity’s filing, we first need to understand what ‘in-kind’ redemptions mean, especially in the context of a Spot Bitcoin ETF . Traditionally, many ETFs, particularly those involving less liquid assets or those with regulatory sensitivities, operate on a ‘cash’ redemption model. This means that when an authorized participant (AP) wants to redeem ETF shares, the issuer sells the underlying assets (in this case, Bitcoin) and gives the AP cash in return. Similarly, for creations, the AP provides cash, and the issuer buys the underlying assets. However, ‘in-kind’ redemptions are different. They allow authorized participants to exchange ETF shares directly for the underlying assets themselves – meaning Bitcoin, in the case of a Spot Bitcoin ETF . Conversely, for creations, APs would deliver Bitcoin directly to the ETF issuer in exchange for new shares. This fundamental shift is particularly significant for a Spot Bitcoin ETF , where the underlying asset is a volatile digital currency. It streamlines the process and introduces several potential advantages for investors and the market alike. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Cash Redemption Model In-Kind Redemption Model Underlying Asset Exchange Sold for cash by issuer; AP receives cash. Direct exchange of Bitcoin for shares; AP receives Bitcoin. Tax Implications Potential for capital gains events for the ETF. Generally more tax-efficient for the ETF structure. Operational Complexity Requires cash management and market execution by issuer. Requires secure digital asset custody and transfer. Market Impact Issuer’s buying/selling can influence market price. Direct exchange can reduce market impact. Why is Fidelity Championing This Change for the Spot Bitcoin ETF Landscape? Fidelity, a financial powerhouse with decades of experience in asset management, has long been an advocate for Bitcoin and digital assets. Their pursuit of in-kind redemptions for their Spot Bitcoin ETF is not arbitrary. It stems from a deep understanding of market mechanics and a desire to offer the most efficient and beneficial investment vehicles to their clients. By pushing for this model, Fidelity aims to: Enhance Tax Efficiency: In-kind redemptions can often be more tax-efficient for the ETF structure itself. When an ETF sells assets for cash to meet redemptions, it can trigger capital gains taxes within the fund, which are then passed on to investors. In-kind redemptions, by directly exchanging assets, can potentially avoid these taxable events, leading to better after-tax returns for investors. Improve Operational Efficiency: Direct exchange of Bitcoin for shares can simplify the operational process for both the issuer and authorized participants, reducing the need for complex cash management and market timing for large transactions. Reduce Trading Spreads: With a more efficient creation and redemption mechanism, the ETF’s price is likely to track the underlying Bitcoin price more closely, potentially leading to tighter spreads for investors. Align with Traditional ETF Best Practices: Many established commodity ETFs (like gold or silver ETFs) operate on an in-kind model. Fidelity’s move seeks to align the Spot Bitcoin ETF with these proven structures, lending it more credibility in the eyes of traditional finance investors and regulators. Their commitment underscores a belief in the long-term viability and mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, especially through a robust Spot Bitcoin ETF structure. The SEC’s Evolving Stance: A Key Factor for Spot Bitcoin ETF Progress The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has historically been cautious, even skeptical, about approving a Spot Bitcoin ETF . Concerns primarily revolved around market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. However, the landscape has significantly shifted. The approval of several cash-settled Spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a monumental turning point, signaling a growing, albeit cautious, comfort level within the regulatory body regarding the mechanisms surrounding a Spot Bitcoin ETF .

2025-07-24 02:40:23+00:00,Groundbreaking: 21Shares and Societe Generale Forge Strategic Alliance for Crypto ETPs,"BitcoinWorld Groundbreaking: 21Shares and Societe Generale Forge Strategic Alliance for Crypto ETPs Imagine a financial landscape where the innovative spirit of digital assets seamlessly integrates with the robust infrastructure of traditional banking. This vision is rapidly becoming a reality, and a recent announcement from 21Shares, a leading global issuer of cryptocurrency Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), and French banking giant Societe Generale, marks a truly pivotal moment for Crypto ETPs . This strategic collaboration is not just another headline; it’s a testament to the growing maturity and institutional acceptance of digital assets, promising to reshape how investors access the burgeoning crypto market. According to a press release on GlobeNewswire , 21Shares has officially signed an ETP market-making fund platform agreement with Societe Generale. This landmark deal positions the venerable French bank to provide crucial over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity for 21Shares’ Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs across major fund platforms in Germany and Eastern Europe. For anyone watching the convergence of traditional finance and the crypto world, this development signals a significant leap forward, particularly for the accessibility and stability of Crypto ETPs in key European markets. What Does This Groundbreaking Partnership Mean for Crypto ETPs? The collaboration between 21Shares and Societe Generale is far more than a simple business transaction; it represents a profound shift in the perception and practical application of digital assets within mainstream finance. For investors, especially institutions, direct exposure to cryptocurrencies can be fraught with complexities, including custody, security, and regulatory uncertainties. This is precisely where Crypto ETPs shine. Crypto ETPs are financial instruments that track the price of underlying cryptocurrencies, allowing investors to gain exposure without directly owning the digital assets. They trade on regulated stock exchanges, offering a familiar and compliant pathway for traditional investors. This partnership enhances several key aspects: Enhanced Accessibility: By leveraging Societe Generale’s extensive network and market-making capabilities, 21Shares’ Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs become more readily available to a broader range of investors, particularly institutional clients in Germany and Eastern Europe. Increased Trust and Credibility: The involvement of a banking giant like Societe Generale lends significant credibility to the crypto asset class. It signals to a wider audience that digital assets are maturing and are being integrated into established financial frameworks. Regulatory Comfort: ETPs operate within regulated environments, providing a level of investor protection and oversight that direct crypto investments often lack. Societe Generale’s involvement further solidifies this regulatory comfort. 21Shares has been at the forefront of the Crypto ETPs space, consistently innovating and expanding its product suite. Their expertise in structuring and managing these products, combined with Societe Generale’s deep financial market experience, creates a powerful synergy poised to drive further adoption. How Does Societe Generale Enhance Liquidity for Bitcoin and Ethereum ETPs? Liquidity is the lifeblood of any financial market. It refers to the ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its market price. In nascent markets like cryptocurrency, liquidity can sometimes be a concern, leading to wider bid-ask spreads and higher transaction costs. Societe Generale’s role as a market-making fund platform is designed to address this directly for 21Shares’ Crypto ETPs . A market maker facilitates trading by constantly offering both buy and sell prices for an asset. By doing so, they ensure there’s always a counterparty for trades, making it easier for investors to enter or exit positions. Societe Generale will provide over-the-counter (OTC) liquidity, which is particularly significant for several reasons: Direct, Private Transactions: OTC trading involves direct deals between two parties, bypassing public exchanges. This is crucial for large institutional trades, as it allows for significant volumes to be executed without causing large price swings on public order books. Reduced Price Impact: Large orders placed on public exchanges can sometimes move the market against the trader. OTC desks mitigate this by absorbing large trades discreetly. Tighter Spreads: With a major player like Societe Generale actively making markets, the difference between the buy and sell price (the spread) for Bitcoin ETPs and Ethereum ETPs is likely to narrow, leading to more efficient trading for investors. Deeper Order Books: Societe Generale’s commitment adds significant depth to the available liquidity, ensuring that even substantial trades can be executed smoothly and reliably.

2025-07-24 02:56:48+00:00,Bitcoin Price Aims Fresh Gains After Consolidation: Can the Rally Resume?,"Bitcoin price is eyeing a fresh increase above the $118,500 resistance. BTC must clear the $120,250 resistance zone to gain bullish momentum in the near term. Bitcoin started a fresh increase after it cleared the $118,000 zone. The price is trading above $118,600 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $118,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might start another increase if it clears the $120,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Aims Another Increase Bitcoin price started a correction phase from the $120,250 resistance zone. BTC dipped below the $118,500 level and tested the $118,000 zone. There was a move below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $116,260 swing low to the $120,237 high. However, the bulls were active near the $117,500 support zone. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $118,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading above $118,600 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $119,300 level. The first key resistance is near the $120,000 level. The next resistance could be $120,250. A close above the $120,250 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $122,500 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $122,500 level. The main target could be $123,200. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $120,250 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $118,500 level and the trend line.

2025-07-24 03:10:23+00:00,Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Shocking 24-Hour Wipeout,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Shocking 24-Hour Wipeout In the fast-paced and often unpredictable world of cryptocurrencies, significant price movements can lead to dramatic consequences for traders, especially those engaged in leveraged trading. Over the last 24 hours, the crypto market witnessed substantial crypto perpetual futures liquidation events, sending ripples across major digital assets. This isn’t just a technical term; it represents real money, real risk, and real lessons for anyone involved in crypto trading. Let’s dive deep into what transpired and what it means for the market. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Before we dissect the recent data, it’s crucial to understand what crypto perpetual futures liquidation entails. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, hence the term ‘perpetual’. However, these contracts often involve significant leverage, meaning traders can open positions much larger than their initial capital. While leverage amplifies potential profits, it also magnifies potential losses. Liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement set by the exchange. This typically happens due to adverse price movements against their leveraged position. To prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange, the position is automatically closed, or ‘liquidated’. Think of it like this: you borrow money to make a big bet on a crypto’s price going up (a ‘long’ position). If the price suddenly drops significantly, the value of your collateral might not be enough to cover the potential losses. The exchange then steps in, automatically selling your position to cut losses before your account goes into negative equity. This automatic closing of a leveraged position is the essence of crypto perpetual futures liquidation . Diving Deep into the 24-Hour Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Data The past 24 hours have been particularly volatile, leading to substantial liquidations across key cryptocurrencies. The data reveals a clear dominance of ‘long’ liquidations, indicating that a majority of traders were betting on price increases, only to be caught off guard by a downward price swing. Here’s a detailed breakdown: Ethereum (ETH): $149.83 million liquidated, with 85.35% being Long positions. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, bore the brunt of the liquidations. Nearly $150 million in ETH futures positions were wiped out. The overwhelming majority (over 85%) were long positions, meaning traders expected ETH’s price to rise. When the price moved contrary to their expectations, these highly leveraged bets were quickly closed out by exchanges. This significant figure highlights the aggressive long positioning many traders had taken on ETH, potentially anticipating a breakout that did not materialize. Bitcoin (BTC): $67.37 million liquidated, with 77.18% being Long positions. Bitcoin, the flagship cryptocurrency, also saw considerable liquidations, albeit less than Ethereum. Over $67 million in BTC futures positions were liquidated, with more than three-quarters of these being long positions. This suggests that while there was strong bullish sentiment for Bitcoin, a market correction or consolidation phase led to these positions being unwound. Bitcoin’s movements often dictate the broader market sentiment, and its liquidations can have a cascading effect. Solana (SOL): $41.61 million liquidated, with 92.18% being Long positions. Solana, a high-performance blockchain, experienced one of the highest percentages of long liquidations. Over $41 million in SOL futures were liquidated, with an astounding 92.18% being long positions. This indicates an extremely strong bullish bias among SOL traders that was severely punished by recent price action. Such a high percentage suggests that many traders were perhaps over-leveraged on SOL, making their positions highly susceptible to even minor price fluctuations. The common thread across all three major assets is the dominance of long liquidations. This pattern often emerges after periods of sustained bullish sentiment or when prices hit resistance levels, leading to profit-taking or short-selling pressure that catches overly optimistic long traders off guard. Why Do Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidations Happen So Frequently? Understanding the ‘why’ behind these frequent crypto perpetual futures liquidation events is crucial for any trader. Several factors contribute to the high frequency and magnitude of liquidations in the crypto market: High Leverage: Crypto exchanges often offer extremely high leverage ratios (e.g., 50x, 100x, or even more). While appealing for potential gains, this means even a small percentage move against a position can lead t",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-futures-liquidation-breakdown-3/,TRADING|MARKET|ZRX|SOL|BTC,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Crypto Futures|ETHEREUM|Liquidation.|Solana,BTC,"Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Shocking 24-Hour Wipeout.

2025-07-24 03:25:23+00:00,Bithumb Unveils Exciting New Listings: LISTA and MERL Spot Pairs Arrive July 24,"BitcoinWorld Bithumb Unveils Exciting New Listings: LISTA and MERL Spot Pairs Arrive July 24 The cryptocurrency world is constantly buzzing with new developments, and one of the most anticipated events for any digital asset is a listing on a major exchange. South Korean crypto giant Bithumb has just dropped exciting news, announcing the upcoming Bithumb listing of two new spot trading pairs: LISTA/KRW and MERL/KRW. This move, set for July 24, promises to open new avenues for traders and significantly boost the visibility and liquidity of both LISTA and MERL tokens. What’s the Buzz Around Bithumb’s Latest Listing? Bithumb, one of South Korea’s largest and most reputable cryptocurrency exchanges, confirmed on its official website that it will be adding LISTA and MERL to its growing roster of supported assets. The new spot trading pairs, LISTA/KRW and MERL/KRW, are scheduled to go live on July 24, 2024. Specifically, LISTA/KRW trading will commence at 07:00 UTC, followed by MERL/KRW at 09:00 UTC. This announcement marks a significant milestone for both projects and provides Bithumb users with fresh opportunities for diversification and engagement. For those unfamiliar, a spot trading pair allows users to directly exchange one cryptocurrency for another at the current market price. In this case, users will be able to trade LISTA directly against the Korean Won (KRW) and MERL directly against the Korean Won, simplifying access for South Korean investors and potentially attracting a wider international audience to these tokens. Diving Deeper into LISTA: What Does This Listing Mean? LISTA (Lista DAO) is a decentralized liquidity protocol that focuses on Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSDfi) and stablecoin issuance. It allows users to stake their crypto assets, receive liquid staking tokens, and then use these tokens as collateral to borrow lisUSD, a decentralized stablecoin. The protocol aims to provide a robust and capital-efficient solution for users looking to earn yields while maintaining liquidity. The LISTA Bithumb listing is particularly impactful for several reasons: Increased Accessibility: Listing on a major fiat-to-crypto gateway like Bithumb makes LISTA directly accessible to a large pool of South Korean investors who prefer to trade with KRW. This eliminates the need for multiple conversions, reducing friction and costs. Enhanced Liquidity: Greater accessibility typically translates to higher trading volumes and deeper liquidity, which is crucial for price stability and efficient trading. Global Exposure: While Bithumb primarily serves the South Korean market, its status as a top-tier exchange lends significant credibility and global visibility to LISTA, potentially attracting interest from international traders and institutions. Validation: A listing on a regulated exchange like Bithumb often serves as a form of validation for a project’s legitimacy and potential, especially given South Korea’s strict regulatory environment. This strategic move by Bithumb could significantly propel LISTA’s adoption and integration within the broader DeFi ecosystem, especially in the Asian market. Exploring MERL: The Potential Impact of its Bithumb Listing MERL (Merlin Chain) is an innovative Bitcoin Layer 2 solution designed to bring greater scalability, efficiency, and smart contract capabilities to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It aims to address Bitcoin’s inherent limitations in transaction speed and cost, enabling a wider range of decentralized applications (dApps) and functionalities directly on top of Bitcoin’s robust security framework. Merlin Chain utilizes technologies like ZK-Rollups and decentralized oracles to achieve its goals. The MERL Bithumb listing is equally significant, particularly for the burgeoning Bitcoin Layer 2 narrative: Pioneering Bitcoin L2 Access: Bithumb’s decision to list MERL highlights the growing interest and investment in Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions. It provides a direct on-ramp for South Korean investors to participate in this cutting-edge segment of the crypto market. Boosting Ecosystem Growth: By increasing MERL’s liquidity and reach, the listing can further stimulate development and adoption within the Merlin Chain ecosystem, encouraging more developers and users to build on or utilize its platform. Strategic Market Entry: South Korea is a key market for crypto innovation and adoption. Gaining a foothold through Bithumb positions MERL strongly within this influential region, potentially setting a precedent for other Bitcoin L2 projects. Diversification for Traders: For Bithumb users, MERL offers a unique opportunity to invest in a project that aims to expand Bitcoin’s utility, providing a distinct investment profile compared to typical altcoins. The listing of MERL on Bithumb underscores the exchange’s commitment to offering diverse and innovative assets, particularly those at the forefront of blockchain technology.

2025-07-24 03:30:13+00:00,"Ethereum Ready For $3,800 Reclaim Despite Rejection – Third Time’s The Charm?","Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim its most critical resistance after registering a nearly 70% rally in the past month. Some crypto analysts suggest that the King of Altcoins is preparing to aim for new highs, but warned a potential pullback might come first. Related Reading: PENGU Leads Top Memecoin List Amid 20% Daily Surge – What’s Behind The Rally? Ethereum Risks 15% Correction Ethereum started the week hitting a yearly high and recording a 178% recovery from the April lows. The cryptocurrency has seen a significant rally over the past few weeks, following its price breakout and consolidation between May and June. As the crypto market started to soar again this month, driven by Bitcoin’s climb to new all-time highs (ATHs), ETH reclaimed the crucial $3,000 barrier and has continued to rise to its most critical resistance around the $3,800 area. On Monday, Ethereum reached its yearly high of $3,860 before being rejected and retracing to the $3,600 area. Following this performance, analyst Ali Martinez suggested that the $3,835 resistance and the $3,490 support will likely determine Ethereum’s next move. Notably, the $3,825 area sits as the largest resistance ahead, where 2.82 million addresses have bought 1.48 million ETH. Reclaiming this level would set the stage for a rally to the cycle high of $4,107. Meanwhile, the $3,490 area, where 4.18 million addresses bought 3.53 million ETH, remains the largest support after the recent breakout. A strong rejection from the key resistance could send the price toward this area if the current levels don’t hold. Market Watcher Andrew Crypto considers that Ethereum will likely see a correction soon, as “a chart without a correction isn’t a healthy chart.” To the analyst, the cryptocurrency could be headed to its yearly opening (YO) area, between $3,300-$3,400, after being rejected from the local supply zone and major resistance. Nonetheless, he forecasted a bounce and retest of the $3,800 mark if the pullback occurs. ETH To Repeat Past Cycle’s Playbook? Analyst Crypto Bullet suggested that Ethereum’s performance resembles its price action from last cycle. According to the post, ETH’s chart is starting to form a Descending Broadening Wedge pattern, “almost identical” to its setup from 2019-2020. To the analyst, “The picture looks very bullish right now” as price is testing the pattern’s resistance for the third time.

Crypto Bullet warned that a 10%-15% pullback to the $3,300-$3,400 area could come first, but added that “If we do break this formidable Resistance, ETH will rally hard. In this case, a new ATH is guaranteed.” Similarly, Merlijn The Trader highlighted the similarities between Ethereum’s rally in 2017 and 2025, as the King of Altcoin shows the “Same range. Same fakeout.

Ethereum (ETH) is attempting to reclaim its most critical resistance after registering a nearly 70% rally in the past month. Some crypto analysts suggest that the King of Altcoins is preparing to aim for new highs, but warned a potential pullback might come first. Related Reading: PENGU Leads Top Memecoin List Amid 20% Daily Surge – What’s Behind The Rally? Ethereum Risks 15% Correction Ethereum started the week hitting a yearly high and recording a 178% recovery from the April lows. The cryptocurrency has seen a significant rally over the past few weeks, following its price breakout and consolidation between May and June. As the crypto market started to soar again this month, driven by Bitcoin’s climb to new all-time highs (ATHs), ETH reclaimed the crucial $3,000 barrier and has continued to rise to its most critical resistance around the $3,800 area. On Monday, Ethereum reached its yearly high of $3,860 before being rejected and retracing to the $3,600 area. Following this performance, analyst Ali Martinez suggested that the $3,835 resistance and the $3,490 support will likely determine Ethereum’s next move. Notably, the $3,825 area sits as the largest resistance ahead, where 2.82 million addresses have bought 1.48 million ETH. Reclaiming this level would set the stage for a rally to the cycle high of $4,107. Meanwhile, the $3,490 area, where 4.18 million addresses bought 3.53 million ETH, remains the largest support after the recent breakout. A strong rejection from the key resistance could send the price toward this area if the current levels don’t hold. Market Watcher Andrew Crypto considers that Ethereum will likely see a correction soon, as “a chart without a correction isn’t a healthy chart.” To the analyst, the cryptocurrency could be headed to its yearly opening (YO) area, between $3,300-$3,400, after being rejected from the local supply zone and major resistance. Nonetheless, he forecasted a bounce and retest of the $3,800 mark if the pullback occurs. ETH To Repeat Past Cycle’s Playbook? Analyst Crypto Bullet suggested that Ethereum’s performance resembles its price action from last cycle. According to the post, ETH’s chart is starting to form a Descending Broadening Wedge pattern, “almost identical” to its setup from 2019-2020. To the analyst, “The picture looks very bullish right now” as price is testing the pattern’s resistance for the third time. He believes it will break out this time, similar to what happened in 2020, and eyes a cycle top target between $8,000 and $10,000.

These investment vehicles, heralded as a bridge between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto world, offer a transparent window into institutional and retail investor sentiment. On July 23, the crypto sphere witnessed a notable shift as these highly anticipated funds recorded a collective net outflow of $86.04 million, marking the third consecutive day of negative sentiment. What does this crucial development signify for the broader market, and why are investors seemingly adjusting their positions? This recent data, meticulously tracked and shared by prominent crypto analyst Trader T on X, has ignited discussions across trading desks and investor forums. While some funds experienced significant withdrawals, others managed to attract fresh capital, painting a complex and nuanced picture of current market dynamics. Understanding these shifts is paramount for anyone navigating the volatile yet undeniably promising realm of digital assets, particularly those looking to gauge the institutional appetite for Bitcoin ETF s. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin ETF Outflows: A Closer Look at the Numbers The headline figure of $86.04 million in net outflows on July 23 might appear modest when juxtaposed against the multi-trillion-dollar crypto market. However, its true significance lies in the trend it represents: this marked the third consecutive day of net withdrawals from U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF s. This sustained pattern suggests a potential recalibration of investor strategies or a reaction to broader market cues, moving beyond mere daily fluctuations. A deeper dive into the individual fund performances reveals a nuanced story, highlighting varying degrees of investor conviction across different providers: Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund bore the brunt of the outflows, shedding a substantial $227.24 million. This particular fund has been a strong performer and a significant recipient of inflows since its inception, making this large withdrawal particularly noteworthy and prompting questions about its underlying cause, whether it be a large institutional redemption or a broader shift in sentiment among its holders. ARK Invest’s ARKB: Following Fidelity, the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF also contributed to the overall negative tally, recording an outflow of $9.84 million. Bitwise’s BITB: The Bitwise Bitcoin ETF, another popular choice among investors, also registered a modest outflow of $1.93 million for the day. However, the picture wasn’t entirely grim. Two major players managed to buck the prevailing trend, showcasing continued investor confidence in their offerings: BlackRock’s IBIT: The iShares Bitcoin Trust, from the world’s largest asset manager, continued its impressive run, posting a net inflow of $142.48 million. BlackRock’s consistent ability to attract substantial capital underscores its strong market presence, the trust investors place in its brand, and potentially its broader distribution network reaching a diverse pool of investors. Grayscale’s mini BTC: The newly launched Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), designed as a lower-fee alternative to the original Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), saw a net inflow of $10.49 million. This suggests that while the legacy GBTC has historically seen significant outflows due to its higher fees, the new, more competitive mini version is beginning to find its footing and attract fresh capital. The remaining U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF s reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating a relatively stable position for those particular funds amidst the broader movements. The aggregate outflows, especially after a period of consistent inflows that followed the initial launch, signal a potential recalibration of portfolios or a reaction to broader market cues. This daily data, sourced from Trader T, provides timely and critical insights into institutional and retail investor behavior concerning these regulated investment products. Why Are Investors Pulling Back?

That’s precisely what’s happening with U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs . On July 23, these innovative investment vehicles experienced a remarkable combined net inflow of $332.81 million. This isn’t just a one-off success; it extends an impressive streak of positive flows to 14 consecutive trading days, signaling robust and sustained investor interest in Ethereum. This consistent influx of capital into Spot Ethereum ETFs is a powerful indicator of growing institutional confidence and broader market acceptance for digital assets. For anyone watching the cryptocurrency space, this trend is impossible to ignore, suggesting a maturing market and a new era of mainstream integration for Ethereum. What’s Fueling the Spot Ethereum ETFs Momentum? The latest data, shared by the reputable financial tracking account @thepfund on X, paints a clear picture of who’s leading this charge. BlackRock’s ETHA, one of the most anticipated entrants, dominated the landscape with an astounding $325.27 million in inflows on July 23 alone. This colossal figure highlights the immense power and reach of established financial giants stepping into the crypto arena. Following BlackRock, VanEck’s ETHV saw a respectable $3.95 million in inflows, and Fidelity’s FETH added $3.59 million to its coffers. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, emphasizing the concentration of activity among the top players. But why this sudden, sustained interest? The approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was a landmark decision, providing a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This regulatory clarity has opened the floodgates for institutional capital that was previously hesitant to enter the volatile, often unregulated, crypto markets. Here are some key drivers: Institutional Validation: The SEC’s approval legitimizes Ethereum as an asset class in the eyes of traditional finance, attracting large institutional investors, pension funds, and wealth managers. Accessibility and Familiarity: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them familiar and easy to access for investors accustomed to conventional financial products. This removes the complexities of crypto wallets, exchanges, and security concerns. Diversification: For many investors, Spot Ethereum ETFs offer a way to diversify their portfolios beyond traditional assets and even beyond Bitcoin, tapping into the growth potential of the second-largest cryptocurrency.

This institutional embrace of Ethereum through ETFs can have several profound effects: Price Appreciation for ETH: As demand for the underlying asset (Ethereum) increases due to ETF purchases, it naturally puts upward pressure on ETH’s price. ETFs acquire ETH from the open market to back their shares, effectively reducing the circulating supply available for retail investors. Increased Market Confidence: The sustained inflows signal a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term viability and growth potential, which can inspire confidence among retail investors and potentially attract new participants to the market. Enhanced Legitimacy of Crypto: Each successful launch and sustained inflow into a regulated crypto ETF further solidifies the perception of cryptocurrencies as legitimate, investable assets, moving them beyond their early reputation as speculative ventures. Paving the Way for Other Altcoin ETFs: The success of Spot Ethereum ETFs could set a precedent for other major altcoins to potentially receive ETF approvals in the future, further expanding the institutional reach into the digital asset space.

2025-07-24 04:00:24+00:00,XRP Price Prediction: Could a Stunning New All-Time High Be Next?,"BitcoinWorld XRP Price Prediction: Could a Stunning New All-Time High Be Next? The cryptocurrency market is a whirlwind of rapid shifts, and XRP, Ripple’s native digital asset, is no stranger to this volatility. Recently, XRP experienced a notable plummet of approximately 10% within a 24-hour window, leaving many investors wondering about its immediate future. Yet, amidst this downturn, a beacon of optimism has emerged from an unexpected source, hinting at a potentially stunning comeback. Could this be the prelude to a new all-time high for XRP? A Bold XRP Price Prediction from a Crypto Veteran Despite the recent market jitters, Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, the deputy CEO of the prominent European crypto platform Bitpanda, has shared a remarkably bullish outlook for XRP. In a recent statement to Cointelegraph, Enzersdorfer-Konrad suggested that a new all-time high for Ripple (XRP) is not out of the realm of possibility. This perspective offers a compelling counter-narrative to the short-term price decline, injecting a dose of hope into the XRP community. “While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact levels in such a fast-moving market, a further move beyond the current all-time high would not be surprising if market conditions remain favourable and capital rotation from Bitcoin continues,” the Bitpanda executive stated. This insight underscores two critical factors that could propel XRP upwards: sustained favorable market conditions and a continued shift of capital from Bitcoin into altcoins. Understanding the Dynamics Behind an Optimistic XRP Price Prediction What exactly do “favorable market conditions” and “capital rotation from Bitcoin” mean for the future of XRP? These concepts are fundamental to understanding altcoin price movements and are crucial for any informed XRP price prediction . Capital Rotation: The Engine of Altcoin Rallies In the cryptocurrency world, capital rotation describes the cyclical flow of investment capital through different assets. Typically, a bull market often begins with Bitcoin (BTC) leading the charge, as investors flock to the largest and most established cryptocurrency. Once Bitcoin’s rally cools off or stabilizes, profits often rotate into large-cap altcoins, followed by mid-cap, and eventually small-cap altcoins. This process fuels significant rallies across the altcoin market. Phase 1: Bitcoin Dominance: Investors primarily buy Bitcoin, driving its price up. Phase 2: Large-Cap Altcoin Surge: Profits from Bitcoin are reinvested into established altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and, notably, XRP. Phase 3: Mid and Small-Cap Altcoin Mania: As large-cap altcoins reach new highs, capital trickles down to smaller, more speculative assets. For XRP to achieve a new all-time high, this capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins needs to be robust and sustained. Enzersdorfer-Konrad’s view suggests he sees evidence of this trend continuing, providing a strong foundation for his optimistic XRP price prediction . The Broader Altcoin Market Momentum Beyond capital rotation, the overall momentum of the altcoin market plays a significant role. If the collective sentiment across the altcoin space remains positive, driven by factors like increasing adoption, technological advancements, or favorable regulatory news, then individual assets like XRP are more likely to thrive. A rising tide lifts all boats, and XRP’s short-term trajectory is intricately linked to this broader market health. XRP’s Historical Journey: Peaks and Valleys To truly appreciate the potential for a new all-time high, it’s helpful to look back at XRP’s performance. XRP has a storied history, having experienced incredible surges and significant corrections. Its current all-time high was achieved in January 2018, when it reached approximately $3.84. Since then, it has faced numerous challenges, including a prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At the time of the original report, XRP was trading around $3.22, significantly below its peak. The journey back to, and potentially beyond, its previous all-time high would represent a remarkable recovery and a testament to its resilience. What Challenges Could Hinder This XRP Price Prediction? While optimism abounds, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential hurdles that could impede XRP’s path to a new record high. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously unpredictable, and several factors could influence XRP’s trajectory: Regulatory Uncertainty: The ongoing legal dispute with the SEC remains a significant overhang. While there have been favorable rulings for Ripple, a definitive resolution is still pending and could introduce volatility. Market Volatility: Sudden market corrections, driven by macroeconomic events, global financial shifts, or unexpected news, could derail upward momentum.

Enzersdorfer-Konrad’s view suggests he sees evidence of this trend continuing, providing a strong foundation for his optimistic XRP price prediction . The Broader Altcoin Market Momentum Beyond capital rotation, the overall momentum of the altcoin market plays a significant role. If the collective sentiment across the altcoin space remains positive, driven by factors like increasing adoption, technological advancements, or favorable regulatory news, then individual assets like XRP are more likely to thrive. A rising tide lifts all boats, and XRP’s short-term trajectory is intricately linked to this broader market health. XRP’s Historical Journey: Peaks and Valleys To truly appreciate the potential for a new all-time high, it’s helpful to look back at XRP’s performance. XRP has a storied history, having experienced incredible surges and significant corrections. Its current all-time high was achieved in January 2018, when it reached approximately $3.84. Since then, it has faced numerous challenges, including a prolonged legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). At the time of the original report, XRP was trading around $3.22, significantly below its peak. The journey back to, and potentially beyond, its previous all-time high would represent a remarkable recovery and a testament to its resilience. What Challenges Could Hinder This XRP Price Prediction? While optimism abounds, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential hurdles that could impede XRP’s path to a new record high. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously unpredictable, and several factors could influence XRP’s trajectory: Regulatory Uncertainty: The ongoing legal dispute with the SEC remains a significant overhang. While there have been favorable rulings for Ripple, a definitive resolution is still pending and could introduce volatility. Market Volatility: Sudden market corrections, driven by macroeconomic events, global financial shifts, or unexpected news, could derail upward momentum. Competition: The blockchain space is highly competitive, with new projects constantly emerging. XRP must continue to demonstrate its utility and adoption to maint"

The order, published as Release No. 34-103531, concluded that the proposal was “consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act” because it is designed “to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, [and] to protect investors and the public interest. Another Spot XRP ETF On Hold Bitwise’s trust already trades over the counter under the symbol BITW, but the conversion to an exchange-traded fund would have moved the vehicle onto a national exchange for the first time. The SEC’s order records the fund’s most recent asset mix: 78.72 percent Bitcoin, 11.10 percent Ether and 4.97 percent XRP, with the remaining allocation spread across Solana , Cardano, Sui, Chainlink, Avalanche, Litecoin and Polkadot. Although the weightings are subject to monthly rebalancing, the Commission required that at least 85 percent of the portfolio remain in assets that already underpin other SEC-approved exchange-traded products, effectively capping the combined share of smaller altcoins at 15 percent. Almost immediately after the Division of Trading & Markets issued its delegated approval, the Commission’s Office of the Secretary intervened. In a brief letter citing Rule 431 of the SEC’s Rules of Practice, Assistant Secretary Sherry R. Haywood notified NYSE Arca that “the Commission will review the delegated action” and that, “in accordance with Rule 431(e), the July 22 order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise. The stay freezes the conversion process and leaves BITW in its current OTC-traded form. The procedural whiplash drew immediate reactions from ETF specialists on X. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote , “We have approval of the Bitwise 10 Index fund — BITW — but just like Grayscale’s GDLC earlier this month, Bitwise has been stayed by either one or multiple commissioners. Meaning they cannot actually convert it into an ETF … yet.” Fellow analyst Nate Geraci called the episode a “bizarre situation,” arguing that both Bitwise and Grayscale “should be allowed to convert/uplist asap.” The stay mechanism mirrors the Commission’s treatment of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF earlier in July, underscoring internal divisions over how quickly to expand US crypto-ETF offerings beyond single-asset products. Because Rule 431 reviews are discretionary and open-ended, there is no statutory deadline for the Commission to lift the pause or issue a final ruling. Historically, reviews can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months; during that window the approval order carries no legal effect.

First, whether the inclusion of XRP — long a flash point in the SEC’s crypto enforcement agenda — influenced one or more commissioners to seek additional scrutiny. Second, whether the Commission will use the review to impose new conditions on multi-asset crypto ETFs, such as stricter custody, pricing or surveillance standards. While the stay has no immediate impact on BITW shareholders, Bitwise has argued that an NYSE-listed ETF would tighten spreads, eliminate premium-discount dislocations and broaden distribution through brokerage platforms that refuse to handle OTC products. In its submission the company also contended that regulated exchange trading “will enhance transparency and investor protection” by subjecting the shares to the consolidated tape and the Exchange Act’s reporting framework. For now, the fund’s fate rests with a Commission that is visibly wrestling with the speed at which to open the US market to diversified crypto exposure.

2025-07-24 04:10:18+00:00,US Government Bitcoin: Unveiling the Staggering $23.5 Billion Stash’s Four-Month Freeze,"BitcoinWorld US Government Bitcoin: Unveiling the Staggering $23.5 Billion Stash’s Four-Month Freeze The world of cryptocurrency is often characterized by rapid movements and constant shifts. Yet, amidst this dynamic landscape, one significant player has remained remarkably static: the US government Bitcoin holdings. For four consecutive months, an estimated 198,000 BTC, currently valued at a staggering $23.5 billion, has sat undisturbed across various government wallets. This fascinating stability, highlighted by data from Arkham on X, prompts a deeper dive into the implications of such a colossal, yet inactive, digital asset portfolio. Unpacking the US Government Bitcoin Stash: A Closer Look at the $23.5 Billion Mystery The sheer scale of the US government Bitcoin reserves is truly remarkable. Comprising almost 200,000 BTC, this digital treasure chest is not concentrated in a single wallet but is distributed among several key federal agencies. These holdings primarily originate from seizures related to criminal activities, ranging from drug trafficking to cybercrime and money laundering operations. The process of acquiring and managing these assets involves complex legal procedures and inter-agency coordination. According to insights shared by Arkham, the primary custodians of this immense wealth include: Department of Justice (DOJ): Often involved in high-profile seizures from major criminal enterprises. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): Frequently at the forefront of cybercrime investigations leading to digital asset confiscations. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA): Targets illicit drug operations that often utilize cryptocurrencies for transactions. U.S. Marshals Service (USMS): Responsible for managing and ultimately liquidating seized assets, including cryptocurrencies. It is important to note, as Arkham pointed out, that the publicly disclosed 28,988 BTC by the USMS represents only a fraction of the government’s total digital asset holdings. This suggests a significant portion remains under the direct control or oversight of other agencies, or is simply not publicly detailed, adding a layer of intrigue to the situation. The consistent non-movement of these funds raises questions about the government’s strategy and future plans regarding these substantial assets. Why Has the US Government Bitcoin Stash Remained Untouched for Four Months? The prolonged dormancy of such a significant crypto hoard is not without potential explanations. Unlike private investors who might actively trade or stake their assets, government entities operate under different protocols and constraints. Several factors could contribute to this extended period of inactivity: Legal and Custodial Processes: Seized assets, especially those involved in ongoing legal cases, are often held in secure custody until final court orders or appeals are resolved. This can be a lengthy process, preventing any immediate liquidation or movement. Market Conditions Assessment: Governments, like large institutional investors, may be assessing market conditions. Given the volatility of Bitcoin, a decision to hold could be strategic, awaiting more favorable market conditions for potential liquidation to maximize recovery value. Policy Development: The U.S. government is still in the nascent stages of developing comprehensive policies for managing digital assets. There might be internal discussions, policy reviews, or legislative considerations underway that dictate a ‘wait and see’ approach before making significant moves. Operational Logistics: Moving such large quantities of Bitcoin requires robust security protocols, internal approvals, and technical infrastructure. The logistics involved in preparing for a potential sale or transfer can be complex and time-consuming. This period of inaction might signal a cautious, methodical approach rather than a lack of interest or awareness. It underscores the unique challenges and considerations governments face when managing assets like Bitcoin, which blur the lines between traditional financial instruments and novel digital commodities. The Enormous Scale of US Government Bitcoin Holdings: A Global Perspective To truly grasp the magnitude of the US government Bitcoin holdings, it helps to put them into context. With 198,000 BTC, the U.S. government ranks among the largest known single holders of Bitcoin globally, surpassing many publicly traded companies and even some nation-states that have adopted Bitcoin as a reserve asset. Consider the following comparison points (values are approximate and subject to change): Entity Approximate BTC Holdings Notes U.S. Government ~198,000 BTC Seized assets, across multiple agencies.

From large-scale liquidations to shifts in Bitcoin dominance, several factors are contributing to this market-wide correction. Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,514, showing a mild 0.11% gain in the past 24 hours and a 0.35% gain over the past week. Ethereum, on the other hand, is doing much better with a price of $3,644, dropping 2.23% in the last day.. XRP is down 8.53% in the last 24 hours. Solana has also dipped more than 5%, now trading at $190.03. DOGE, ADA and XLM have also dropped by more than 7% in the last 24 hours. Why The Sudden Shift? To start with, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies currently stands at $3.88 trillion, which is down by 1.4% in the last 24 hours. One of the biggest reasons behind this drop is the unwinding of crypto derivatives. Over $634 billion worth of open interest in futures and options was liquidated in just one day, marking an 11% decline in the derivatives market. Another factor is the decline in Bitcoin’s dominance. Over the past 30 days, Bitcoin’s market share has dropped by 5.4%. However, in the last week, it has found some stability around 60.88%. This means less capital is flowing into altcoins. Despite these individual gains, the overall crypto market is still cooling off. According to the Altcoin Season Index, which is currently at 43 out of 100, the market is not yet in what’s called a true altcoin season. For that to happen, the index needs to climb above 75. So, is this the start of a larger correction? Not necessarily. What the market is seeing right now appears to be a healthy and expected pullback after weeks of strong bullish rallies. These kinds of dips are common in the crypto world and often offer new entry points for long-term investors.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-is-the-crypto-market-going-down-today-2/,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|ADA,News|Crypto news,BTC,"Why is the Crypto Market Going Down Today?.
