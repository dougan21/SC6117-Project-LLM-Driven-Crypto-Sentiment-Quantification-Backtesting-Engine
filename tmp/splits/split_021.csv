2025-07-29 11:25:55+00:00,Ethereum open interest hits 2-year peak in dominance as funds spill over from Bitcoin,"Ethereum now commands nearly 40% of the total crypto open interest, its highest level in over two years, based on data from Glassnode. This dominance has only been topped on 5% of recorded trading days, proving a major turn in where traders are putting their capital. That rotation is coming straight out of Bitcoin , as risk appetite begins to change. Comparison of BTC and ETH perpetual open interest. Source: Glassnode Standard Chartered had projected that Ethereum could hit $4,000 by the end of 2025, which perfectly aligns with what’s playing out in treasury wallets, where Ethereum is now held in higher concentration than Bitcoin, with corporates controlling roughly 1% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. Futures premiums climb as ETF inflows fuel conviction Ethereum’s momentum has also pushed the futures premium to 8%, which is its highest reading in five months. This premium, which typically ranges between 5% and 10% in neutral markets, compensates for longer contract settlement times and reflects speculative appetite. The kicker is that this increase comes right after Ethereum’s 55% price gain over the last three weeks, and yet the demand for leverage hasn’t cooled. The setup indicates traders still see room to load up if prices rise above $4,000 with more strength. The options skew, which shows expectations for either upside or downside movement, has flipped back to neutral. A week ago, the 30-day delta skew showed 8% bullish sentiment, but that has now evened out. This reset, however, hasn’t pushed traders into defensive mode. Professionals haven’t raised protection against pullbacks despite Ethereum hitting a seven-month high, which means they’re still comfortable with current exposure levels. A major factor behind Ethereum’s recent strength is the influx of cash into spot ETFs . Between July 11 and last Friday, net inflows hit $4.23 billion, lifting total U.S.-listed Ether ETF assets under management to $17.24 billion. That inflow volume has been one of the strongest among crypto products this year and has helped fuel the recent surge in open interest dominance. Meanwhile, StrategicEthReserve disclosed that more than 40 companies now hold at least 1,000 ETH in their corporate reserves. At today’s prices, that’s about $3.8 million per firm. Big holders include Bitmine Immersion Tech, SharpLink Gaming, and The Ether Machine, who together own $8.84 billion worth of Ethereum. Bitcoin’s cooling off gives Ethereum space to climb As Ethereum gains traction, Bitcoin is showing signs of fatigue. Its spot price recently tested the upper end of a wide range between $104,000 and $114,000, touching its all-time high before pulling back. That retracement dragged broader market sentiment with it. The futures market is still running hot. Open interest rose to $45.6 billion, staying near the high end of its band. Long traders continued to dominate, pushing funding rates higher and reinforcing the presence of leveraged longs. Selling pressure in perpetual contracts also eased, with the Perpetual CVD showing fewer aggressive sell-offs, which suggests the market is stabilizing, though cautiously. The options market, however, is getting jittery. While open interest fell 2.2%, the volatility spread surged 77%, showing a dramatic rise in expected price swings. The 25 Delta Skew also turned slightly positive, reflecting fading demand for downside protection and more balanced sentiment among traders. ETF activity in Bitcoin has slowed dramatically. Net inflows dropped by 80% to $496 million, and total trade volume declined to $18.7 billion. Yet, ETF MVRV remains elevated at 2.4, suggesting plenty of unrealized profits remain in the system, even as buyers cool off. Source: Glassnode Glassnode’s capital rotation indicators also confirm that speculative traders are more active right now. The STH/LTH ratio and Hot Capital Share are both slightly up, suggesting a small but noticeable rise in short-term risk appetite — one that’s increasingly pointed at Ethereum. Profit-taking is also slowing down across both assets. Right now, 96.9% of all Ethereum in circulation is still in profit, based on realized price data. But Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) and the Realized P/L Ratio have both dipped this week, showing that investors are holding back on locking in gains while momentum finds new direction.

2025-07-29 11:40:10+00:00,"Bitcoin Whale’s Astounding Awakening: 1,368x Gain Sends $15.45M to Kraken","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale’s Astounding Awakening: 1,368x Gain Sends $15.45M to Kraken Imagine waking up after a long nap, only to find that a tiny investment you made over a decade ago has ballooned into a fortune. This isn’t a fantasy for one long-dormant Bitcoin Whale that recently made headlines, sending ripples through the cryptocurrency market. After 12 years of absolute stillness, this colossal entity, a true relic of Bitcoin’s early days, has finally stirred, moving a staggering amount of BTC and showcasing one of the most incredible returns on investment in financial history. What Just Happened with This Bitcoin Whale? The crypto world was abuzz when Lookonchain, a prominent blockchain analytics firm, reported a significant transaction. A wallet, which had been inactive since April 2012, suddenly moved 343 Bitcoin (BTC). At the time of the transaction, this amount was valued at approximately $40.5 million. The most astonishing detail? A substantial portion of this, precisely 130.7 BTC, equivalent to $15.45 million, was sent to the Kraken exchange. To truly grasp the magnitude of this event, let’s look at the numbers. This particular Bitcoin Whale initially acquired its BTC when the price hovered around a mere $86 per coin. Fast forward 12 years, and with Bitcoin’s price soaring, this initial investment has yielded an mind-boggling 1,368x return. This isn’t just a gain; it’s a testament to the power of long-term holding in a volatile, yet potentially incredibly rewarding, asset class. Here’s a quick breakdown of the whale’s incredible journey: Initial Acquisition: April 2012 BTC Acquired: 343 BTC Initial Price Per BTC: ~$86 Initial Investment: ~$29,498 Current Value of 343 BTC (at $118,000/BTC approx.): ~$40,500,000 Portion Sent to Kraken: 130.7 BTC (~$15.45 million) Return on Investment: 1,368x Understanding the ‘Dormant Bitcoin Whale’ Phenomenon The term ‘dormant Bitcoin Whale ‘ refers to an individual or entity holding a massive amount of Bitcoin that has remained untouched for an extended period, often years. These wallets are like time capsules, holding secrets from Bitcoin’s nascent stages. When such a wallet becomes active, it captures the attention of the entire crypto community because of the potential implications. Why do these whales suddenly move their funds after so long? There could be several reasons: Profit Realization: The most obvious reason is to take profits, especially after significant price surges. For someone who bought BTC at $86, current prices offer an irresistible opportunity to cash out a portion of their holdings. Diversification: Whales might move funds to diversify their portfolio, perhaps into other cryptocurrencies, traditional assets, or even real estate. Liquidity Needs: Personal financial needs, large purchases, or investments outside of crypto could necessitate moving such a large sum. Security Concerns: Sometimes, movements are for enhanced security, transferring funds from older, potentially less secure wallet types to newer, more robust solutions. Estate Planning: In some cases, these movements could be related to inheritance or estate management, as the original owner may no longer be able to manage the funds. The sudden activity of a dormant Bitcoin Whale often sparks speculation about market direction, potential selling pressure, and overall sentiment. The Anatomy of a 1,368x Bitcoin Whale Gain: How is This Possible? Achieving a 1,368x return on any investment is extraordinary, let alone in just over a decade. This particular Bitcoin Whale ‘s story highlights several key aspects of early Bitcoin investment and the power of ‘HODLing’ (holding on for dear life), a term coined by the crypto community for long-term holding strategies. Let’s consider the mechanics: Metric Value Initial Investment Date April 2012 Bitcoin Price (2012) ~$86 Bitcoin Price (Current, illustrative) ~$118,000 Factor of Increase ~1,372x This massive appreciation is a direct result of Bitcoin’s journey from an obscure digital currency to a global asset. Early adopters like this Bitcoin Whale took a significant risk when Bitcoin was still largely unknown and unproven. Their patience, or perhaps simply forgetfulness, paid off handsomely as Bitcoin gained mainstream adoption, institutional interest, and surged in value over successive bull runs. What Does This Bitcoin Whale Movement Mean for the Market? When a significant amount of BTC moves, especially from a long-dormant wallet, the market takes notice. The transfer of $15.45 million to Kraken, a major cryptocurrency exchange, specifically raises questions about potential selling pressure. Here are some potential implications: Increased Supply on Exchanges: Moving funds to an exchange typically means the owner intends to sell. An influx of BTC onto exchanges can increase the available supply, which, if met with insufficient demand, could lead to a temporary price dip.

2025-07-29 11:40:59+00:00,Ray Dalio Advises 15% Allocation in Bitcoin or Gold Amid Soaring U.S. Debt,"American billionaire investor Ray Dalio has recommended that investors consider allocating up to 15% of their portfolios in Bitcoin or gold, as a hedge against rising national debt and currency devaluation in the United States. Speaking on the Master Investor podcast on Sunday, the founder of Bridgewater Associates warned of a worsening economic environment that could erode the value of traditional assets. “[If] you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin,” Dalio stated, emphasizing the importance of diversifying into hard assets. Although he acknowledged holding a small amount of BTC himself, Dalio reaffirmed his preference for gold over the digital asset. The proportion between the two, he noted, should be left to individual investor discretion. Dalio’s updated recommendation marks a notable increase from the 1–2% Bitcoin exposure he proposed back in January 2022. The shift underscores growing concerns over America’s ballooning debt, which now stands at $36.7 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury data. Debt Spiral Raises Demand for Hard Assets Dalio’s remarks come at a time when the U.S. Treasury has projected unprecedented levels of borrowing. A report released on Monday estimated $1 trillion in new debt for the third quarter of 2025—$453 billion higher than earlier forecasts—due to weaker cash flows and dwindling reserves. An additional $590 billion is expected to be borrowed in Q4, highlighting the federal government’s increasing dependence on debt financing. “The issue is the devaluation of money,” Dalio cautioned, adding that the U.S. will likely need to issue another $12 trillion in Treasurys over the next year. He warned that this strategy could lead to a “debt doom loop,” a concern he believes also applies to other developed nations like the United Kingdom. Bitcoin and Gold Show Strength in Uncertain Times Dalio considers Bitcoin and gold to be “effective diversifiers” in a portfolio, especially in economies grappling with inflation and fiscal instability. However, he expressed skepticism about Bitcoin’s suitability as a reserve currency , citing its lack of privacy and transparency of transactions as drawbacks. Both Bitcoin and gold have been performing strongly in recent months. BTC is trading around $118,100, just 4% shy of its all-time high of $123,230 recorded on July 14. Meanwhile, gold continues to notch record highs, driven by investor appetite for safe-haven assets in a volatile global economy.

2025-07-29 11:45:20+00:00,25 Years of Life Savings ‘Gone’ After Mechanic Enters Bank To Buy House – Money Ends Up in Scammers’ Accounts,"An Australian couple lost about $293,000 to scammers after entering a Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) branch to transfer money to buy a house. The couple, Jimmy and Leanne, wanted to buy a house for Jimmy’s parents south of Sydney, but the cost of the home exceeded the purchase price by nearly half a million Australian dollars. Jimmy, a mechanic, says in a new interview with A Current Affair that he trusted a conveyancer going by the name Kylie Drain to handle the property settlement. He went to his local Commonwealth Bank to transfer the money into Drain’s account according to instructions he’d received via email. Explains Jimmy, “I trusted this bank. I trusted the people who worked here.” The bank teller reportedly unwittingly facilitated a money transfer to a scammer posing as the conveyancer, with 25 years’ worth of the couple’s life savings disappearing in the process. Both Jimmy and the conveyancing practice, Active Property Conveyancing, claim their emails weren’t hacked. However, Jimmy tells A Current Affair he believes Active Property Conveyancing was the hacking target. “It’s known that solicitors and conveyancers, or people that deal with lots of money, are the ones that get compromised, not some little Hotmail account or an Outlook account. So my argument is, if your system was compromised and they’ve stolen my information and sent me an email, how is that my fault?” The conveyancing practice says Jimmy didn’t contact them before transferring the money as instructed in their email signature. The firm says its insurance won’t cover the loss. Jimmy filed a complaint with the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) about Commonwealth Bank, but the regulator reportedly ruled in favor of the bank because the couple signed a form confirming the details of the transaction were in order. The regulator also said the bank isn’t required to advise customers about their transactions.

An Australian couple lost about $293,000 to scammers after entering a Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) branch to transfer money to buy a house. The couple, Jimmy and Leanne, wanted to buy a house for Jimmy’s parents south of Sydney, but the cost of the home exceeded the purchase price by nearly half a million Australian dollars.

2025-07-29 11:55:11+00:00,BitMine’s Bold $1 Billion Share Buyback: A Strategic Move for Crypto Holders,"BitcoinWorld BitMine’s Bold $1 Billion Share Buyback: A Strategic Move for Crypto Holders In a significant development that has sent ripples across both the traditional finance and cryptocurrency sectors, BitMine Immersion Technologies has announced a monumental financial maneuver. The company’s board has given the green light to a substantial stock repurchase program, totaling up to $1 billion . This strategic decision, funded in part by BitMine’s impressive $401 million in cash reserves and underpinned by its considerable holdings of 625,000 ETH and 192 BTC , signals a strong vote of confidence from the company’s leadership. This news, reported by PR Newswire , positions the BitMine share buyback as a key event for investors to watch. Understanding the BitMine Share Buyback: What is a Stock Repurchase? Before diving into the specifics of BitMine’s announcement, it’s crucial to understand what a stock repurchase, or share buyback, entails. Essentially, it’s a corporate action where a company buys back its own shares from the open market. This reduces the number of outstanding shares, which can have several positive implications for existing shareholders. Companies typically undertake a share buyback for a variety of reasons: Boosting Shareholder Value: By reducing the number of shares, each remaining share represents a larger percentage of company ownership, potentially increasing earnings per share (EPS). Returning Capital to Shareholders: Instead of issuing dividends, which are taxed immediately, a buyback can be a more tax-efficient way to return value to investors. Signaling Confidence: A buyback often indicates that management believes the company’s stock is undervalued, sending a positive signal to the market. Improving Financial Ratios: Reduced share count can improve key financial metrics, making the company appear more attractive to investors. Offsetting Dilution: If a company issues new shares (e.g., for employee stock options), a buyback can counteract the dilutive effect. The decision for a BitMine share buyback of this magnitude suggests a calculated move to optimize its capital structure and enhance shareholder returns in a unique market landscape. BitMine’s Strategic Play: Unpacking the $1 Billion Program BitMine Immersion Technologies, a prominent player in the crypto mining and technology space, is making a definitive statement with its latest financial move. The approval of a $1 billion stock repurchase program is not just a routine financial decision; it’s a bold declaration of financial strength and strategic intent. Here’s a closer look at the key elements of this significant announcement: Scale of the Program: A staggering $1 billion is earmarked for the share buyback. This represents a substantial commitment, especially for a company operating in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. It demonstrates BitMine’s confidence in its long-term prospects and its current valuation. Funding Mechanism: The program will be funded from BitMine’s existing financial resources. Crucially, the company boasts $401 million in cash . This strong cash position provides the immediate liquidity needed to initiate and sustain such a large-scale repurchase without relying on external financing. Crypto Holdings as a Strategic Asset: What truly sets BitMine apart is its significant digital asset portfolio. The company holds 625,000 ETH (Ethereum) and 192 BTC (Bitcoin) . While the immediate funding for the buyback comes from cash, these substantial crypto holdings serve as a powerful underlying asset base, offering both potential future liquidity and a testament to the company’s core business model. The value of these assets can fluctuate, but their presence provides a unique dimension to BitMine’s financial strategy. This BitMine share buyback is a testament to the company’s robust balance sheet and its willingness to deploy capital in a manner that directly benefits its investors. What Does This Mean for Investors? Benefits of a Share Buyback For current and prospective investors, the announcement of a BitMine share buyback carries several potential positive implications. How might this strategic move impact your investment? 1. Potential for Increased Share Price: When a company reduces the number of its outstanding shares, the supply of shares in the market decreases. If demand remains constant or increases, this can lead to an upward pressure on the share price. Investors holding shares before the buyback could see the value of their holdings appreciate. 2. Enhanced Earnings Per Share (EPS): EPS is calculated by dividing a company’s net income by the number of outstanding shares. By reducing the share count, even if net income remains the same, EPS will increase. A higher EPS often makes a company appear more profitable and attractive to investors, potentially driving up its stock multiple. 3. Improved Return on Equity (ROE): Share buybacks can also improve a company’s ROE, a key profitability metric.

2025-07-29 11:58:46+00:00,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 29, 2025","In a complete reversal from yesterday, the crypto market is down today, with 98 of the top 100 coins per market turning red. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by another 5.5% over the past 24 hours and below $4 trillion, now standing at $3.97 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $172 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap dropped below $4 trillion; 98 of the top 100 coins are down, as are 9 out of the top 10 coins; BTC trades at $118,808 and ETH at $3,807; BTC is expected to be more volatile over the next 90 days; Chances of ETH hitting $4,500 by 29 August surged to 45%; XRP is regaining momentum; US ETH spot ETFs hit the 17th inflow day in a row with $65.14 million; US BTC spot ETFs recorded positive flows of $157.03 million; ’BTC is being accumulated on both sides, the dip and higher levels’; ’The market’s been flashing signs of overheating’; Market sentiment indicates rising caution. Crypto Winners & Losers By the time of writing, all but one top 10 coin per market capitalization have dropped over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 0.6% in a day, now trading at $118,808. This is the smallest drop on this list today. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is down by 3.1% and is now trading at $3,807. Dogecoin (DOGE) fell the most. It’s down 7.7% to the price of $0.2282. Tron (TRX) is the only coin in the category that increased today: 2.3% to $0.3294. As for the top 100 coins, two coins are up. Besides Tron, Conflux (CFX) increased by 27.9% to $0.2457. On the other hand, Sky (SKY) fell the most. It has decreased by 10.2% to $0.08978. Jupiter (JUP) is next, having dropped 9.4% to $0.5592. This will be a very busy week in the US specifically, with a number of earnings and economic news set to hit the markets, including crypto. This includes additional trade and tariff deals, additional earnings reports from tech companies, second-quarter GDP data, the July jobs report, and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision. ‘BTC is Expected to be More Volatile Over the Next 90 Days’ Sean Dawson, Head of Research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , said that prices have been largely stable across the board in the past 24 hours. “BTC is expected to be more volatile over the next 90 days than the next 30. Meanwhile, ETH was predicted to have lower short-term volatility earlier this month, but this has since reversed,” Dawson writes. Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata BTC’s 30-day ATM volatility has dropped to its lowest level in two weeks, now sitting at 36%, down from a peak of 40%. “BTC’s 30-day ATM volatility has dropped to its lowest level in the last fortnight, now sitting at 36%, down from a peak of 40%,” he says. Additionally, BTC’s chances of reaching $150,000 by August have stagnated over the past week, currently standing just below 20%. But the chances of ETH hitting $4,500 by 29 August jumped to 45% from 5% at the start of July. “Since May, ETH has been on an absolute tear relative to BTC. The ETH/BTC ratio has almost doubled from 0.018 BTC per ETH to 0.0325,” Dawson says. “The rise of ETH treasury companies like Bitmine and Ethermachine signals growing institutional alignment and could mark the start of a new alt season heading into Q3 2025.” Furthermore, blockchain data platform Glassnode found on Monday that BTC’s $117,000 level was still attracting demand. “The $110,000–$117,000 range is gradually filling in. BTC is being accumulated on both sides – buyers stepping in on dips, while earlier buyers are now acquiring at higher levels,” they also wrote . $BTC options skew shows an unusual divergence: 1M puts trade at a premium (+4.6%), while 1W skew lags. This suggests near-term bullish sentiment, with traders using 1W calls, while 1M downside protection signals hedging or profit-taking on the rally. pic.twitter.com/QwJyWSdWXm — glassnode (@glassnode) July 28, 2025 Meanwhile, Tom Bruni, VP of Community and Editor-in-Chief at Stocktwits , commented that “the market’s been flashing signs of overheating, with meme stocks and altcoins taking the spotlight.” However, “despite all the noise,” Bruni says, major indexes barely moved, while international stocks remained range-bound.

In a complete reversal from yesterday, the crypto market is down today, with 98 of the top 100 coins per market turning red. The cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by another 5.5% over the past 24 hours and below $4 trillion, now standing at $3.97 trillion. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $172 billion. TLDR: Crypto market cap dropped below $4 trillion; 98 of the top 100 coins are down, as are 9 out of the top 10 coins; BTC trades at $118,808 and ETH at $3,807; BTC is expected to be more volatile over the next 90 days; Chances of ETH hitting $4,500 by 29 August surged to 45%; XRP is regaining momentum; US ETH spot ETFs hit the 17th inflow day in a row with $65.14 million; US BTC spot ETFs recorded positive flows of $157.03 million; ’BTC is being accumulated on both sides, the dip and higher levels’; ’The market’s been flashing signs of overheating’; Market sentiment indicates rising caution. Crypto Winners & Losers By the time of writing, all but one top 10 coin per market capitalization have dropped over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 0.6% in a day, now trading at $118,808. This is the smallest drop on this list today. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is down by 3.1% and is now trading at $3,807. Dogecoin (DOGE) fell the most. It’s down 7.7% to the price of $0.2282. Tron (TRX) is the only coin in the category that increased today: 2.3% to $0.3294. As for the top 100 coins, two coins are up. Besides Tron, Conflux (CFX) increased by 27.9% to $0.2457. On the other hand, Sky (SKY) fell the most. It has decreased by 10.2% to $0.08978. Jupiter (JUP) is next, having dropped 9.4% to $0.5592. This will be a very busy week in the US specifically, with a number of earnings and economic news set to hit the markets, including crypto. This includes additional trade and tariff deals, additional earnings reports from tech companies, second-quarter GDP data, the July jobs report, and the Federal Reserve interest rate decision. ‘BTC is Expected to be More Volatile Over the Next 90 Days’ Sean Dawson, Head of Research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , said that prices have been largely stable across the board in the past 24 hours. “BTC is expected to be more volatile over the next 90 days than the next 30. Meanwhile, ETH was predicted to have lower short-term volatility earlier this month, but this has since reversed,” Dawson writes. Source: Derive.xyz, Amberdata BTC’s 30-day ATM volatility has dropped to its lowest level in two weeks, now sitting at 36%, down from a peak of 40%. “BTC’s 30-day ATM volatility has dropped to its lowest level in the last fortnight, now sitting at 36%, down from a peak of 40%,” he says. Additionally, BTC’s chances of reaching $150,000 by August have stagnated over the past week, currently standing just below 20%. But the chances of ETH hitting $4,500 by 29 August jumped to 45% from 5% at the start of July. “Since May, ETH has been on an absolute tear relative to BTC. The ETH/BTC ratio has almost doubled from 0.018 BTC per ETH to 0.0325,” Dawson says. “The rise of ETH treasury companies like Bitmine and Ethermachine signals growing institutional alignment and could mark the start of a new alt season heading into Q3 2025.” Furthermore, blockchain data platform Glassnode found on Monday that BTC’s $117,000 level was still attracting demand. “The $110,000–$117,000 range is gradually filling in. BTC is being accumulated on both sides – buyers stepping in on dips, while earlier buyers are now acquiring at higher levels,” they also wrote . $BTC options skew shows an unusual divergence: 1M puts trade at a premium (+4.6%), while 1W skew lags. This suggests near-term bullish sentiment, with traders using 1W calls, while 1M downside protection signals hedging or profit-taking on the rally. pic.twitter.com/QwJyWSdWXm — glassnode (@glassnode) July 28, 2025 Meanwhile, Tom Bruni, VP of Community and Editor-in-Chief at Stocktwits , commented that “the market’s been flashing signs of overheating, with meme stocks and altcoins taking the spotlight.” However, “despite all the noise,” Bruni says, major indexes barely moved, while international stocks remained range-bound.

Altcoin’s are “oscillators at best” and two ingredients for their success are missing. Cryptocurrency deregulation will benefit Ethereum more than Bitcoin. The Dencun and Pectra upgrades sharply lowered fees going to the L1 and increased ETH’s inflation. Ethereum is an institutional-gradeblockchain with several unique bullish factors. Thesis: Investor sentiment for Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) shifted dramatically from depressed and apathetic to enthusiastic. The recent drop in Bitcoin Dominance alongside strong positive momentum for Ethereum has translated to predictions of an Altcoin Season. This makes complete sense given that ETH is the Altcoin market’s 600lb gorilla.

Ethereum’s been said to work in an “Ivory Tower” away from the real world as Vitalik philosophizes about blockchain. Developers of Dapps have complained that Ethereum doesn’t reach out to them or “return phone calls” all of which sapped the excitement out of the chain in favor of sexier projects such as Solana ( SOL-USD ). Again, Ethereum’s steady, slow and corporate while Solana is entrepreneurial. Prophetizing Ethereum ETH’s having its most dramatic shift in history as skeptics jump onto the bull bandwagon. Despite being a long-term ETH bull, I have been fairly critical of them on social media (see below).

Investors seemed unconvinced by the plan to make BitMine a major holder and staker of Ethereum . The dip came after shares slid over 10% during regular hours to $35, then dropped another 15% in after‑hours trading. Ethereum: BitMine Shares Plunge Despite Big Claims According to FundStrat’s Tom Lee, BitMine plans to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply and become a “made in America validator network.” He highlighted that BitMine already has 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet—worth more than $2 billion at current prices. Lee even floated the idea that Ether could reach an implied valuation of $60,000, citing unnamed research firms. But those bold figures failed to calm the market. 10/18We asked several research firms to give us “replacement” value (of Wall Street) to value ETH – this is for illustrative purposes only– implied value for ETH is $60,000– ETH currently ~$3,800 pic.twitter.com/mXa5uCZukv — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 28, 2025 Analysts had pointed out that BitMine’s stock had wildly surged earlier this month. The price shot up more than 3,000% to a yearly high of $135 on July 3 after the initial announcement of the Ether‑buying strategy. That rally was met with a wave of profit‑taking once the plan was fully laid out. Many traders sold into the strength, and the mood shifted quickly when shareholders saw the fine print. Investors Question Execution Risks Based on reports from Kronos Research, treasury rollouts on this scale require a solid plan to protect capital and maintain liquidity. Vincent Liu, Kronos’s chief investment officer, warned that without clear steps for custody and staking infrastructure, holding large amounts of Ether could create big swings in value. And those swings spooked some investors when Lee’s “Chairman’s Message” failed to pin down exact timelines or reveal audit partners. On top of that, the implied $60,000 target for Ether came from sources that remain unnamed. That lack of transparency set off alarm bells. Investors want to know who did the math and whether the data holds up under scrutiny. When price targets are presented without clear attribution, doubt grows fast.

That claim has caught the eye of many investors who are weighing where to put their crypto dollars. Strong ROI Comparison Common Sense Crypto ran the numbers. At XRP’s current price of $3.18, a $1,000 buy-in nets roughly 315 tokens. To hit $10k, each XRP would need to trade at $31.80. If XRP somehow climbed to $160, that small stake would swell to $50k. By contrast, a $1k purchase of Bitcoin at $120,000 today would only need BTC to rise to about $154k–$178k to yield the same $1,300–$1,500 returns. Here’s a quick fact to ponder, if you put $1,000 into $xrp today you will most likely end up with at least $10,000 – $50,000 in this cycle, if you put the same $1,000 into $btc you will most like only end up with $1300 – $1500. ROI (return on investment) is more important than… — Common Sense Crypto (@TheCSCrypto) July 12, 2025 Those are gains in the 30–50% range. This puts XRP’s upside in a very different league when viewed purely as percentages. Still, size matters. XRP’s market cap sits near $188 billion. Bitcoin’s floats around $2.37 trillion. To push XRP to $159, its valuation would need to balloon to roughly $9.5 trillion—nearly four times Bitcoin’s current size. That would require massive new inflows and adoption on a scale we’ve never seen in crypto. XRP Tops $3; CEO Sets Sights On 14% Of SWIFT Ripple’s XRP finally breached the long-awaited $3 mark after US President Donald Trump announced a new US strategic crypto reserve, including XRP and other digital assets​. As one of the most traded cryptocurrencies, XRP enjoys high daily trading volumes, ensuring price stability and ease of entry for institutional investors. Ripple’s chief executive, Brad Garlinghouse, predicts that within five years, Ripple will handle about 14% of SWIFT’s worldwide cross‑border transaction flows. Related Reading: Countdown To August 15: What XRP Investors Need To Know Past Cycle Performance Other voices have made similar points. In June, Edoardo Farina of Alpha Lions Academy noted that between November 2024 and January 2025, XRP jumped from $0.50 to $3.40. That’s a 7x return in just two months. Bitcoin, in that same window, climbed from $68k to $112k, a 60% gain. Farina calculated that $50k in XRP would have grown to $340k while the same investment in Bitcoin would have become about $82,352. The XRP 50x Challenge XRP’s promise of turning $1,000 into as much as $50,000 is eye‑catching. Its past leap from $0.50 to $3.40 in just two months shows what’s possible.

This puts XRP’s upside in a very different league when viewed purely as percentages. Still, size matters. XRP’s market cap sits near $188 billion. Bitcoin’s floats around $2.37 trillion. To push XRP to $159, its valuation would need to balloon to roughly $9.5 trillion—nearly four times Bitcoin’s current size. That would require massive new inflows and adoption on a scale we’ve never seen in crypto. XRP Tops $3; CEO Sets Sights On 14% Of SWIFT Ripple’s XRP finally breached the long-awaited $3 mark after US President Donald Trump announced a new US strategic crypto reserve, including XRP and other digital assets​. As one of the most traded cryptocurrencies, XRP enjoys high daily trading volumes, ensuring price stability and ease of entry for institutional investors. Ripple’s chief executive, Brad Garlinghouse, predicts that within five years, Ripple will handle about 14% of SWIFT’s worldwide cross‑border transaction flows.

In June, Edoardo Farina of Alpha Lions Academy noted that between November 2024 and January 2025, XRP jumped from $0.50 to $3.40. That’s a 7x return in just two months. Bitcoin, in that same window, climbed from $68k to $112k, a 60% gain. Farina calculated that $50k in XRP would have grown to $340k while the same investment in Bitcoin would have become about $82,352. The XRP 50x Challenge XRP’s promise of turning $1,000 into as much as $50,000 is eye‑catching. Its past leap from $0.50 to $3.40 in just two months shows what’s possible. But growing its market cap from $188 billion to $9.5 trillion means a tidal wave of new money and clear legal rules. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"

Bitcoin: Bollinger bands tighten BTC''s continued consolidation between $116,000 and $120,000 calls for renewed focus on Bollinger bands, which have now tightened to levels last seen before the late February volatility explosion that saw prices drop from $95,000 to $80,000 within days. Tighter bands indicate that the market is coiling up and building energy for a big move in either direction. Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the asset''s 20-day simple moving average. This view is consistent with the VIX''s bullish August seasonality that suggests heightened price turbulence for stocks and bitcoin over the coming four weeks. A break below $116,000 would imply downside volatility explosion, exposing the former resistance-turned-support at $111,965. Conversely, a quick move to new lifetime highs appears likely if tighter Bollinger bands resolve bullishly. AI''s take: The significant contraction of volatility, especially after a strong uptrend, often signals that the price is coiling up for a large and potentially explosive move in the near future. Resistance: $120,000, $123,181. Support: $116,000-$117,000, $114,700, $111,965.

The cryptocurrency printed a lower high at $3.33, the first since peaking at $3.65 with a bearish tweezer top pattern , indicating a potential deeper pullback ahead. This suggests that it''s only a matter of time before the mini-ascending channel seen on the hourly chart gives way, exposing the recent low of $2.95 and possibly the May high of $2.65. The hurdle at $3.35 must be overcome to negate the bearish bias. AI''s take: Traders should primarily focus on whether XRP can decisively reclaim and hold above the crucial $3.35 level, which now acts as immediate resistance. A failure to do so would reinforce the daily chart''s bearish reversal signals (tweezer top, lower high), suggesting further downside, Resistance: $3.35, $3.65, $4.00.

AI''s take: Traders should primarily focus on the bearish divergence displayed by the RSI , which signals weakening momentum despite Ether''s recent price high. Resistance: $4,000, $4100, $4,382.

2025-07-29 12:00:39+00:00,Elon Musk’s AI Has an Urgent Warning for XRP Holders,"In a recent video shared on X, Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders revealed a critical forecast from Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence platform, Grok, specifically directed at XRP holders. The AI issued an “urgent warning” about the current bull market , highlighting a potential cycle top in the coming months based on a convergence of historical trends, macroeconomic indicators, and Federal Reserve policy decisions. Grok’s Forecast Levi began by explaining the basis of his inquiry to Grok, asking the AI to analyze previous Bitcoin halving cycles alongside key geopolitical and economic factors. Grok responded with a detailed timeline, noting that Bitcoin historically peaks 12 to 18 months after each halving. Bitcoin’s past halvings have been followed by major price tops: the 2012 halving to the November 2013 peak, the 2016 halving to the December 2017 peak, and the 2020 halving to the November 2021 peak. Applying this pattern to the most recent halving in April 2024, Grok estimates a potential peak window between April and October 2025. BREAKING XRP NEWS: Elon Musk''s AI Has A URGENT WARNING For You! #XRP pic.twitter.com/nsxQSGENMa — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 28, 2025 However, based on current conditions and anticipated policy shifts, Grok narrowed this estimate further. The AI predicts the cryptocurrency market will reach its peak sometime between July 1 and September 30, 2025. This updated forecast incorporates the possible impact of upcoming rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, global liquidity levels, and investor behavior leading into a distribution phase. Levi stressed the importance of this forecast, stating, “I think this is crucial… this is its synthesis and estimate.” The Role of the Federal Reserve and Interest Rates A significant part of Grok’s prediction rests on monetary policy. As of June 2025, the U.S. federal funds rate remains steady at 4.25% to 4.50%, following a 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut in December 2024. Investors and policymakers alike are anticipating further rate reductions, possibly in July and September 2025. Levi noted that Grok, while limited in some real-time data, integrates historical responses to rate changes. For example, the Fed’s rapid rate hikes from 0% to 4.5% in 2022 triggered a severe crypto bear market, wiping 78% off Bitcoin’s value. Now, the potential for rate cuts could drive renewed investor confidence. Levi added, “Trump is fully aware that the midterm elections ride very heavily on strong market performance,” suggesting that political pressure may force the Fed’s hand. If rates are cut as expected, Grok’s July–September 2025 window remains intact. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Alternative Scenario To further test the forecast, Levi asked Grok what would happen if the Fed delays further easing until Q4 2025 and continues into Q1 2026. In this scenario, Grok projects a market top between January 1st and March 31st, 2026, pointing to a “cycle extension due to the Fed’s monetary policy and growing M2 during this period.” However, Levi expressed skepticism that other economies, such as China and the EU, can continue quantitative easing, noting their limited fiscal space. “Everybody starts waiting for the United States to start lowering those rates,” he said, reinforcing his belief that the Fed remains the primary driver of market liquidity. XRP Technical Outlook and Investor Strategy While the macro environment remains uncertain, Levi views current price levels as a favorable opportunity for XRP investors. “The stochastic RSI for XRP… is currently in the oversold category,” he said, suggesting that a short-term rally is likely. With XRP and Bitcoin hovering near major support levels, Levi disclosed that he has added to his futures position, anticipating another leg upward. Market Peak Depends on Fed Action Ultimately, Grok’s warning is grounded in data but shaped by uncertainty. If the Fed initiates rate cuts in the coming months, XRP and the broader market may peak between July and September 2025. If delays occur, that top could shift to early 2026. For XRP holders, timing entries and exits around these macroeconomic shifts could prove decisive in navigating this cycle successfully.

2025-07-29 12:15:08+00:00,"PowerBank’s 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Project Goes Live, Powering New Bitcoin Treasury Strategy","July 29th, 2025 – Toronto, Ontario, Canada class=”ql-align-justify”> PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN; Cboe CA: SUNN, FSE: 103) , a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, is excited to announce that its largest owned-and-operated asset in the U.S.—the 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Power Project in New York State—is now fully operational. More than a milestone in renewable energy, this project marks the official launch of PowerBank’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. “This is a pivotal moment for PowerBank,” said Dr. Richard Lu, President and CEO. “Geddes isn’t just our largest U.S. asset—it’s our launchpad into a bold, dual-track strategy that fuses clean energy leadership with financial innovation. By deploying net cash generated by this project into Bitcoin, we are enhancing the value of our operating assets while aligning ourselves with a future-focused monetary reserve model.” A Strategic Inflection Point – Energy + Bitcoin: Pioneering Treasury Strategy. Geddes is the first of potentially several PowerBank projects to support a digital asset reserve model, giving the Company exposure to Bitcoin as a non-correlated, asymmetric upside asset. Financial Flexibility . This approach allows PowerBank to retain earnings from high-performance assets like Geddes in a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. Environmental Transformation . By converting a capped landfill into a clean power station, PowerBank demonstrates how sustainability and innovation can converge for long-term value creation. Scalability . The Company is actively assessing expansion of this Bitcoin treasury strategy across additional solar and battery energy storage projects in its IPP (Independent Power Producer) portfolio. The Geddes Solar Power Operation Built on a repurposed landfill, the Geddes Project now delivers 3.79 MW of clean, renewable energy — enough to power approximately 450 homes annually — while transforming an underutilized site into a productive asset. But its value extends beyond green power. Net cash flows from the project will be allocated, at management’s discretion, to the acquisition of Bitcoin, creating a hybrid strategy that blends energy generation with strategic digital asset investment. Capacity: 3.79 MW DC Type: Utility-scale ground-mounted solar Location: Former landfill site in Geddes, New York Off-take: Local grid, supporting community energy needs Impact: Powers approximately 450 homes annually Solar Simplified handles all customer-facing activities for the Company’s community solar projects, allowing it to focus on developing and expanding its renewable energy portfolio. Solar Simplified’s expertise in acquisition, enrollment, and management ensures full project subscription and maximized revenue from day one. With a business model that aligns seamlessly with the Company’s, this partnership drives sustainable growth, enabling the Company to accelerate development, bring more projects online each year, and create greater value for its business and the communities served by the Company. Additional Information: Bitcoin purchases will be funded through excess cash generated by the Geddes Project, after meeting all capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and operational requirements.

July 29th, 2025 – Toronto, Ontario, Canada class=”ql-align-justify”> PowerBank Corporation (NASDAQ: SUUN; Cboe CA: SUNN, FSE: 103) , a leader in distributed solar energy, battery storage, and clean energy infrastructure across North America, is excited to announce that its largest owned-and-operated asset in the U.S.—the 3.79 MW Geddes Solar Power Project in New York State—is now fully operational. More than a milestone in renewable energy, this project marks the official launch of PowerBank’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. “This is a pivotal moment for PowerBank,” said Dr. Richard Lu, President and CEO. “Geddes isn’t just our largest U.S. asset—it’s our launchpad into a bold, dual-track strategy that fuses clean energy leadership with financial innovation. By deploying net cash generated by this project into Bitcoin, we are enhancing the value of our operating assets while aligning ourselves with a future-focused monetary reserve model.” A Strategic Inflection Point – Energy + Bitcoin: Pioneering Treasury Strategy. Geddes is the first of potentially several PowerBank projects to support a digital asset reserve model, giving the Company exposure to Bitcoin as a non-correlated, asymmetric upside asset. Financial Flexibility . This approach allows PowerBank to retain earnings from high-performance assets like Geddes in a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. Environmental Transformation . By converting a capped landfill into a clean power station, PowerBank demonstrates how sustainability and innovation can converge for long-term value creation. Scalability . The Company is actively assessing expansion of this Bitcoin treasury strategy across additional solar and battery energy storage projects in its IPP (Independent Power Producer) portfolio. The Geddes Solar Power Operation Built on a repurposed landfill, the Geddes Project now delivers 3.79 MW of clean, renewable energy — enough to power approximately 450 homes annually — while transforming an underutilized site into a productive asset. But its value extends beyond green power. Net cash flows from the project will be allocated, at management’s discretion, to the acquisition of Bitcoin, creating a hybrid strategy that blends energy generation with strategic digital asset investment. Capacity: 3.79 MW DC Type: Utility-scale ground-mounted solar Location: Former landfill site in Geddes, New York Off-take: Local grid, supporting community energy needs Impact: Powers approximately 450 homes annually Solar Simplified handles all customer-facing activities for the Company’s community solar projects, allowing it to focus on developing and expanding its renewable energy portfolio. Solar Simplified’s expertise in acquisition, enrollment, and management ensures full project subscription and maximized revenue from day one. With a business model that aligns seamlessly with the Company’s, this partnership drives sustainable growth, enabling the Company to accelerate development, bring more projects online each year, and create greater value for its business and the communities served by the Company. Additional Information: Bitcoin purchases will be funded through excess cash generated by the Geddes Project, after meeting all capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and operational requirements.

Galaxy Digital Moves $447M in Bitcoin, Community on Edge In a latest development, on-chain data shows that Galaxy Digital has moved 3,782 Bitcoins worth $447 million to several wallets in the past 12 hours. The bulk of these transfers were to major crypto exchanges, which have sparked fears in the crypto community. Is Galaxy Digital all set to facilitate another round of Bitcoin selling?

Galaxy hasn’t released an official comment yet, but the size and timing of the transfers have sparked fresh speculation about a potential sale. Bitcoin Price Remains Stable, For Now Despite the noise, Bitcoin hasn’t moved much. It’s currently trading at $118,217, down just 0.4% in the past 24 hours. This is a sharp contrast to last week, when Galaxy moved $9 billion worth of BTC from a dormant wallet dating back to the Satoshi era, pushing prices briefly down to $116,000. The fact that Bitcoin held its ground this time shows more stability in the market, but investors remain cautious. Long-Term Holders Begin Taking Profits Near $120K A Cryptoquant analyst points out that long-term Bitcoin holders (LTHs) have turned net negative right as BTC approaches the key $120,000 resistance, which is a strong psychological level.

Or is it simply a strategic decision to cash in after Bitcoin’s strong rally? Whatever the case is, these actions could significantly shape Bitcoin’s direction in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin Top Could Be Weeks Away On-chain data shows Bitcoin might be near a cycle top. The MVRV 365DMA is showing a pattern like 2021, just before the last big drop. If the pattern repeats, the peak could come in late August or early September. This also lines up with market expectations around Fed policy and macro shifts. The next Bitcoin $BTC top could be at $149,679! pic.twitter.com/knZXTdjKve — Ali (@ali_charts) July 29, 2025 Analysts note that Bitcoin has once again closed the CME futures gap on Monday, marking the sixth week in a row.

More than a milestone in renewable energy, this project marks the official launch of PowerBank’s Bitcoin treasury strategy. “This is a pivotal moment for PowerBank,” said Dr. Richard Lu, President and CEO. “Geddes isn’t just our largest U.S. asset—it’s our launchpad into a bold, dual-track strategy that fuses clean energy leadership with financial innovation. By deploying net cash generated by this project into Bitcoin, we are enhancing the value of our operating assets while aligning ourselves with a future-focused monetary reserve model.” A Strategic Inflection Point – Energy + Bitcoin: Pioneering Treasury Strategy. Geddes is the first of potentially several PowerBank projects to support a digital asset reserve model, giving the Company exposure to Bitcoin as a non-correlated, asymmetric upside asset. Financial Flexibility. This approach allows PowerBank to retain earnings from high-performance assets like Geddes in a store of value with long-term appreciation potential. Environmental Transformation. By converting a capped landfill into a clean power station, PowerBank demonstrates how sustainability and innovation can converge for long-term value creation. Scalability. The Company is actively assessing expansion of this Bitcoin treasury strategy across additional solar and battery energy storage projects in its IPP (Independent Power Producer) portfolio. The Geddes Solar Power Operation Built on a repurposed landfill, the Geddes Project now delivers 3.79 MW of clean, renewable energy — enough to power approximately 450 homes annually — while transforming an underutilized site into a productive asset. But its value extends beyond green power. Net cash flows from the project will be allocated, at management’s discretion, to the acquisition of Bitcoin, creating a hybrid strategy that blends energy generation with strategic digital asset investment. Capacity: 3.79 MW DC Type: Utility-scale ground-mounted solar Location: Former landfill site in Geddes, New York Off-take: Local grid, supporting community energy needs Impact: Powers approximately 450 homes annually Solar Simplified handles all customer-facing activities for the Company’s community solar projects, allowing it to focus on developing and expanding its renewable energy portfolio. Solar Simplified’s expertise in acquisition, enrollment, and management ensures full project subscription and maximized revenue from day one. With a business model that aligns seamlessly with the Company’s, this partnership drives sustainable growth, enabling the Company to accelerate development, bring more projects online each year, and create greater value for its business and the communities served by the Company. Additional Information: Bitcoin purchases will be funded through excess cash generated by the Geddes Project, after meeting all capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and operational requirements. Timing, size, and frequency of purchases will be determined by market conditions, Bitcoin pricing, cash needs, and regulatory factors. No Bitcoin has been purchased as of the date of this release. Custody and security frameworks are currently under evaluation and will be finalized prior to any acquisitions.

The Cardano network has lagged in DeFi growth compared to its top competitors like Solana and Tron. The ADA/USD pair has signaled bullish sentiment following the recent rebound from 52 cents. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has issued a bold new price prediction for both his native token, ADA, and the market leader, Bitcoin (BTC). In a recent interview, Hoskinson stated that ADA might record a 100x or even 1000x gain, whereas Bitcoin’s price may only see a 10x increase in the near future. Hoskinson was responding to a question about why the Cardano treasury did not convert its ADA holdings to Bitcoin. He argued that Bitcoin’s massive $2.3 trillion valuation is a hindrance to its potential for high-percentage gains when compared to Cardano’s much smaller $29.1 billion market cap. “Oh sure, let’s sell ADA for Bitcoin. So we can make less money,” Hoskinson noted sarcastically. For context, a 100x for Cardano would give it a market cap of $2.9 trillion, while a 10x for Bitcoin would push its valuation to $23 trillion.

2025-07-29 12:40:10+00:00,Bitcoin Reserve Strategy: ZOOZ Power’s Bold $180M Move Unlocks Crypto Potential,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserve Strategy: ZOOZ Power’s Bold $180M Move Unlocks Crypto Potential The corporate world is increasingly turning its gaze towards digital assets, and ZOOZ Power is making headlines with its audacious plan to establish a significant Bitcoin Reserve Strategy . This isn’t just another funding round; it’s a strategic pivot that could redefine how companies manage their treasuries in the digital age. For anyone tracking the convergence of traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto market, this development from a Nasdaq-listed entity is nothing short of fascinating. ZOOZ Power’s Vision: Unpacking the Bold Bitcoin Reserve Strategy In a move that has captured the attention of both traditional and crypto investors, Nasdaq-listed ZOOZ Power has announced its intention to raise a substantial $180 million. This capital infusion isn’t for typical operational expansion; instead, it’s earmarked specifically to fund an ambitious Bitcoin Reserve Strategy . The funding will be secured through a Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) transaction, involving the issuance of 180 million ordinary shares and pre-funded warrants, each priced at $1.00. This significant financial maneuver is, however, contingent upon securing shareholder approval, underscoring the company’s commitment to transparency and governance in this pioneering endeavor. The decision to allocate such a considerable sum towards a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy signals a profound shift in corporate treasury management, moving beyond traditional fiat currencies and conventional investment vehicles. It reflects a growing recognition among forward-thinking companies of Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value, an inflation hedge, and a strategic asset in an increasingly digitized global economy. Why a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Now? Understanding the Motivation Why would a company like ZOOZ Power, primarily known for its ultra-fast electric vehicle charging solutions, venture into the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? The answer lies in a confluence of macroeconomic factors and a bold vision for the future of corporate finance. For years, companies have sought stable, high-yield assets for their treasury reserves. However, with persistent inflation concerns, low-interest rates on traditional holdings, and the unpredictable nature of global markets, many are seeking alternative strategies. A Bitcoin Reserve Strategy offers several compelling advantages: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a scarce asset, often dubbed ‘digital gold.’ This scarcity can protect purchasing power against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can diversify asset holdings, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk by introducing an asset class with a low correlation to traditional markets. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies an opportunity for substantial capital appreciation on their reserves. Innovation and Forward-Thinking: Adopting a Bitcoin Reserve Strategy positions a company as innovative and technologically savvy, appealing to a new generation of investors and talent. This move echoes the pioneering steps taken by companies like MicroStrategy, which famously adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating the viability and potential benefits of such a strategy for publicly traded companies. The Powerhouse Investors: Who’s Backing This Bold Bitcoin Reserve Strategy? The credibility of ZOOZ Power’s Bitcoin Reserve Strategy is significantly bolstered by the caliber of strategic investors participating in the PIPE offering. This isn’t just any group of investors; it’s a who’s who of prominent names in the cryptocurrency and venture capital space, signaling strong institutional confidence in the company’s new direction. Pantera Capital: A leading blockchain-focused investment firm, known for its early and significant investments in the crypto ecosystem. Their involvement speaks volumes about the perceived potential. FalconX: A prime brokerage for institutional crypto trading, their participation highlights the growing institutional demand for digital assets and the professional execution capabilities required for such a strategy. Arrington Capital: Founded by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, this firm is a well-respected name in blockchain and crypto investments, further validating the strategic shift.

2025-07-29 12:46:20+00:00,FDIG: The Underwhelming Underachiever,"Summary FDIG offers low expenses and diversified crypto equity exposure but lacks the asymmetric upside seen in top-performing peers like BLOK or pure Bitcoin. The ETF''s holdings are highly correlated with Bitcoin, benefiting from bull markets but also exposed to sharp drawdowns if sentiment reverses. FDIG''s construction prioritizes lower volatility, which limits participation in strong rallies and results in inferior risk-adjusted returns versus competitors. I rate FDIG a hold. For higher growth potential, investors should consider BLOK or direct Bitcoin exposure, as FDIG''s strategy is only optimal in a flat market. The Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ) is focused on companies in the cryptocurrency and blockchain technology industries. This fund recently caught my attention due to it having one of the lowest expense ratios in my constructed peer universe, but it ultimately failed to live up to my expectations for asymmetric upside. I rate this ETF a hold and will dissect why investors should avoid it in favor of some of its more attractive alternatives. Overview Despite being thematically linked to the crypto industry, FDIG tracks equities only. However, some of its largest holdings, such as Coinbase ( COIN ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), exhibit a strong positive correlation to the movement of Bitcoin. FDIG holds a mix of both pure crypto plays in the form of miners and exchanges, as well as enablers in the form of payment and fintech businesses with strong Bitcoin exposure. These companies comprise the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments Index , which is rules-based and passively managed. In order for equities to be selected into the index, companies must have a market cap of over $100 million and have a $2 million daily trading volume. Chinese stocks are not included in the index. Additionally, companies must have more than 50% of their revenues generated from the crypto industry, be it in the form of mining, custody, blockchain infrastructure, or digital payments. Stocks are weighted in the index by their modified average daily trading volume ((ADV)). This means that companies are prioritized for their liquidity rather than market cap. As is common with a thematic ETF, its holdings are fairly concentrated, with its top 10 holdings accounting for 69.32% of its total portfolio. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.40% as well as a dividend yield of 0.97%. Seeking Alpha Outlook FDIG looks attractive at first glance. The fund has a P/E of 24.74. This is contrasted with substantial EPS growth forecasts for its top six holdings, with an average expected jump in EPS of 32.03% and a median increase of 28.84%. Thus, from the perspective of price/earnings-to-growth, its attractively priced relative to its forward growth potential.

During bull markets such as today, traders spend more on fees, mining is more profitable, and more users are attracted to the utility of digital payments. FDIG has a positive correlation to Bitcoin''s price, so what Bitcoin does next can be reasonably assumed to be a leading indicator for the fund''s performance moving forward. Data by YCharts Bitcoin is cyclical and is presently in a strong bull run. Analysts estimate that we''re between 640 and 975 days into the upwards cycle. Based on historical patterns before a correction arrives, bull cycles have lasted around 1,000 to 1,200 days. The consensus from analysts suggests that we''re currently mid-to-late in Bitcoin''s current bull cycle, which suggests that Bitcoin could peak sometime between October this year and mid-2026 at the latest. This suggests that we are not yet at the peak, and that there is real upside still left to be gained while Bitcoin remains structurally strong. There may be a lack of a strong, obvious catalyst on the horizon for Bitcoin (such as an upcoming halving event, next due in 2028), but there are still some clear and powerful structural elements that I believe will sustain its upward trajectory. Trump and Vance''s White House administration are explicitly backing Bitcoin through proposed reserve allocations as well as through the GENIUS Act and market structure bills. Then there''s also the continued dedollarisation in countries like China, Russia, and Iran, which helped to ignite gold''s historic rally over the past year, driven by central bank purchases. As tensions rise between the U.S. and its rivals, I foresee that U.S. treasuries will continue to be sold in favor of alternative assets, which opens the door for Bitcoin to be more heavily considered.

This policy is widely seen as adding further pressure to the global economy, particularly amid ongoing challenges like high inflation and consumer spending contraction. Economists are concerned that this new round of tariffs could disrupt global supply chains and negatively impact traditional investment markets, such as real estate, gold, and stocks. As a result, investors are increasingly turning to the cryptocurrency sector to explore alternative assets with greater resilience to market volatility. In July, the U.S. government officially approved a policy allowing pension funds to allocate investments to cryptocurrency assets. This decision not only legitimizes the crypto market for compliant funds but also signals the U.S.’s shift toward becoming a global hub for crypto finance. Analysts suggest this policy could unlock hundreds of billions of dollars in potential investment, providing long-term upward momentum for major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP.

This isn’t science fiction; it’s a future that financial titan BlackRock is keenly observing. Recently, BlackRock strategists made a compelling statement: the right kind of stablecoin rules , specifically a framework like the U.S. GENIUS Act, could significantly strengthen the U.S. dollar’s global standing. For anyone tracking the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto space, this perspective from one of the world’s largest asset managers is nothing short of fascinating. BlackRock’s Bold Prediction: Could Stablecoin Rules Truly Boost the Dollar? When BlackRock speaks, the financial world listens. Their recent insights, as reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, suggest that a well-structured regulatory framework for dollar-pegged stablecoins could be a game-changer for the U.S. dollar. This isn’t just about making crypto more accessible; it’s about fundamentally enhancing the dollar’s utility and reach on a global scale. But how exactly would stablecoin rules achieve such a profound impact? The core of BlackRock’s argument rests on two pivotal mechanisms: Enabling a Tokenized Payment System: Imagine a digital infrastructure where transactions are not only instantaneous but also significantly cheaper and more efficient. Stablecoins, particularly those firmly pegged to the U.S. dollar and operating under clear regulations, could power such a system. This would streamline cross-border payments, trade finance, and even everyday consumer transactions, making the dollar more fluid and functional than ever before. Easier Access for Emerging Markets: For countries grappling with volatile local currencies, access to a stable, reliable medium of exchange is critical. U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, governed by robust stablecoin rules , offer a digital gateway to the dollar. This provides a lifeline for businesses and individuals in emerging economies, allowing them to participate more securely in the global economy without the constant threat of hyperinflation or currency depreciation. The GENIUS Act: What Does This Regulatory Framework Mean for the Future of Money? The U.S. GENIUS Act (Generating Innovative New Ideas for the United States Act), though still in legislative discussions, represents a significant step towards formalizing the regulatory landscape for stablecoins. It aims to provide clarity and oversight, crucial elements for institutional adoption and widespread public trust. BlackRock’s focus on this specific framework highlights the importance of thoughtful, comprehensive stablecoin rules that can foster innovation while mitigating risks. A well-defined regulatory environment would offer: Aspect Impact of Clear Stablecoin Rules Consumer Protection Safeguards against fraud and mismanagement, building public confidence. Financial Stability Ensuring stablecoin reserves are fully backed and transparent, preventing systemic risks. Market Integrity Preventing illicit activities like money laundering and terrorist financing. Innovation & Competition Providing a clear runway for companies to develop new products and services using stablecoins. Without clear stablecoin rules , the potential for these digital assets to truly integrate into the global financial system remains limited. The GENIUS Act, or similar legislation, is seen as essential for unlocking the dollar’s full digital potential. Beyond Borders: How Stablecoin Rules Could Empower Emerging Economies? One of the most profound impacts of robust stablecoin rules , as highlighted by BlackRock, lies in their ability to empower emerging markets. Many developing nations face persistent challenges with currency instability, which can cripple economic growth, deter foreign investment, and erode the savings of ordinary citizens. In such environments, accessing a stable currency like the U.S. dollar is paramount, but traditional banking channels can be slow, costly, and inaccessible to many. Stablecoins offer a compelling alternative: Reduced Transaction Costs: Sending remittances or making international payments can be prohibitively expensive through traditional banking systems. Stablecoins facilitate cheaper, faster transfers. Inflation Hedge: For individuals and businesses in countries with high inflation, holding dollar-pegged stablecoins can protect their purchasing power. Greater Financial Inclusion: Stablecoins can be accessed via mobile phones, potentially reaching millions who are unbanked or underbanked in remote areas, providing them with a digital gateway to global finance.

2025-07-29 13:08:17+00:00,"Hong Kong Finalizes Stablecoin Rules Effective Aug. 1, Warns Against Hype as Licensing Delayed to 2026","The post Hong Kong Finalizes Stablecoin Rules Effective Aug. 1, Warns Against Hype as Licensing Delayed to 2026 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city’s de facto central bank, has finalized its regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, publishing two sets of guidelines that will come into effect on August 1. While the framework is now in place, the HKMA is expected to issue the first batch of stablecoin licences in early 2026, and has called on potential issuers to submit their applications by the end of September. Hong Kong Pushes Following Genius Act On Tuesday, the HKMA released finalized guidelines and consultation conclusions outlining upcoming rules for stablecoin oversight. The documents cover supervision of licensed issuers, as well as AML and CTF requirements. As part of the new framework, Hong Kong will also launch a public registry of licensed stablecoin issuers. “In the future, the public may refer to the register of licensed stablecoin issuers as shown on the HKMA’s website,” the regulator said. At a media briefing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said the city’s stablecoin regulations will take effect this Friday, August 1. However, the first licences for stablecoin issuers are now expected to be granted in early 2026. Many in the market had hoped the licences would be issued this year, but the HKMA’s comments suggest it’s taking a more cautious approach.

The post Hong Kong Finalizes Stablecoin Rules Effective Aug. 1, Warns Against Hype as Licensing Delayed to 2026 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the city’s de facto central bank, has finalized its regulatory framework for stablecoin issuers, publishing two sets of guidelines that will come into effect on August 1. While the framework is now in place, the HKMA is expected to issue the first batch of stablecoin licences in early 2026, and has called on potential issuers to submit their applications by the end of September. Hong Kong Pushes Following Genius Act On Tuesday, the HKMA released finalized guidelines and consultation conclusions outlining upcoming rules for stablecoin oversight. The documents cover supervision of licensed issuers, as well as AML and CTF requirements. As part of the new framework, Hong Kong will also launch a public registry of licensed stablecoin issuers. “In the future, the public may refer to the register of licensed stablecoin issuers as shown on the HKMA’s website,” the regulator said. At a media briefing, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) said the city’s stablecoin regulations will take effect this Friday, August 1. However, the first licences for stablecoin issuers are now expected to be granted in early 2026. Many in the market had hoped the licences would be issued this year, but the HKMA’s comments suggest it’s taking a more cautious approach. The regulator added, “Considering Hong Kong’s well-established systems, we do not expect to achieve large-scale (stablecoin adoption) immediately in the early stages. Instead, we aim to progress step by step, gradually driving the digital transformation of Hong Kong.” The HKMA is encouraging anyone interested in applying for a stablecoin license to get in touch with the regulator by August 1.

In a presale launch that defied expectations and shattered norms, Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU) raised a staggering $187,000 within the first 90 seconds of going live. Just 24 hours in, it has already crossed $1 million — and it’s still climbing fast. In a market that’s itching for its next breakout star, BPENGU has emerged with perfect timing. With Bitcoin trading near $119,000, only a few thousand dollars below its all-time high, and penguin-themed assets like Pudgy Penguins soaring over 200% in the past month, the appetite for meme-fueled upside is very real. But BPENGU isn’t just another meme coin chasing the hype. It’s positioning itself as a smarter, faster, Bitcoin-native evolution of what Pudgy Penguins helped start. Why BPENGU has captured the market’s imagination Data on its website shows the momentum is real: over $1 million raised in a day. And that’s not just a sign of strong demand — it’s validation of the project’s hybrid appeal. BPENGU blends the cultural firepower of meme tokens with the credibility of Bitcoin’s infrastructure. While Pudgy Penguins operates on Ethereum, Bitcoin Penguins is built on Bitcoin itself — setting it apart in a space where most meme coins are purely speculative. The team is also targeting a $2 price by November, which would mark a 1,000% gain from presale levels and put the project at a $1 billion fully diluted valuation. A presale with precision and urgency The structure behind the hype is just as compelling. The BPENGU presale spans 15 fixed stages, with the token price climbing 5% at each step. Early buyers can lock in up to 75% in notional gains before the token even lists. There’s no open-ended fundraising, no indefinite wait. The presale ends August 27, or sooner if the $10 million cap is reached. The claim and listing date is already set for September 2 — giving investors something rare: transparency and trust. The next price jump kicks in within 24 hours, turning up the heat on an already fast-moving sale. Could the Fed be the catalyst? All eyes are on this week’s Fed meeting, where policymakers are widely expected to hold interest rates steady. That signal of stability could help propel Bitcoin higher — and meme coins like BPENGU even further. With Bitcoin near record highs, memes back in style, and penguin mania running wild, BPENGU is doing what most tokens can’t: backing up its hype with real momentum, structure, and timing.

2025-07-29 13:22:32+00:00,"RAKBANK introduces dirham-based crypto trading via app, joins UAE’s fintech push","RAKBANK has taken a significant step toward mainstreaming cryptocurrency in the United Arab Emirates by enabling customers to trade digital assets directly through its mobile app. This new feature eliminates the need for conversions to foreign currencies or reliance on offshore platforms, marking the first such move by a traditional UAE bank. In partnership with Bitpanda, a Europe-based crypto platform, the bank is offering buy, sell, and swap services in dirhams, providing a fully localised and regulated crypto experience. The move aligns with the UAE’s broader fintech strategy to become a digital asset hub and provides residents with a simplified entry point into crypto markets. Until now, users were largely dependent on international platforms such as Binance or Coinbase, where they had to convert AED to USD and navigate fees and cross-border regulatory risks. RAKBANK’s new offering allows users to bypass those steps entirely. Bitpanda’s regulated entry reinforces trust Bitpanda Broker MENA DMCC, a subsidiary of Austria-headquartered Bitpanda, is powering the back-end of this service. The firm is regulated under Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and is already partnered with key financial institutions in Europe, including Deutsche Bank and Raiffeisen Bank. Its integration into RAKBANK’s ecosystem adds regulatory credibility and technological infrastructure to the offering. While the service is currently accessible by invitation only, the bank plans to expand access in the coming months. Supported tokens at launch include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP), with more assets to be added progressively. Trades are executed and settled entirely in AED, and users can access crypto directly from their savings or current accounts without leaving the RAKBANK platform. Local banking meets global crypto innovation RAKBANK’s launch represents a significant shift in how banks and consumers interact with digital assets in the region. Prior to this, access to cryptocurrency typically involved third-party platforms outside local regulatory jurisdiction. These platforms required foreign currency exchanges and often lacked integration with users’ primary banking services. By embedding crypto access directly into its mobile banking app, RAKBANK removes key barriers to adoption, especially for users who prefer the security and familiarity of a regulated local institution. This could signal a broader shift in banking behaviour, where traditional financial players begin to integrate digital asset services to stay competitive and meet evolving consumer expectations. UAE builds momentum in digital assets RAKBANK’s move comes as Dubai and the broader UAE continue their aggressive push into the digital asset space. The Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) free zone is already home to more than 600 crypto-related firms. The government has also greenlit several major projects, including the issuance of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. By launching this feature, RAKBANK positions itself at the forefront of banking innovation in the region. Its crypto service could potentially serve as a blueprint for other local institutions exploring entry into the digital assets market. The full rollout is expected to be closely watched, not only by consumers but also by regulatory and banking circles across the Gulf.

However, it has been unable to sustain above $120,000 and continues to consolidate between $110,000 and $120,000. While it remains unclear which direction Bitcoin will move, one analyst noted that the BTC premium on Coinbase has turned negative for the first time since late May, which could be a sign that the correction is continuing. According to Coindesk, market analyst Omkar Godbole noted that the Coinbase BTC premium, a key indicator of demand from US investors, has turned negative after a historic 60-day run. Bitcoin has been trading at a higher price on Coinbase than on Binance for the past 60 days. This typically indicates strong buying interest from US investors, particularly large institutions. However, this premium has now reversed for the first time since late May, and Bitcoin is cheaper on Coinbase than on Binance. At this point, the analyst said that the Coinbase BTC premium turning negative for the first time since the end of May indicates that the buying pressure from US investors has decreased. According to the analyst, this signals a significant shift in market dynamics. US investor demand is weakening, and as a result, Bitcoin''s correction could continue. Summer Stagnation in Bitcoin! Apart from this, the crypto analysis platform Matrixport also made a similar analysis. Matrixport analysts stated that stagnation will prevail in the BTC price due to the historical summer months recession. At this point, analysts stated that with no significant catalyst expected in August and investor participation decreasing, Bitcoin could enter a short-term correction or move sideways. “Trading volume is likely to decline further in August due to the absence of specific catalysts and the traditional holiday season, which sees reduced retail investor participation. Therefore, we predict that Bitcoin may enter a short-term correction or sideways trend.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bad News from Analysts: Bitcoin Correction May Extend!

Matrixport analysts stated that stagnation will prevail in the BTC price due to the historical summer months recession. At this point, analysts stated that with no significant catalyst expected in August and investor participation decreasing, Bitcoin could enter a short-term correction or move sideways. “Trading volume is likely to decline further in August due to the absence of specific catalysts and the traditional holiday season, which sees reduced retail investor participation. Therefore, we predict that Bitcoin may enter a short-term correction or sideways trend.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bad News from Analysts: Bitcoin Correction May Extend!

2025-07-29 13:23:19+00:00,Crypto Mining Blamed for Up to 20% of Iran’s Power Imbalance,"Iranian officials have raised concerns over the rising strain crypto mining is placing on the nation’s electricity grid, claiming that the activity now contributes to as much as 20% of the country’s energy imbalance. Key Takeaways: Iranian officials say crypto mining now contributes up to 20% of the country’s electricity shortfall. Over 900,000 illegal mining devices were recently shut down during a nationwide internet outage. Authorities are ramping up enforcement, seizing over 250,000 unauthorized rigs across multiple provinces. Speaking on Monday, Mohammad Allahdad, deputy head of Iran’s state-run power company Tavanir, said crypto mining operations are consuming nearly 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity, equivalent to the output of two Bushehr nuclear reactors. Although this represents just 5% of the country’s overall consumption, the impact on Iran’s current energy deficit is far more severe. Crypto Mining Fuels 20% of Iran’s Power Shortfall, Says Official “Crypto mining now accounts for up to 20% of the shortfall in our electricity grid,” Allahdad stated, describing the figure as both significant and alarming. He cited data from a recent nationwide internet outage linked to the conflict with Israel, which caused power usage to drop by 2,400 MW, largely due to the shutdown of over 900,000 unauthorized mining devices. The strain is being felt most acutely during Iran’s scorching summer, when power demand spikes due to widespread use of air conditioning, agricultural operations, and industrial production. Allahdad warned that illegal mining during peak hours can lead to voltage drops, equipment damage, and even fires caused by the heat generated by the machines. Authorities have discovered that many mining farms are hidden in abandoned homes , warehouses, or unused industrial buildings. Tavanir has launched a public reporting initiative, offering rewards of up to 200 million tomans (around $2,300) to individuals who report unauthorized mining activity. Hadi Sefidmou, who heads Iran’s crypto mining oversight task force, added that producing one Bitcoin with outdated equipment can consume up to one million kilowatt-hours—equivalent to the annual electricity use of 440 Iranian households. Even with newer hardware, each mining unit still consumes as much power as 12 homes. About 1 in every 32 Bitcoin may be mined in Iran According to some reports, Iran may account for ~3.1% of global BTC mining. Why?

More than 250,000 illegal miners have been seized across multiple provinces, including Tehran, Isfahan, Fars, and East Azarbaijan. Just this week, 108 rigs were discovered in an abandoned Ahvaz factory, while another bust in Alborz province uncovered 168 unauthorized devices between March and June. With electricity demand now exceeding 70,000 MW, officials say addressing illicit mining is no longer optional. Chinese Roots Still Dominate Global Bitcoin Mining As reported, over half of the world’s Bitcoin mining operations still trace their origins to China , with 55% to 65% of mining linked to Chinese capital, hardware, or expertise, according to Uminers CEO Batyr Hydyrov. Despite China’s 2021 mining ban, key Chinese players have maintained influence by relocating operations overseas. Major Chinese manufacturers Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, responsible for 99% of Bitcoin mining hardware, have shifted production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, helping boost America’s share of Bitcoin’s total hashrate from 4% in 2019 to 38% today. Hydyrov added that former Chinese miners have often increased capacity after moving abroad, with some expanding by up to 150%, and noted that limited mining still persists within China’s remote regions where enforcement is lax.

BitMine has been extremely bullish on ETH, suggesting the token may rise as far as $60,000 if the bull market continues. Ethereum has grown its activity, mostly due to increased demand for stablecoin transfers. BitMine is one of the most ambitious and aggressive ETH buyers, aiming to control up to 5% of the token’s supply.

The company has $401.4M in unencumbered cash, with $22.76 net asset value per share from a mix of cash and crypto. BitMine retains 154 BTC in its earlier treasury, with a total of $2.7B in crypto assets. Following the initial pivot to an ETH treasury, BMNR shares sank to a lower baseline. Currently, BMNR trades at a one-month low of $35.11, down from a local peak of $135.01 in early July. The stock’s volatility allows for repurchases at a lower range.

2025-07-29 13:25:54+00:00,Altcoin Momentum Builds as Market Fragility Rises: Bitfinex Alpha,"Over the past few weeks, crypto investors have been rotating their capital from bitcoin (BTC) into altcoins. That trend has not stopped. In fact, the market is witnessing a growing risk appetite among traders. According to a weekly report by the crypto exchange Bitfinex, this trend is also evident in open interest ratios. Investors are deploying high leverage on volatile assets. As this dynamic of excessive speculation continues to build beneath the surface, the market structure becomes weaker and more vulnerable to liquidation cascades. Altcoin Momentum Builds Bitcoin remains structurally strong, but its open interest dominance is declining. This metric has fallen from 51% to 41% in three months, signaling a shift in trader positioning within the derivatives landscape. Within this period, Ethereum’s open interest dominance has risen from 17% to 26% and altcoins have seen their dominance remain stable in the low 30s. This growth reflects renewed interest in ether (ETH) amid improving narratives. This season is driven by capital rotation between different altcoins, speculative surges, and continuous listings on major exchanges. Traders are now looking beyond BTC to capture gains in ETH and trending cryptocurrencies. While this dynamic is favorable for the altcoin sector in the short term, it introduces greater systemic fragility, with fragmented capital across volatile assets. Analysts say this can amplify liquidation events, making the market vulnerable to sharp reversals and exaggerated volatility. “If momentum stalls or unexpected macro or regulatory news emerges, this leverage can unwind rapidly, potentially exacerbating downside moves across the altcoin complex,” Bitfinex analysts said, adding that risk management is increasingly important at this market phase. Market Becomes More Fragile Furthermore, the ratio of altcoin to BTC liquidations has increased. As BTC witnessed a sharp decline between July 23 and 25, the trend was magnified across altcoins. The market saw $1.46 billion in long liquidations, with BTC alone accounting for $370 million. Although the impact of this plunge was modest on BTC, leveraged traders took a significant hit. With $1.1 billion wiped out in long liquidations, Bitfinex says the market has become overcrowded on the long side. Meanwhile, the market is already highly sensitive to volatility, as seen in daily liquidations over the last 30 days. Analysts found that average daily liquidations have exceeded $350 million across both long and short positions in the last four weeks.

2025-07-29 13:30:00+00:00,Truth Social Bitcoin ETF Faces New SEC Delay,"The proposed ETF is the first tied to a US president''s business interests, which raised many ethical concerns among lawmakers about potential conflicts of interest. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley even flagged past Trump-affiliated crypto deals as possible corruption risks. The SEC also postponed decisions on other crypto funds, including Grayscale’s Solana Trust and Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF. SEC Slows Down Trump ETF Plan The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed its decision on the Truth Social Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is backed by the Trump Media and Technology Group. This means the regulator extended the review deadline from Aug. 4 to Sept. 18. (Source: SEC ) The ETF seeks approval to list on NYSE Arca under the SEC’s commodity-based trust share rules, joining a growing roster of digital asset funds under review. The SEC explained that the extension is to allow more time for evaluation, a common move given the agency''s statutory ability to take up to 270 days to make a final determination on ETF applications. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF is unique for its ties to President Donald Trump, which makes it the first proposed crypto ETF connected to a sitting or former US president’s business interests. While no formal objections have been raised so far by the SEC, Trump’s increasing involvement in the crypto industry has caused some serious ethical concerns. In particular, Democrats questioned whether Trump could benefit personally from regulatory decisions affecting crypto markets or firms affiliated with his ventures. This concern is amplified by previous deals involving Trump-linked companies like World Liberty Financial, Binance, and a UAE firm, which were flagged by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley as potential channels for foreign corruption and conflicts of interest. Markley and Warren questioning Trump’s crypto ties (Source: US Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs ) The SEC also delayed decisions on Grayscale’s Solana Trust and Canary Capital’s proposed Litecoin ETF, and extended their deadlines to Oct. 10. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is very well known for her pro-crypto views, recently urged market participants to stay patient, due to ongoing litigation and internal complexities. Despite this, the pace of current ETF decisions is still quick when compared to historical norms. In fact, it took over a decade for the SEC to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in January of 2024. Trump has been highly active in crypto policy. On July 18, he signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first comprehensive US regulatory framework for stablecoins. Weeks earlier, on June 25, his appointee to the Federal Housing Finance Administration, William J.

Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley even flagged past Trump-affiliated crypto deals as possible corruption risks. The SEC also postponed decisions on other crypto funds, including Grayscale’s Solana Trust and Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF. SEC Slows Down Trump ETF Plan The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) postponed its decision on the Truth Social Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), which is backed by the Trump Media and Technology Group. This means the regulator extended the review deadline from Aug. 4 to Sept. 18. (Source: SEC ) The ETF seeks approval to list on NYSE Arca under the SEC’s commodity-based trust share rules, joining a growing roster of digital asset funds under review. The SEC explained that the extension is to allow more time for evaluation, a common move given the agency''s statutory ability to take up to 270 days to make a final determination on ETF applications. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF is unique for its ties to President Donald Trump, which makes it the first proposed crypto ETF connected to a sitting or former US president’s business interests. While no formal objections have been raised so far by the SEC, Trump’s increasing involvement in the crypto industry has caused some serious ethical concerns. In particular, Democrats questioned whether Trump could benefit personally from regulatory decisions affecting crypto markets or firms affiliated with his ventures. This concern is amplified by previous deals involving Trump-linked companies like World Liberty Financial, Binance, and a UAE firm, which were flagged by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley as potential channels for foreign corruption and conflicts of interest. Markley and Warren questioning Trump’s crypto ties (Source: US Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs ) The SEC also delayed decisions on Grayscale’s Solana Trust and Canary Capital’s proposed Litecoin ETF, and extended their deadlines to Oct. 10. Commissioner Hester Peirce, who is very well known for her pro-crypto views, recently urged market participants to stay patient, due to ongoing litigation and internal complexities. Despite this, the pace of current ETF decisions is still quick when compared to historical norms. In fact, it took over a decade for the SEC to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF in January of 2024. Trump has been highly active in crypto policy. On July 18, he signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first comprehensive US regulatory framework for stablecoins. Weeks earlier, on June 25, his appointee to the Federal Housing Finance Administration, William J. Pulte, issued a directive that could allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to treat unconverted crypto assets as eligible for mortgage underwriting."

2025-07-29 13:39:17+00:00,Ethereum Price Analysis: How Close Is ETH to Breaking Above $4K?,"Ethereum’s price is very close to making a new high in 2025, following Bitcoin’s recent record-breaking run. However, there are some signs of caution, as the market might be overheated, as momentum indicators suggest. Therefore, while the market structure is still bullish, this might not be a good time to buy ETH due to its riskiness. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart As the daily chart shows, ETH’s price has been rallying aggressively since its rebound from the $2,100 support level. It has since broken above both the 100-day and 200-day moving averages. These daily MAs, located around the $2,600 mark, have created a bullish crossover, further solidifying the bullish structure of the market. However, there are some reasons for concern. As evident, the RSI indicator has been in the overbought region for a while now, and is also demonstrating a clear bearish divergence with the price’s recent highs. In this case, a pullback to the $3,300 support zone could precede a potential breakout above the previous high around $4,107. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming in on the 4-hour chart, an interesting price action pattern is forming just below the key $4,000 resistance level. The ascending channel currently trapping the price inside is mostly a reversal pattern if broken to the downside. Therefore, the lower boundary of the channel, located around the $3,500 short-term support level, is now the most critical area the buyers should defend. On the other hand, a breakout above the pattern could initiate a significant rally, as it would go against technical expectations. Therefore, investors should watch out for a potentially explosive run if the channel gets broken to the upside, as it would mean that the recent consolidation was an accumulation phase, not a distribution by the smart money. On-Chain Analysis Ethereum Fund Holdings The latest data on Ethereum fund holdings shows a sharp and sustained increase, reaching over 5.3 million ETH, marking the highest level ever recorded. This metric reflects the total amount of ETH held by institutions through vehicles like ETFs, trusts, and crypto-focused funds. The rise suggests growing institutional confidence in Ethereum, likely fueled by its improving price structure, growing narrative around ETH ETFs, and the broader appetite for regulated, indirect exposure to crypto assets. Notably, this surge in holdings has closely followed Ethereum’s breakout above $3,000, reinforcing the idea that institutions are stepping in during periods of strength, not just weakness. The chart also shows how closely fund holdings align with price trends. When Ethereum sold off sharply earlier this year, fund holdings declined, but they began recovering aggressively alongside the price from May onward. This behavior indicates that institutions are becoming more active in responding to market momentum rather than just accumulating during downturns. If this trend continues, rising fund holdings could add a steady source of demand and act as a tailwind for Ethereum in the coming weeks, especially as more investors seek exposure through structured, regulated products rather than direct crypto purchases.

2025-07-29 13:51:52+00:00,Algeria riases threat of fines and prison time in blanket ban of crypto operations,"Authorities in Algeria are digging in their heels in their push to prohibit almost any activity related to cryptocurrencies with new legislation targeting specific transactions. An update of the Algerian law on combating money laundering introduces harsh punishment for various operations with digital assets, including monetary penalties and prison terms. Algeria turns back on Bitcoin, closing all doors for cryptos Recent legislative amendments, an attempt to eradicate rather than regulate crypto, have been described as a “thunderbolt hitting cryptocurrencies in Algeria” by the local Algerie360 portal which, detailing the changes, concluded: “In a decision without appeal, the country turns its back permanently on any form of use, creation or exchange of virtual currencies.” The news outlet referred to a bill revising Algeria’s anti-money laundering (AML) rules. The updated legislation, which went into effect with its publication in the North African nation’s Official Journal on July 24, is quite repressive against digital assets and their users. It adds “radical” provisions concerning specific operations with cryptocurrencies that amount to a zero-tolerance policy regarding a list of crypto-related activities and transactions, the report warned. In its latest version, the law completely bans the “issuance of virtual assets of all kinds; their purchase, sale or possession; their use as a means of payment or investment; their promotion or advertising in any form.” Under its new Article 6, the establishment and operation of platforms providing exchange or wallet services for cryptocurrencies have been prohibited as well. In essence, this means that merely holding decentralized digital money like Bitcoin or even fiat-pegged stablecoins like those issued by Tether can now be interpreted as a crime in the country, the publication highlighted, elaborating: “Behind this reform, the authorities intend to close the door to a universe perceived as opaque, unstable and out of control at a time when unregulated uses of cryptocurrencies are multiplying on a global scale.” Algerians risk fines and jail if they do anything with cryptocurrencies The Algerian government has been consistent in its hostile attitude towards cryptocurrencies. Its Financial Law from 2018 banned their use until at least 2025. But amid high inflation and strict state controls on capital flows, many citizens of the Arab country continued to engage in crypto transactions, often of a peer-to-peer nature or involving foreign platforms. The authorities in Algiers have also refused to legally recognize Bitcoin and the like to any extent, despite their popularity, leaving many Algerians vulnerable to prosecution and without any protection as consumers and investors. While the financial act from a few years ago did list some crypto activities, including the purchase, sale and possession of “virtual currency,” it wasn’t nearly as specific as the new texts in the AML law. The same applies to penalties for breaking the rules. According to Article 31a, offenders may be fined between 200,000 and 1 million Algerian dinars (almost $7,700), receive a prison sentence of up to 1 year, or get both, depending on the severity of their crime. The sanctions are obviously tailored to dissuade any potential use of cryptocurrencies within the government’s broader attempt to increase state control over the national financial system while consolidating Algeria ’s financial market. Other countries with restrictive crypto policies in the region include Egypt , its largest economy, where the central bank has issued repeated warnings about cryptocurrencies but, nevertheless, allowed some platforms to continue to operate. Neighboring Morocco banned digital asset transactions in 2017, citing concerns over financial crimes and potential negative effects on economic stability. However, its monetary authority has since recognized the wide spread of the digital assets and drafted a law to regulate them.

Key Takeaways: D2X has raised €4.3M to expand its institutional crypto derivatives platform. The exchange operates under a MiFID-regulated license. D2X offers seven-day trading for BTC and ETH futures. The capital injection will fuel product development and support onboarding for institutional clients seeking a regulated path into crypto derivatives trading, according to a report from Silicon Canals . “With its MTF license and weekend-ready architecture, D2X addresses two major gaps in Europe: regulated venues and access to 24/7 crypto markets,” said Charlie Sandor, Investment Partner at CMT Digital. “We’re proud to support a team that’s setting a new benchmark for institutional crypto trading.” D2X Secures Follow-On Support from Point72, Tioga, GSR, and Fortino The round also drew participation from existing investors including Point72 Ventures, Tioga Capital, GSR, and Fortino Capital. It follows D2X’s €9.1 million Series A funding raised in 2023, which coincided with the exchange becoming the first in the EU to receive a MiFID-compliant Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) license for crypto derivatives, granted by the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). Founded by Theodore Rozencwajg, Don van der Krogt, and Laetitia Grimaud, D2X is focused exclusively on institutional-grade crypto derivatives. The company’s product lineup currently includes USD- and EUR-denominated Bitcoin and Ethereum futures, with options trading expected to launch shortly. Its infrastructure supports seven-day trading while remaining fully compliant with MiFID II regulations, a model designed to mirror the around-the-clock nature of crypto markets while offering the safeguards traditional financial institutions expect.

Coinbase Launches Regulated Perpetual Futures for US Retail Traders Last week, Coinbase introduced CFTC-regulated nano Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures , giving US retail traders access to up to 10x leverage within a compliant onshore framework. Offered through Coinbase Financial Markets, the contracts come with low taker fees starting at 0.02% and replicate traditional perps, featuring five-year expirations and hourly funding rates. Settled in USD, the new products trade 24/7 and aim to bring U.S. users back from offshore platforms. Perpetual futures dominate global crypto derivatives trading, but American traders have long been pushed to riskier offshore venues due to regulatory hurdles. Coinbase’s launch marks a shift, providing legal access to leverage while aligning with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) standards. The move is part of a broader trend as US exchanges , including Kraken, ramp up their regulated derivatives offerings.

Its infrastructure supports seven-day trading while remaining fully compliant with MiFID II regulations, a model designed to mirror the around-the-clock nature of crypto markets while offering the safeguards traditional financial institutions expect. D2X $5M Strategic Round About: D2X is a platform that provides trading of cryptocurrency derivatives. Investors: @GSR_io , @CMT_Digital , @circle_ventures , @TiogaCapital , @p72vc , and @FortinoCapital https://t.co/26auSn7Vep pic.twitter.com/4ahpKXQcwR — Fundraising Digest (@CryptoRank_VCs) July 29, 2025 The firm’s latest launch, USD-based futures for BTC and ETH, caters to growing institutional demand for dollar-settled instruments in a regulatory-compliant setting. “This funding allows us to enhance our product suite and accelerate the onboarding of Tier-1 institutions,” said Rozencwajg. “We’re building for those who require a trusted, transparent, and regulated trading venue.” With MiFID-regulated status, real-time USD exposure, and a compliance-first approach, D2X is positioning itself as a European leader in institutional crypto derivatives. Coinbase Launches Regulated Perpetual Futures for US Retail Traders Last week, Coinbase introduced CFTC-regulated nano Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures , giving US retail traders access to up to 10x leverage within a compliant onshore framework. Offered through Coinbase Financial Markets, the contracts come with low taker fees starting at 0.02% and replicate traditional perps, featuring five-year expirations and hourly funding rates. Settled in USD, the new products trade 24/7 and aim to bring U.S. users back from offshore platforms. Perpetual futures dominate global crypto derivatives trading, but American traders have long been pushed to riskier offshore venues due to regulatory hurdles. Coinbase’s launch marks a shift, providing legal access to leverage while aligning with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) standards. The move is part of a broader trend as US exchanges , including Kraken, ramp up their regulated derivatives offerings.

From treasury strategies to bullish price targets, it is getting serious attention from corporate and financial players. As per a recent report from Standard Chartered, institutional treasuries now hold around 1% of ETH’s total circulating supply. But that’s just the beginning. The bank believes that this could grow tenfold, with businesses eventually holding up to 10% of ETH’s total supply.

The ETH/BTC ratio has jumped from 0.018 in April to 0.032 in July. Geoff Kendrick, analyst at Standard Chartered, notes that this could spark the start of a bigger shift, where institutions begin favoring Ethereum more heavily in their digital asset portfolios, even over Bitcoin. Is ETH More Attractive Than BTC? Ethereum is emerging as a more useful treasury asset than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin is often held for its scarcity, Ethereum offers the added benefits of staking rewards, currently around 3%, along with access to DeFi tools that can boost returns. In regions with strict crypto regulations, Ethereum also stands out. The report suggests that ETH can serve as a smart workaround for companies that want crypto exposure on their balance sheets but face regulatory limitations. That makes ETH a more flexible option for publicly listed firms. Staking Brings Rewards and Risks However, a Bernstein report highlights how Ethereum treasuries are taking a different approach than Bitcoin-focused ones. Instead of just holding ETH, companies are staking it to earn yield and boost earnings. But this strategy isn’t without risks. There are liquidity delays when unstaking, and tools like restaking or DeFi protocols introduce smart contract risks that traditional assets don’t face. Companies like BitMine, SharpLink, and Bit Digital have accumulated over 876,000 ETH in July, with BitMine alone crossing $2 billion in ETH and aiming for 5% the total supply.

According to DLNew , the platform, which claims to manage over $700 million in customer assets, notified some users via email on July 19 that “ Abra Earn international services are currently paused, effective immediately ” due to “ broader risk management efforts ” and “ external circumstances outside of our control. “ Silent Crisis Unfolds as CEO Continues Public Promotion Customers report being unable to withdraw funds for several weeks, with support representatives cutting them off and ignoring requests for explanations. Users have taken to social media platforms to plead directly with CEO Bill Barhydt, who continues promoting the company while avoiding customer inquiries. Source: Comments under Barhydt’s X post The crisis emerged just over a year after Abra reached settlements with 25 US states requiring $82 million in customer refunds for operating without proper licenses. The platform previously faced insolvency allegations from Texas regulators in 2023, who claimed Abra had been insolvent since March 2023. Customer reports of missed payments and withdrawal issues began appearing online in early June, with affected users describing zero yields on accounts that previously generated returns. Source: Comments under the company’s X post The situation recalls the collapse of major crypto lenders, including Celsius and BlockFi , in 2022. Speculatively, Abra appears to offer high yields through unsecured lending and DeFi activities. The platform recently launched new services targeting institutional clients and high-net-worth individuals, but it is facing mounting customer service failures. Pattern of Regulatory Violations and Financial Distress Abra’s current crisis follows years of regulatory violations and financial difficulties across multiple jurisdictions. In June 2023, the Texas State Securities Board accused the platform of securities fraud , alleging Abra misled investors while operating in a state of insolvency or near-insolvency. Texas regulators claimed Abra secretly transferred over $118 million in digital assets to Binance while concealing financial information about loan defaults and asset transfers. The board alleged Abra held $30 million in failed lender Babel Finance, $30 million in Genesis, and $10 million in collapsed Three Arrows Capital. The platform reached a $82.1 million settlement with 25 US states in June 2024 for operating without required money transmission licenses. Under the agreement, CEO Bill Barhydt was personally barred from involvement in money transmission services within those states for five years. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority warned in November 2023 that Abra was not authorized to offer services in the country and advised against dealing with the firm. Georgia’s Banking and Finance Department ordered Barhydt to be personally liable for returning funds to US customers. The SEC settled charges against Abra in August 2024 for improperly marketing Abra Earn as an unregistered security. At its peak, Abra Earn managed approximately $600 million in assets, with nearly $500 million from US investors before the program was phased out. Multiple state investigations revealed Abra offered crypto transactions through its mobile app without the necessary licenses, leading to the forced cessation of US operations and customer fund returns. International Customers Left Without Recourse as Platform Struggles The current withdrawal pause appears to affect only international customers, with unclear reasons for the geographic limitation. Alan, a customer from Guatemala, reported through DLNews being unable to access $1,200 deposited on the platform after noticing zero yields on previously interest-bearing accounts. Customer service responses have become increasingly generic, with official Abra accounts providing stock responses offering little guidance or help. Recent Trustpilot reviews describe representatives cutting off communications and ignoring fund access requests entirely. CEO Barhydt continues to appear on podcasts and post multiple times daily on social media, while customers plead for responses in the comment sections. The disconnect between promotional activities and customer service failures has intensified user frustration and concern. The platform’s claimed $700 million in managed assets represents significant customer exposure if withdrawal restrictions persist or expand.

2025-07-29 14:00:12+00:00,U.S. Stock Markets: Decoding the Day’s Crucial Mixed Signals,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Markets: Decoding the Day’s Crucial Mixed Signals In the dynamic world of global finance, the opening bell on Wall Street often sets the tone for investor sentiment across various asset classes, including the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Today, U.S. stock markets presented a mixed picture, a scenario that often prompts investors to pause and consider the underlying currents influencing their portfolios. While some indices edged higher, others experienced a slight dip, painting a complex canvas for the day’s trading. Understanding the Nuances of a Mixed Opening for U.S. Stock Markets When we talk about U.S. stock markets opening ‘mixed,’ it signifies a divergence in performance among the major indices. This isn’t just a random fluctuation; it often reflects varied investor perceptions about different sectors of the economy or specific company prospects. Let’s break down what today’s numbers reveal: S&P 500: +0.22% – As a broad measure of large-cap U.S. equities, the S&P 500’s modest gain suggests a general, albeit cautious, positive sentiment across a wide range of industries. This index is often seen as a bellwether for the overall health of the U.S. economy. NASDAQ: +0.56% – The technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite showed a more robust gain. This performance often indicates investor confidence in growth stocks, particularly those in the technology, biotechnology, and internet sectors. A strong NASDAQ can sometimes signal a ‘risk-on’ appetite, where investors are willing to embrace higher-growth, potentially higher-risk assets. Dow Jones: -0.01% – Conversely, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises 30 significant U.S. blue-chip companies, registered a slight dip. This index is often viewed as a reflection of traditional industrial and established corporate America. A minor decline here, while seemingly insignificant, can suggest a cautious approach towards value stocks or a slight rotation out of more mature industries. The table below summarizes today’s opening: Index Performance Primary Focus S&P 500 +0.22% Broad market, large-cap equities NASDAQ +0.56% Technology and growth companies Dow Jones -0.01% Industrial and blue-chip companies Why Are the U.S. Stock Markets Displaying Mixed Signals? A mixed opening is rarely arbitrary; it typically stems from a confluence of macroeconomic factors, corporate news, and investor psychology. Understanding these drivers is key to interpreting the market’s behavior: Economic Data Releases: Investors are constantly reacting to fresh economic data. This could include inflation reports, unemployment figures, manufacturing indices, or consumer confidence surveys. Positive data in one area might boost certain sectors, while weaker data elsewhere could weigh on others. For instance, strong tech earnings might lift NASDAQ, even if broader economic concerns dampen the Dow. Federal Reserve Policy Expectations: The anticipation of interest rate changes or shifts in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve can significantly impact market sentiment. Higher interest rates typically make borrowing more expensive, which can affect corporate profits and growth stock valuations more acutely than established, dividend-paying companies. Corporate Earnings Reports: Individual company earnings can create sector-specific movements. A stellar report from a major tech company could propel the NASDAQ, while a disappointing outlook from an industrial giant might pull down the Dow, even if the broader S&P 500 remains relatively stable. Geopolitical Developments: Global events, such as international conflicts, trade disputes, or political instability, can introduce uncertainty into the markets. These factors often lead to a ‘flight to safety’ in some assets while increasing volatility in others, contributing to a mixed performance. Sector Rotation: Sometimes, a mixed market indicates a ‘sector rotation,’ where investors are shifting capital from one industry or type of stock to another, based on changing economic outlooks or investment themes. For example, moving from defensive stocks to growth stocks, or vice versa. The Ripple Effect: How U.S. Stock Markets Influence Cryptocurrency For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, the performance of U.S. stock markets is far from an isolated event. There’s a growing correlation between traditional financial markets and the crypto space, particularly with bellwether assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Here’s why: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When traditional markets, especially growth-oriented indices like the NASDAQ, perform well, it often signals a ‘risk-on’ environment. In such periods, investors are generally more willing to allocate capital to higher-risk, higher-reward assets, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a ‘risk-off’ environment, often triggered by uncertainty in traditional markets, can lead to a withdrawal of capital from riskier assets, impacting crypto prices negatively.

2025-07-29 14:02:08+00:00,The Company with the Most Ethereum Has Made an Incredible ETH Price Prediction!,"The treasury strategy for Ethereum (ETH) has seen a huge boom recently, with BitMine Immersion Technologies becoming the largest institutional ETH holder. The company holds more than $2 billion worth of Ethereum. BitMine Chairman Tom Lee''s “Executive Message” video series, designed to inform investors about Ethereum''s long-term bullish potential, has released an incredible price prediction for ETH. At this point, BitMine claimed that the Ethereum price could be $60,000 based on reliable research from numerous firms. In its post, Bitmine stated that they consulted with numerous research firms to estimate Ethereum''s potential value. The firms used a “reserve value” model to assess Ethereum''s value in terms of payment systems and payment volumes, and estimated the total network value to be $7 trillion. Since Ethereum currently has a network value of only $0.4 trillion and a price around $3,800, the analysis suggests that Ethereum has the potential for an 18x increase and its price could be around $60,000. While this prediction aligns with the company''s ETH treasury strategies, it''s not considered an achievable price target in the short term, as Tom Lee predicts Ethereum could reach around $15,000 by the end of the year.

Since Ethereum currently has a network value of only $0.4 trillion and a price around $3,800, the analysis suggests that Ethereum has the potential for an 18x increase and its price could be around $60,000. While this prediction aligns with the company''s ETH treasury strategies, it''s not considered an achievable price target in the short term, as Tom Lee predicts Ethereum could reach around $15,000 by the end of the year.

2025-07-29 14:10:10+00:00,Twenty One Capital Unveils Massive Bitcoin Holdings Boost,"BitcoinWorld Twenty One Capital Unveils Massive Bitcoin Holdings Boost The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant news as Twenty One Capital, an emerging player in the digital asset space, is set to make a colossal addition to its Bitcoin holdings . This strategic move, involving a substantial transfer of 5,800 BTC from Tether, is poised to elevate Twenty One Capital’s total Bitcoin reserves to an impressive 43,500 BTC before its highly anticipated listing. This development isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful statement about institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and an event that warrants a closer look for anyone keen on understanding the evolving landscape of digital finance. What’s Driving This Significant Boost in Bitcoin Holdings ? The core of this exciting news comes from a report by @cryptounfolded on X, indicating that Twenty One Capital expects to receive an additional 5,800 BTC from Tether. This infusion will significantly bolster their existing reserves, pushing their total Bitcoin holdings to at least 43,500 BTC. To put this into perspective, such a substantial accumulation places Twenty One Capital among a growing cohort of publicly traded companies that are embracing Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. This move is particularly noteworthy as it precedes Twenty One Capital’s planned listing. Acquiring a significant amount of Bitcoin before going public can serve multiple strategic purposes: Strengthening the Balance Sheet: A robust Bitcoin reserve can be viewed as a strong asset, enhancing the company’s financial standing and appeal to potential investors. Signaling Conviction: It sends a clear message to the market about the company’s long-term belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition and its role in the future of finance. Capitalizing on Market Opportunities: Strategic accumulation before a listing might suggest a belief in future appreciation, positioning the company to benefit from Bitcoin’s growth. This isn’t merely a transaction; it’s a strategic maneuver designed to optimize the company’s position in the rapidly evolving digital asset economy. The Strategic Play: Why Twenty One Capital is Doubling Down on Bitcoin Holdings In an era where digital assets are increasingly gaining mainstream acceptance, companies like Twenty One Capital are recognizing Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate store of value and a potential hedge against traditional market volatility and inflation. Their decision to significantly increase their Bitcoin holdings reflects several key strategic considerations: 1. Embracing the Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin has cemented its reputation as ‘digital gold,’ offering a decentralized, finite supply that stands in stark contrast to fiat currencies subject to inflation. For companies seeking long-term asset preservation, Bitcoin presents an attractive alternative. 2. Attracting Crypto-Savvy Investors: In the current market, institutional investors and even retail participants are increasingly looking for companies with exposure to digital assets. A substantial Bitcoin treasury can make a company more appealing to a new generation of investors who understand and value the potential of cryptocurrencies. 3. Pioneering Future Financial Models: By holding significant Bitcoin, Twenty One Capital positions itself at the forefront of financial innovation. This could open doors to new business models, services, or partnerships built around digital assets, differentiating them from traditional firms. 4. Diversification of Treasury Assets: While traditional corporate treasuries primarily hold cash and short-term debt, a growing number of forward-thinking companies are diversifying into Bitcoin. This strategy aims to optimize returns and protect against the erosion of purchasing power, particularly in times of economic uncertainty. This calculated expansion of their Bitcoin holdings underscores a broader trend of institutional adoption, where companies are not just dipping their toes but diving headfirst into the digital asset ocean. Tether’s Role: A Deeper Look into the Bitcoin Holdings Transfer The involvement of Tether in this transaction adds another layer of intrigue. Tether, primarily known as the issuer of USDT, the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, also holds significant reserves in various assets, including Bitcoin. The report indicates that Twenty One Capital will ‘receive’ 5,800 BTC ‘from’ Tether, suggesting Tether is the direct counterparty in this transfer. This could imply a few scenarios: Strategic Divestment from Tether’s Reserves: Tether holds substantial Bitcoin as part of its non-stablecoin reserves. This transfer could be a strategic move to rebalance their portfolio or facilitate a transaction with a key partner like Twenty One Capital. Facilitation of an OTC Deal: Tether’s extensive network and liquidity in the crypto space mean it could be facilitating an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, where a large block of ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/twenty-one-capital-bitcoin-holdings/,BTC|USDT|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Crypto Investment|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Tether|Twenty One Capital,BTC,"Twenty One Capital Unveils Massive Bitcoin Holdings Boost.

2025-07-29 14:11:22+00:00,Strong Momentum On Bitcoin? Then I Choose FBTC,"Summary FBTC is among the most liquid and tightest bid/ask spread spot ETFs on BTC, but not the cheapest. This makes it suitable for faster trading contexts and sets it apart from solutions like BTC or HODL. I remain bullish because Bitcoin is showing increasing alignment with risk-on assets (like the Nasdaq), and less with safe haven assets like gold. Trump’s victories in the trade arena could create fertile ground for risk-on assets, and potentially for Bitcoin as well. An altseason also seems to be emerging, driven by the institutionalization of crypto, which could bring increased volatility. The Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ETF ( FBTC ) is not the most cost-effective, but it is definitely the most talked about/appreciated. And this is something I’ve especially noticed among traders and short-term operators. There’s a tendency to prefer FBTC over possibly cheaper solutions. In fact, among the spot Bitcoin funds, it has one of the highest AUMs, and in my peer table, it ranks second only to IBIT. FBTC - IBIT: Profile (Seeking Alpha) It caught my attention, and from the ETF analysis, an interesting and indeed distinctive factor emerged: a reduced bid-ask spread and a minimal premium discount (1m rolling avg). But the question naturally arises: if the horizon shifts to the very short/short/medium term, what is the right approach to FBTC? Personally, I still tend to have a bullish view, as a consequence of my strictly momentum-oriented approach when working in the short term (those who follow me know that in the long term I tend to favor the quality aspect instead). The reason? The triumph of risk-on, thanks to the achievements reached by President Donald Trump in the trade arena. But also the positive evolution of the institutional narrative, with the GENIUS Act , which seems to align Bitcoin’s price action more and more with the Nasdaq-100, rather than with gold and the concept of a safe haven asset. But before that … What is FBTC? FBTC is the Spot ETF proposed by Fidelity Investments on Bitcoin, 100% backed by physical bitcoin (no derivatives, no leverage), with Fidelity Digital Asset Services (FDAS) as the custodian and custody mainly in cold storage with dynamic allocation (target >98%). And let’s be honest, it’s not the first, nor the last solution launched by investment firms to take part in the “Bitcoin rush.” What we can ask ourselves is: is it the best? Well, it has an expense ratio of 0.25%; so it’s definitely not the cheapest. Fees are paid in bitcoin: the number of BTC per share decreases over time. However, it has a 30-day average bid/ask spread of +0.01% and Premium/Discount (1m rolling avg): +0.01%. FBTC - Expense Grade (Seeking Alpha) Not surprisingly, I notice it’s the preferred instrument among my colleagues for spot operations, or even daily or swing trading. This is because it’s fairly representative of BTC’s price in the short term, considering that the calculation method is the Volume-Weighted Median Price (VWMP) every 15 seconds , over rolling 60-minute windows. Peer: It has an AUM (Assets Under Management) of $23.99 billion, so we definitely can’t say it’s not appreciated in the market: not by chance, only 30% of the ownership distribution is institutional; almost 70% is public retail, probably attracted by the Fidelity brand and its interoperability. Even though there are alternatives in the market, some would call them “better”: first of all, HODL and BTC have lower costs. And IBIT has higher AUM and volumes. FBTC - IBIT - BTC - HODL: Profile (Seeking Alpha) The result? Practically, short-term performance is very similar. The difference in expense ratio could generate a divergence in the long run, which leads me to prefer BTC or HODL for long-term portfolio solutions. But considering liquidity parameters, like the bid/ask spread and the relationship with NAV, FBTC remains a hot pick in my opinion (as, to some extent, does IBIT). And I must admit that among the prop trading community, it’s very much appreciated in this sense. FBTC - IBIT - HODL - BTC : Liquidity and expense grade (Seeking Alpha) Outlook for FBTC When it comes to the short term, I like to think like a CTA: with trend-following strategies. And in the short term, I embrace momentum as a winning strategy. And today, BTC-USD has a strongly positive momentum. The same quant rating is STRONG BUY, and here we know that trading such tickers statistically generates alpha. FBTC - Quant rating (Seeking Alpha) What drives FBTC’s positive momentum? Simply, markets are in risk-on mode . The tariff agreements Trump is making with global partners are theoretically a positive element for risk-on assets, and we can see this from the rising price of the Nasdaq index. Since Bitcoin is now widely considered by the market as a risk-on asset, BTC demand is rising too. And I don’t see it as something strange or senseless: personally, I also distance myself from the Bitcoin = Safe haven asset parallel.

2025-07-29 14:24:20+00:00,Bakkt offloads loyalty business to build $11M crypto treasury armory,"On Monday, crypto custody and trading firm Bakkt Holdings Inc. revealed it’s divesting its loyalty services arm to concentrate on core crypto infrastructure operations. The firm agreed to sell its loyalty business for $11 million to Project Labrador Holdco, LLC, an affiliate of Roman DBDR Technology Advisors, Inc. The deal is slated to close in Q3 of this year. Bakkt Holdings wants to focus on core infrastructure solutions Bakkt Holdings Inc. and Roman DBDR Technology Advisors have agreed on $11 million in cash, subject to working capital and debt adjustments, plus a short-term restricted cash loan to support the transition. Andy Main, Bakkt’s president and co-CEO, commented on the deal, saying , “With the pending sale of our Loyalty business, we’re taking a clear step toward becoming a leaner, crypto-first company.” The company also insisted that its new arrangement will allow it to dedicate resources to core crypto offerings and the stablecoin payments infrastructure. Earlier this year, the firm had hinted at plans to sell its loyalty division after it confirmed the non-renewals from two major clients—Bank of America for loyalty services and Webull for crypto services. The two institutions’ decision, however, consequently triggered a sharp selloff, causing Bakkt’s shares to drop over 27% in just one day. Investors even criticized the firm for failing to disclose the fragility of its revenue model. Some filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming it did not reveal the full extent of its financial dependence on the two major clients. The suit names several top Bakkt executives, including former CEO Gavin Michael, current CEO Andrew Main, and interim CFO Karen Alexander. Bank of America accounted for roughly 16% of Bakkt’s loyalty service revenue in 2023, and Webull, 74% of Bakkt’s crypto service revenue in 2024. Meanwhile, in June, Bakkt sought to raise up to $1 billion through various securities offerings, with some funds set for Bitcoin (BTC) purchases. Moreover, in its latest update, the firm projected Q2 crypto revenues between $568 million and $569 million and outlined plans for a capital raise via a public offering of Class A shares and/or pre-funded warrants. The company hopes to raise about $75 million to support digital asset acquisitions, working capital, and operational costs. The offering is expected to close on Wednesday. Akshay Naheta, who became co-CEO in March, also said the company intends to implement agentic AI solutions to enhance its crypto and stablecoin products and will aggressively execute its treasury strategy. Bakkt has been grappling with financial issues since 2021 In 2024, there was speculation that Trump Media & Technology Group wanted to acquire the company, which ultimately drove the company’s stock rally of over 160% . However, the two companies never confirmed the deal. However, the company has openly been struggling with liquidity problems, and its stock has dwindled since 2021, despite realigning its business toward crypto custody and trading services. A February disclosure showed it lacked sufficient capital to sustain operations for the next 12 months. Furthermore, on Monday, Bakkt Holdings (BKKT) shares closed nearly 5% lower and dropped an additional 27.8% in after-hours trading to $12.40, deepening its year-to-date loss to nearly 31%.

2025-07-29 14:30:11+00:00,Antelope Enterprise’s Bold Bitcoin Investment: A Game-Changing $50M Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Antelope Enterprise’s Bold Bitcoin Investment: A Game-Changing $50M Strategy The world of corporate finance just got a jolt! In a move that’s sending ripples across the digital asset landscape, Antelope Enterprise Holdings, an established energy supply business, has announced a monumental financial agreement. This isn’t just any deal; it’s a strategic pivot towards the future of finance, with a clear focus on a significant Bitcoin investment . This bold step highlights a growing trend of traditional companies embracing cryptocurrencies, signaling a potential shift in how corporate treasuries manage their assets. Antelope Enterprise’s Visionary Bitcoin Investment: A Strategic Leap? Antelope Enterprise Holdings, primarily known for its operations in the energy sector, has recently inked a transformative deal with Streeterville Capital. This agreement secures up to $50 million in financing, earmarked specifically for the acquisition of Bitcoin (BTC). The funds will be drawn in tranches over a 24-month period, allowing Antelope Enterprise to strategically purchase BTC as market conditions dictate. This flexible approach underscores a careful consideration of market volatility and a commitment to optimizing their Bitcoin investment strategy. This isn’t just about adding a new asset to the balance sheet; it’s about making a statement. For an energy supply business to commit such substantial capital to a digital asset like Bitcoin speaks volumes about the perceived long-term value and stability of cryptocurrency. It positions Antelope Enterprise not just as an energy provider, but as a forward-thinking entity embracing the digital revolution. Unpacking the $50 Million Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy The details of the financing agreement reveal a methodical approach to this substantial Bitcoin investment . Here’s a closer look at the key aspects: Total Financing: Up to $50 million. Funding Source: Streeterville Capital. Disbursement: Drawn in tranches over a 24-month period. This allows for dollar-cost averaging, mitigating the risk of large single-point purchases in a volatile market. Exclusive Use: Funds are solely for Bitcoin acquisition. This specificity removes ambiguity and reinforces the strategic intent behind the move. Market-Dependent Purchases: Acquisitions will occur “as market conditions allow,” indicating a flexible and opportunistic strategy rather than a rigid schedule. This adaptability is crucial in the dynamic crypto market. This structured approach suggests a well-thought-out plan rather than a speculative gamble. It allows Antelope Enterprise to capitalize on potential dips in Bitcoin’s price while spreading their risk over an extended period. This kind of calculated entry is often lauded as a prudent strategy for long-term digital asset accumulation. Why is Antelope Enterprise Betting Big on Bitcoin? The decision by a traditional energy company to make such a significant Bitcoin investment isn’t arbitrary. Several compelling factors likely influenced Antelope Enterprise’s strategic shift: Inflation Hedge: With global economic uncertainties and rising inflation, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a store of value, akin to digital gold. Its finite supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently deflationary, protecting purchasing power over time. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Traditional corporate treasuries often hold cash and low-yield bonds. Adding Bitcoin offers a new avenue for diversification, potentially enhancing overall portfolio returns and reducing correlation with traditional markets. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown remarkable growth over the long term. Companies like MicroStrategy have demonstrated the potential for substantial returns from holding BTC. Antelope Enterprise could be aiming to replicate this success. Embracing Innovation: Aligning with cutting-edge technologies and digital trends can enhance a company’s image and attract new talent and investors. It signals a forward-thinking leadership willing to adapt to the evolving financial landscape. Strategic Alignment: While an energy company, there’s a growing nexus between energy, sustainable practices, and Bitcoin mining. This investment could be a precursor to broader involvement in the digital asset ecosystem. This move reflects a growing confidence among corporations in Bitcoin’s long-term viability and its role in the future of finance. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s maturing narrative beyond just a speculative asset. Potential Impacts of Corporate Bitcoin Investment on the Market When a company like Antelope Enterprise announces a $50 million Bitcoin investment , it sends ripples through the crypto market and beyond. What could be the potential consequences? Increased Institutional Adoption: Every new corporate treasury adding Bitcoin strengthens the narrative of institutional adoption.

The cryptocurrency market is once again sending ripples through the financial world as Bitcoin (BTC) experiences a significant Bitcoin price drop , falling below the crucial $118,000 mark. According to real-time market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at approximately $117,994.22 on major exchanges like Binance USDT market. This sudden downturn has left many investors questioning the immediate future of the digital asset and what strategies they should consider. This comprehensive guide aims to unpack the reasons behind this latest market movement, offer historical context, and provide actionable insights for navigating these volatile times. Whether you are a seasoned trader or a new entrant to the crypto space, understanding the dynamics of a Bitcoin price drop is essential for making informed decisions. Unpacking the Reasons Behind the Bitcoin Price Drop When a digital asset as prominent as Bitcoin experiences a sharp decline, it’s rarely due to a single factor. The current Bitcoin price drop is likely the confluence of several interconnected elements, ranging from macroeconomic pressures to specific market behaviors. Understanding these underlying causes is crucial for investors looking to make sense of the volatility. Macroeconomic Headwinds: A Global Impact on Bitcoin Price The broader global economic landscape often casts a long shadow over the cryptocurrency market. Factors such as persistent inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions can significantly influence investor sentiment and capital allocation. When traditional markets show signs of instability, investors often de-risk, pulling funds from more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. This ‘flight to safety’ can exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price , as investors seek refuge in less volatile assets like government bonds or the US dollar. The anticipation of further interest rate hikes by central banks, for instance, can make riskier assets less attractive, contributing to sell-offs. Regulatory Uncertainty: Shaping the Future of BTC Price The evolving regulatory environment also plays a pivotal role in the cryptocurrency market. Announcements or rumors of new regulations, stricter enforcement, or outright bans in certain jurisdictions can trigger widespread panic and lead to a rapid Bitcoin price drop . Governments worldwide are grappling with how to classify and oversee digital assets, and their decisions can have profound effects on market liquidity and investor confidence. Ambiguity surrounding these policies can deter institutional investors and create an atmosphere of caution among retail traders, leading to selling pressure. Whale Activity and Market Dynamics: Influencing the Bitcoin Price Trajectory The cryptocurrency market is heavily influenced by ‘whales’ – large holders of Bitcoin who can move significant amounts of capital. A large sell-off by a whale or a group of whales can instantly flood the market with supply, causing the Bitcoin price to plummet. These large transactions can trigger automated stop-loss orders from smaller traders, creating a cascade effect that exacerbates the downward trend. Furthermore, the overall market sentiment, driven by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) or exuberance (FOMO), can amplify these movements, leading to rapid price swings. Technical Indicators and Support Levels: What the Charts Say About the Bitcoin Price For many traders, technical analysis provides crucial insights into potential price movements. The $118,000 level may have been identified as a significant support level by technical analysts. When such a critical support level is breached, it often signals further downside potential, triggering more sell orders as traders adjust their positions. This self-fulfilling prophecy can accelerate a Bitcoin price drop , as algorithms and human traders react to the broken thresholds. Key indicators like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and trading volumes are closely watched for signs of a reversal or continuation of a trend. What Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Mean for Your Portfolio? A sudden decline in the Bitcoin price can be unsettling, especially for those new to the market’s inherent volatility. However, understanding its implications is key to reacting rationally rather than emotionally. Navigating Volatility: The Inevitable Side of Bitcoin Price Swings Volatility is a hallmark of the cryptocurrency market, and a Bitcoin price drop is not an anomaly but rather a recurring feature. While it can lead to temporary paper losses, it also tests investors’ conviction and long-term strategy. Panic selling often locks in losses and prevents participation in subsequent recoveries.

2025-07-29 14:35:29+00:00,D2X raises $5 million as EU race for compliant crypto derivatives heats up,"Amsterdam-based crypto exchange D2X has raised €4.3 million ($5 million) in fresh capital as demand accelerates for regulated crypto derivatives across Europe. The round, led by CMT Digital, Circle Ventures, and Canton Ventures, reinforces D2X’s strategy to provide a MiFID II-compliant venue for institutional clients seeking exposure to Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives. The funding was first reported by Silicon Canals . The investment follows last year’s €9.1 million Series A and comes at a time when traditional financial players are increasingly exploring digital asset markets. With a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF) licence granted by the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets (AFM), D2X is among the first in the EU to offer a legally recognised path for institutional crypto derivatives trading. Capital support expands beyond new backers The latest fundraising round saw follow-on participation from prominent names including Point72 Ventures, Tioga Capital, GSR, and Fortino Capital. These investors had backed the firm’s 2023 Series A round, which was key to D2X becoming the first crypto exchange in the European Union to secure a MiFID-compliant MTF licence. The fresh €4.3 million will help D2X build out its product suite and speed up the onboarding process for Tier-1 institutions. Its platform currently supports USD- and EUR-denominated Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Options contracts are also expected to launch soon. Institutional demand for regulatory clarity and seven-day trading infrastructure has been growing. D2X’s architecture is tailored to accommodate the 24/7 nature of crypto markets while remaining in line with European financial compliance norms. Focus on dollar-settled crypto futures A major addition to D2X’s offering is its recent launch of USD-based futures for BTC and ETH. These contracts cater specifically to institutions requiring dollar-settled instruments and seek exposure through regulated channels. With real-time USD exposure, MiFID II oversight, and a weekend-ready setup, D2X is positioning itself as a key player in Europe’s evolving crypto derivatives market. The exchange’s ability to serve institutional clients without routing them to offshore venues marks a distinct competitive edge. The firm was founded by Theodore Rozencwajg, Don van der Krogt, and Laetitia Grimaud. Its primary focus remains building infrastructure to support compliant access to digital asset derivatives in Europe. Coinbase ramps up US offering for retail traders The European expansion by D2X parallels a broader regulatory shift happening in the United States. Coinbase, the largest US-based exchange, launched CFTC-regulated nano Bitcoin and Ethereum perpetual futures last week. These products allow retail traders to access up to 10x leverage in a fully regulated environment. Offered through Coinbase Financial Markets, the contracts are settled in USD and mirror the characteristics of traditional perpetual futures, including five-year expirations and hourly funding rates. The offering is available 24/7 and charges low taker fees starting at 0.02%. Historically, retail traders in the US have been pushed to unregulated offshore platforms for derivatives trading. Coinbase’s latest move aligns with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) standards, creating a compliant alternative to riskier venues. Institutions seek safety and structure in digital markets Both D2X and Coinbase are responding to an uptick in institutional and retail interest for safe, regulated crypto derivatives. With MiFID II regulation in Europe and CFTC compliance in the US, the trend points towards a more structured future for digital asset trading. The race to capture this demand is unfolding on both sides of the Atlantic. While D2X focuses on institutional clients in Europe, Coinbase is targeting retail investors in the US, each leveraging regulatory clarity to build long-term trading infrastructure.

The offering is available 24/7 and charges low taker fees starting at 0.02%. Historically, retail traders in the US have been pushed to unregulated offshore platforms for derivatives trading. Coinbase’s latest move aligns with Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) standards, creating a compliant alternative to riskier venues. Institutions seek safety and structure in digital markets Both D2X and Coinbase are responding to an uptick in institutional and retail interest for safe, regulated crypto derivatives. With MiFID II regulation in Europe and CFTC compliance in the US, the trend points towards a more structured future for digital asset trading. The race to capture this demand is unfolding on both sides of the Atlantic. While D2X focuses on institutional clients in Europe, Coinbase is targeting retail investors in the US, each leveraging regulatory clarity to build long-term trading infrastructure.

Should We Expect a Rise or a Fall?,"Ethereum (ETH) has made a big breakout in recent weeks and is taking firm steps towards its new ATH. At this point, Ethereum has fallen to the $3,800 level after hitting a seven-month high of $3,940. It is now expected to surpass the key $4,000 resistance level. While the market is generally expecting higher levels, maintaining Ethereum’s upward momentum, a new analysis has come from Standard Chartered. According to Coindesk, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick stated that Ethereum (ETH) will continue its rise thanks to the increase in institutional demand. Stating that institutional investors are turning from Bitcoin to Ethereum due to regulatory restrictions, the analyst stated that if institutional ETH purchases continue, it could surpass the key resistance level of $4,000, which is their current estimate for the end of 2025. The bank also noted in the report that institutional treasuries have purchased 1% of all Ethereum in circulation since the beginning of June. He added that Standard Chartered estimates ETH treasury holdings could reach 10% of the supply due to staking returns and DeFi access. “Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum treasuries offer yields from staking rewards, currently around 3%, and decentralized finance (DeFi) leverage opportunities, giving them a structural advantage over BTC treasuries. This regulatory arbitrage makes Ethereum an increasingly attractive asset for publicly traded companies looking to hold digital assets on their balance sheets, especially in jurisdictions where direct crypto access is limited.” *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29 15:00:11+00:00,Bitcoin: Unveiling Its Crucial Role as a Hedge Against the U.S. Deficit,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Unveiling Its Crucial Role as a Hedge Against the U.S. Deficit In a surprising turn that has captivated the financial world, CNBC’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer, a figure often associated with skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, has publicly declared that ‘Bitcoin is a hedge against the U.S. budget deficit.’ This bold statement marks a significant shift in perception from a mainstream financial commentator, highlighting a growing acknowledgment of Bitcoin’s potential role in global economics. For anyone keenly observing the evolving landscape of digital assets, this endorsement suggests a deeper narrative unfolding around the utility of a Bitcoin hedge in an increasingly uncertain economic climate. Why is Jim Cramer Calling Bitcoin a ‘Bitcoin Hedge’? Jim Cramer’s recent comments, as reported by U.Today, signal a notable evolution in his stance on Bitcoin. Historically, Cramer has been known for his cautious, sometimes even critical, views on cryptocurrencies. His latest pronouncement, however, positions Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset but as a strategic financial instrument. But what exactly prompted this change of heart, and why does he see Bitcoin as a viable Bitcoin hedge against something as fundamental as the U.S. budget deficit? Economic Hardship and Political Instability: Cramer posits that Bitcoin could offer a shield for nations and individuals against the adverse effects of economic hardship and political instability. A ballooning national debt can lead to inflation, currency devaluation, and a loss of confidence in traditional financial systems. In such scenarios, an asset that operates outside government control and traditional banking infrastructure gains appeal. Decentralization and Scarcity: Unlike fiat currencies, which can be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks, Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins. This inherent scarcity, combined with its decentralized nature, makes it resistant to inflationary pressures and political manipulation, characteristics that are highly desirable in a hedging asset. A Personal Anecdote: Cramer reinforced his argument by recalling the story of an anonymous worker who, five years ago, purchased Bitcoin when it was trading under $50,000. This individual now enjoys financial freedom, a testament to Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation. Such stories, while anecdotal, resonate deeply and illustrate the transformative potential of early adoption, underscoring the power of a strategic Bitcoin hedge . Understanding the U.S. Budget Deficit: A Backdrop for the Bitcoin Hedge Argument To fully grasp the significance of Cramer’s statement, it’s crucial to understand the context of the U.S. budget deficit. The budget deficit occurs when government expenditures exceed its revenues, leading to an accumulation of national debt. Persistent and large deficits can have several profound economic implications: Inflationary Pressures: Governments often finance deficits by borrowing or, in some cases, by increasing the money supply. The latter can lead to inflation, eroding the purchasing power of a currency and devaluing savings. Currency Devaluation: A country with a large and growing debt may see its currency weaken against others, making imports more expensive and potentially reducing the nation’s economic standing on the global stage. Economic Instability: High levels of debt can lead to higher interest rates, reduced government spending flexibility, and increased risk of economic crises, potentially impacting everything from employment to investment. In this environment, investors and nations seek assets that can preserve value and offer stability. Gold has traditionally served this role, but Cramer’s argument suggests Bitcoin is emerging as a digital alternative, providing a modern form of a Bitcoin hedge . Beyond the National Level: Bitcoin as a Personal ‘Bitcoin Hedge’ While Cramer’s focus was on nations, the concept of Bitcoin as a hedge extends powerfully to individuals. For many, the idea of a Bitcoin hedge against personal financial hardship or the erosion of savings due to inflation is highly compelling. Consider the following ways Bitcoin can act as a personal safeguard: Feature of Bitcoin How it Acts as a Hedge Scarcity (21 Million Cap) Protects against inflation and debasement of value, unlike fiat currencies that can be printed infinitely. Decentralization Operates outside government or central bank control, reducing political risk and censorship. Global Accessibility Can be accessed and transferred anywhere in the world, offering financial sovereignty, especially in regions with unstable local currencies. Divisibility Can be divided into tiny units (satoshi), making it accessible for investments of all sizes. The anonymous worker’s story is a vivid example of this personal hedge in action.

Coinbase Integrates Samsung PayThis update lets users fund their accounts directly through the Coinbase app using Samsung Pay, without needing to switch apps or re-enter payment information. The feature has already started reaching some users across North America, with full availability expected in the coming weeks, according to a press release today.With this partnership with Samsung, Coinbase combines its secure platform with the convenience of one of the world''s leading mobile wallets. Specifically, users with Samsung Pay can now move from browsing to buying crypto in just a few taps. https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1950201337720836360The goal is to make the process feel as natural as sending a message or tapping to pay at checkout, especially as the crypto scene continues to attract new entrants.Growing Global Crypto Adoption Demands Easier OnboardingNotably, the latest trends in 2025 show just how fast crypto adoption is growing. Per recent reports , around 28% of American adults, roughly 65 million people, now own some form of digital asset, nearly double the number from 2021. Meanwhile, among those who haven''t yet entered the space, 14% plan to buy this year, while 67% of current owners want to grow their holdings. Interestingly, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin lead the list of coins drawing the most interest.Globally, more than 824 million people now hold digital assets, with Bitcoin in the lead and owned by about 5% of the world''s population. Reports point to a strong price growth, more institutional involvement, and easier ways to invest as the drivers of this surge. Also, consumer sentiment keeps trending positive. About 60% of Americans familiar with crypto believe prices will rise, with many pointing to political developments as a key influence.This growing momentum shows why Coinbase continues to improve its user experience.

2025-07-29 15:02:56+00:00,A 2035 Vision: Will Bitcoin Hit the Million-Dollar Milestone?,"As Bitcoin begins its third decade of existence, investors and enthusiasts around the globe are struggling with one breathtaking question: How much will one Bitcoin be worth in 2035? Ten years from now, as cryptocurrencies are deeply woven into the texture of finance and technology, long-term targets for the world''s biggest virtual asset are both ambitious and hotly debated. Consensus 2025: Million-Dollar Bitcoin Enters Mainstream Predictions being taken with grains of salt and all, one thing is sure: most forecasts up until 2025 are in agreement that the value of Bitcoin as of 2035 might be historical, even a record-breaker. Numerous comprehensive surveys point to $1 million per Bitcoin as a default scenario for 2035, with some projections even surpassing that. A July 2025 report by Finder that polled 24 cryptocurrency researchers and analysts estimates the average price of Bitcoin at the end of 2035 to be $1.02 million. It is not an outlier: many other models and reports—ranging from mainstream financial news outlets to technical and adoption-based analysis—agree on this seven-figure number, and some estimate prices even higher for the same timeline, to $1.3–1.8 million or even more. What''s Behind the Mega-Bullish Estimates? Institutional and Governmental Adoption Among the biggest tailwinds behind Bitcoin''s price potential is growing institutional and even national adoption. Over the last five years, giant corporations, hedge funds, and even nation-states have come to accumulate Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Panelists in long-range forecasts cite this ever-broadening base of ”strong hands” – entities that buy for the long haul – repeatedly as one of the most potent forces pushing the price higher. ”As governments continue to print fiat money at unsustainably high levels, people will look for alternative ways of storing value. Gold has been a store of value for centuries and bitcoin is a better version of gold,” one industry expert said. Bitcoin as ”Digital Gold” Most analysts think Bitcoin will ultimately outrank or at least match gold''s aggregate market capitalization—a situation that alone would justify a $1 million plus valuation per coin. This ”digital gold” narrative is held commonly now by investors from Wall Street to sovereign wealth funds, so fresh capital may increase consistently over the next ten years, particularly if macroeconomic uncertainty or inflationary pressures continue. Scarcity and Halving Cycles Bitcoin''s inherent monetary quality—its fixed supply of 21 million coins—never changes, and periodic ”halving” diminishes new supply over time. By 2035, the number of new-issue bitcoins minted each year will have declined considerably, further enhancing scarcity and price pressure. Technological Maturity and Utility The Bitcoin network will be more powerful, with superior transaction layers, increased processing power, and widespread adoption across financial products. Mainstream adoption may be less volatile and more due to actual economic usage if there is more secure and efficient infrastructure. Dissent and Conservative Models There has been a broadly bullish view, but some experts propose more conservative estimates by pointing out the maturing but still volatile state of crypto markets. For instance, Kraken''s model of projection—running on a steady 5% annual rate of growth—places Bitcoin in 2035 at around $194,000, a life-altering leap but still far from the million-dollar club. These more pessimistic models rather point to risk factors such as regulatory crackdowns, innovations that could supplant Bitcoin''s popularity, or a root change in investor sentiment if newer crypto assets become dominant. What Could Go Wrong? Risks and Uncertainties Macroeconomic shocks, likely legislation on cryptocurrencies, or widespread adoption of alternative technologies might all disturb these estimates. Some doomsayers, though minority in number, foresee Bitcoin moving ”a speculative bubble” or mention market manipulation and sustainability concerns as possible threats to its price trajectory. Down the line, the crypto evangelists'' prevailing refrain is one of hope: Bitcoin in 2035 will be far more mainstream, liquid, and internationally networked than ever before. Its ability to store and move value independent of government-dominated money might make it a linchpin component of ”digital nation” infrastructure. If these best-case scenarios come to pass, owning even a small percentage of a Bitcoin in 2035 could be an investment triumph like owning headline tech shares early in the internet era. In summary : The consensus 2035 price prediction for Bitcoin is at or higher than $1 million per coin, driven by institutional adoption, macro drivers, digital scarcity, and maturing market infrastructure as the primary drivers of growth. There are qualifiers and skeptics, but the next decade will likely be the most consequential chapter yet in the remarkable story of Bitcoin.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10244/bitcoin-price-prediction-2035-will-btc-hit-1-million,BTC|TRADING|FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS,News|Bitcoin,BTC,"A 2035 Vision: Will Bitcoin Hit the Million-Dollar Milestone?.

In summary : The consensus 2035 price prediction for Bitcoin is at or higher than $1 million per coin, driven by institutional adoption, macro drivers, digital scarcity, and maturing market infrastructure as the primary drivers of growth. There are qualifiers and skeptics, but the next decade will likely be the most consequential chapter yet in the remarkable story of Bitcoin."
2025-07-29 15:05:07+00:00,VC CEO Backs XRP as Global Reserve Bridge – Bitcoin Hyper Could Soar Next,"Oliver Michel, CEO of Tokentus Investment—one of Germany’s leading venture capital firms—believes $XRP could dethrone the U.S. dollar as the ultimate global reserve bridge. In his view, XRP isn’t just another altcoin; it’s the strongest candidate to link global currencies and power seamless cross-border transactions at massive scale. The idea of a crypto asset replacing the world’s dominant fiat currency is nothing short of game-changing. If this vision comes to life, it could ignite a wave of retail and institutional adoption, fueling unprecedented growth across the entire Web3 ecosystem. This bold prediction also underscores a bigger truth: the world needs crypto projects that can disrupt entrenched financial systems. Enter Bitcoin Hyper , a next-gen Layer 2 network that’s pushing the boundaries of what’s possible on Bitcoin—and shaping the future of decentralized finance. Hyperscale Data to Scoop Up $10M $XRP Michel’s bold statement hasn’t come from thin air; real-world moves are already casting a light on $XRP’s potential. At the centre of the coin’s success is Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system. It leverages $XRP as a bridge currency to facilitate instant, cost-friendly border payments without the need for pre-funded accounts in international countries. So it’s no wonder major firms are taking notice of the asset. Just this week, shares of Hyperscale Data (GPUS) jumped by over 12% after it announced plans to scoop up $10M $XRP as part of its digital asset strategy. Like Michel, Hyper Scale views $XRP as a ‘ foundational asset in the evolving global financial ecosystem .’ The company also plans to publish weekly updates on its $XRP holdings starting August 12. It is also considering a 36-month lockup for its reserves, which is a decisive vote of long-term confidence in the asset. To top it off, Coinglass data shows $2B+ in $XRP futures open interest on Bitget and nearly $4B in trade volume on Binance—both of which are clear signals of confidence and soaring market activity around $XRP. Such positive news comes despite the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently temporarily halting the launch of a multi-asset ETF that included $XRP. Still, hope isn’t fading. According to Polymarket data, analysts predict an 86% chance that a Ripple ETF will be approved this year. The buzz around $XRP reveals a bigger reality: crypto is evolving at lightning speed, and the ultimate winners won’t just ride hype, they’ll solve real-world financial roadblocks. While $XRP attracts attention over transforming cross-border payments, $HYPER is gearing up to reshape Bitcoin’s foundation through Bitcoin Hyper . Bitcoin Hyper to Boost Bitcoin With Solana’s Speed Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) goes beyond being just another Bitcoin Layer 2; it’s the infrastructure needed to revamp Bitcoin as blockchain interest rockets. Set to launch in Q3 2025, it aims to shatter Bitcoin’s biggest limitations—eliminating slow transactions, slashing fees, and finally unlocking smart contract capabilities. To achieve this, it’ll integrate the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) . By doing so, it can match the Solana network’s speed and cost-efficiency. The Layer 2 upgrade will also unlock powerful features, including high-performance dApps, real-world asset tokenization, and even launches of the best meme coins . At the core of the ecosystem is a Canonical Bridge . It’ll allow $BTC to move easily between Bitcoin 1 and Layer 2. This way, you can benefit from Bitcoin’s security while enjoying the speed and flexibility of modern smart contracts. To truly maximize Bitcoin Hyper’s potential, you’ll need $HYPER, its native token. Holding it unlocks governance power, ultra-low gas fees, and hefty staking rewards—currently boasting an impressive 181% APY. Since launching in May 2025, $HYPER has already snagged over $5M on presale. Investors have long-term confidence in the project, as evidenced by three whale buyers funneling $74.9K , $54.1K , and $10K into the project early on. Cryptos Solving Real Financial Problems Attract Attention The buzz around $XRP potentially replacing the U.S. dollar as the world’s first reserve currency proves that crypto has moved beyond pure hype—it’s now about fixing real financial inefficiencies. While $XRP eyes a dominant role in global finance, Bitcoin Hyper is preparing to breathe new life into Bitcoin itself, introducing next-level programmability and utility. With interest building and strong early backing, Bitcoin Hyper could be the next crypto to explode . You can grab $HYPER on presale for as little as $0.01245. Given the Layer 2’s launch is expected to propel it to $0.32 , now could be the perfect time to do precisely that for possible ~2,470% returns. This isn’t investment advice.

2025-07-29 15:06:32+00:00,"Expect extended Bitcoin dominance bearishness, warns expert","Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance appears poised for further decline, with multiple technical signals aligning to support a bearish continuation. According to pseudonymous crypto analyst Master Ananda, Bitcoin’s recent breakdown from a long-term uptrend, accompanied by the highest weekly volume since February 2021, suggests a potential altcoin resurgence reminiscent of the early stages of the last major bull run, he said in a TradingView post on July 23. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView The Bitcoin Dominance Index currently sits at 61.42%, following a sharp rejection at the 64.35% level, which has emerged as strong resistance on the weekly chart. The failed breakout attempt left behind a notable bearish engulfing candle, indicating weakening momentum in BTC’s relative strength versus the broader crypto market. Bitcoin dominance now hovers just above key Fibonacci levels at 61.65% and 60.30%. Failure to reclaim former support, now acting as resistance, reinforces the bearish outlook. Therefore, a decisive drop below 58.94% could open the door for further declines toward 57.01%, and potentially 47.44%, creating room for altcoins to gain traction. Ananda drew comparisons to February 2021, when a high-volume breakdown in Bitcoin dominance preceded a widespread altcoin rally. Bitcoin dominance short-term play Current technicals suggest a similar setup, with Bitcoin likely to enter a consolidation phase as altcoins gather strength. While short-term pullbacks may occur, they are viewed as opportunities to reposition, with firm resistance and tightening timeframes pointing to an imminent decline in BTC dominance. Similar sentiments were echoed on July 28 by cryptocurrency trading expert Michaël van de Poppe. He noted that the Bitcoin dominance chart is flashing clear signs of sustained downside pressure, with a powerful bearish divergence continuing to weigh on the trend. Poppe’s analysis indicated that Bitcoin’s technical indicators suggest its outperformance over altcoins may be waning, at least in the near term. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Notably, previous bearish divergences in Bitcoin dominance have consistently signaled short-term reversals, often triggering altcoin rallies. The latest divergence, which began forming in early June, has now been confirmed with a breakdown below the 52.50% level, pointing to further downside. While minor rebounds remain possible, the overall structure and declining RSI suggest momentum is shifting in favor of altcoins. As of press time, Bitcoin remained in consolidation just below the $120,000 mark, trading at $118,277, up 0.16% in the past 24 hours but down 0.76% on the weekly timeframe.

And institutional investors continue to accumulate Bitcoin, with Metaplanet increasing their Bitcoin holdings to 17,132 Bitcoins. Meanwhile, millions of crypto investors speak about earning incredible returns through Cryptosolo, a top cloud mining platform . “ Traditionally, miners needed to own a mining machine and be computational experts to earn from Bitcoin mining.

2025-07-29 15:19:08+00:00,Bold Words from the Famous Founder! This Altcoin Has Been a Better Investment Than Bitcoin Since Its Inception!,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, known for his assertive words, made new statements about Bitcoin (BTC) and ADA. In a recent interview with Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz, the Cardano founder claimed that ADA has been better than Bitcoin as an investment vehicle since its early days, surpassing it. Hoskinson referred to the 108,000 BTC he held after selling off Cardano when it was first launched. He said that if they had held on to those Bitcoins, they would be worth approximately $12.8 billion today. However, Hoskinson pointed out that Cardano''s market capitalization is currently $30 billion, which is approximately 150% higher than the current $12 billion Bitcoin holdings. At this point, Hoskinson argued that these results show that Cardano outperforms Bitcoin by approximately 2.8x, and as a result, ADA is a significantly better investment than BTC. Hoskinson stated that Cardano has been a better investment than Bitcoin so far, adding that ADA will continue to outperform BTC. “Cardano is doing and will continue to do much more. Bitcoin will likely become BTC’s yield layer thanks to DeFi, and public chains will airdrop ADA almost annually thanks to Midnight’s launch model. Cardano''s Bitcoin DeFi will be four times larger than Ethereum and Solana''s combined DeFi. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bold Words from the Famous Founder!

A recent report from Norwegian crypto brokerage and research firm K33 Research has highlighted a critical speculative shift from Bitcoin (BTC) to Ethereum (ETH), issuing a strong warning about impending Crypto Market Volatility . For investors and enthusiasts alike, understanding these nuanced movements is paramount. Are we witnessing a major rebalancing of institutional portfolios, and what implications does this hold for the broader digital asset market? The Great Crypto Shift: Bitcoin’s Stability, Ethereum’s Surge K33 Research’s analysis reveals intriguing patterns in institutional engagement. July saw substantial corporate and ETF inflows into Bitcoin, totaling 115,165 BTC. Even after Galaxy’s 80,000 BTC OTC sale, a net inflow of 35,165 BTC confirms sustained institutional interest in BTC. However, Ethereum (ETH) was the standout performer. Ethereum recorded an impressive 52% gain in July, signaling robust demand. This surge is significantly influenced by institutional capital rotation, with smart money increasingly diversifying into ETH. This strategic reallocation is a key factor contributing to anticipated Crypto Market Volatility . While Bitcoin maintains its foundational role, Ethereum is rapidly gaining ground as a preferred institutional asset. Key Institutional Flow Highlights (July Data) Bitcoin (BTC) Inflows: Net 35,165 BTC after sales. Ethereum (ETH) Performance: 52% price appreciation in July. ETH ETF Inflows: 1.6 million ETH flowed into ETFs over six weeks. CME ETH Open Interest Dominance: CME ETH open interest climbed to 40%. These figures collectively illustrate a notable shift in institutional preference, influencing the broader dynamics of Crypto Market Volatility . Unpacking Institutional Appetite: New Phase of Crypto Market Volatility? K33 Research also examined the derivatives market. Perpetual futures open interest for Bitcoin soared past 300,000 BTC, reaching levels not seen since late 2023. This indicates renewed appetite for leveraged exposure. Notably, K33 observed neutral funding rates. These rates, crucial for market bias, often suggest significant hedging activity. This implies that while institutions take on more exposure, they are simultaneously managing risks, anticipating future price movements and heightened Crypto Market Volatility . This balance between speculation and caution creates a complex market environment prone to sudden shifts. What High Open Interest and Neutral Funding Rates Reveal: Increased Market Engagement: High open interest signifies substantial capital in derivatives. Balanced Sentiment & Hedging: Neutral funding rates suggest a market not overtly bullish or bearish, with significant hedging. Underlying Caution: Indicates institutional awareness of macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainties. This dynamic interplay underscores the market’s heightened sensitivity. Why the Pivot to Ethereum? Decoding Capital Rotation The data from K33 strongly supports a significant capital rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Ethereum’s robust ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, dApps) continues to attract substantial interest. The impressive 1.6 million ETH flowed into ETFs over six weeks, coupled with CME’s growing dominance in ETH open interest, are clear indicators of this strategic shift. Institutional investors increasingly recognize Ethereum’s multifaceted potential beyond just a digital store of value. Its utility as a platform for innovation, ongoing scalability improvements, and deflationary tokenomics post-Merge make it an attractive long-term investment. This reallocation is a major contributor to the current and future state of Crypto Market Volatility . Key Drivers of Ethereum’s Rising Appeal Vibrant Ecosystem: Largest DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Technological Evolution: Continuous upgrades enhance scalability. Growing Institutional Products: Regulated ETH-based financial products. Portfolio Diversification: Institutions recognizing Ethereum’s unique value. This evolving market narrative signifies a maturation where different digital assets fulfill distinct strategic roles for large-scale investors. Navigating the Storm: Key Triggers for Impending Crypto Market Volatility K33’s warning about heightened market volatility is tied to several high-impact events. These macroeconomic and regulatory catalysts have the potential to significantly amplify Crypto Market Volatility , creating both risks and opportunities.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $118,831. BTC has traded between $116,000 and $120,000 for two weeks, as it struggles to build momentum and push above $120,000. US Looking To Claim $2.4 million In Seized Bitcoin The US has filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of $2.4 million in Bitcoin (BTC) . The assets were seized by the Dallas FBI. The complaint, filed in the Northern District of Texas, seeks the forfeiture of 20.2 BTC seized from an associate of the Chaos group, which has been tied to several ransomware attacks. The seizure took place on April 15 after authorities alleged the assets were related to ransomware attacks. If the forfeiture is successful, the BTC could be added to the US Bitcoin reserve, which President Trump mandated through an executive order signed on March 6. The US government holds 198,012 BTC , according to estimates by Nansen, Arkham Intelligence, and BitcoinTreasuries. However, a recent freedom of information request called that figure into question. According to a journalist, the freedom of information request revealed that the United States Marshals Service (USMS) only held 28,988 BTC . However, the journalist added that the figure does not include assets held by other agencies like the FBI or the DEA. Billionaire Ray Dalio Urges Bitcoin Allocation Veteran asset manager Ray Dalio has urged investors to allocate at least 15% of their portfolio to gold and Bitcoin amid growing risks in the bond and equity markets. The Bridgewater Associates founder stated in a podcast that macroeconomic risks associated with rising government debt in the US and elsewhere have not been priced in, which could lead to a substantial decline. Dalio stated on the podcast, “The U.S. government is spending 40% more than it takes in, and it can’t really cut its spending. It’s accumulated a debt that’s six times the amount of money it takes in [...] and in interest payments that is $1 trillion per year, which is half [its] budget deficit.” He explained that the US government can pay its debts only by issuing more debt and by the Federal Reserve printing more money. This could lead to a situation where another round of quantitative easing or the government taking control of the Fed could lead to a major crash. Dalio added that because such risks are not priced into markets, investors must allocate a portion of their portfolios to gold or Bitcoin. Digital Commodities Announces Bitcoin Purchase Digital Commodities has announced the purchase of an additional 1.86 Bitcoin (BTC) using cash on hand. The total purchase price was $300,000 at an average purchase price of $160,544 BTC . The firm completed the transaction through Coinsquares'' regulated OTC trading desk, and aligns with its strategic initiative to acquire digital assets as an alternative to traditional currency. The latest acquisition takes Digital Commodities’ total Bitcoin holdings to 10.56 BTC . The company also announced Nick St. Louis as its dedicated Bitcoin strategist. Nick will guide the company in developing and executing its corporate Bitcoin strategy. This includes evaluating and deploying all options to leverage capital markets while advancing Bitcoin as a solution for currency depreciation. SEC Delays Decision On Truth Social ETF The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended the review period for the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF until September. The delay pushes the initial deadline by 45 days, giving the regulator more time to evaluate the application under its commodity-based trust share framework. The SEC has up to 240 days from the date of the filing to approve or reject an ETF proposal. The Truth Social Bitcoin ETF was filed on June 3, making the extension a part of the standard review process. The SEC stated that it needed more time to consider the proposal and any issues raised during the review period. The regulator has not made any formal objections so far. However, the ETF’s ties to Trump Media have drawn criticism about a conflict of interest and political interference.

The flagship cryptocurrency ended Sunday in positive territory, rising 1.31% to cross $119,393. However, it lost momentum on Monday, starting the week with a 1.12% decline and settling at $118,064. BTC’s drop has coincided with a broader decline in the crypto market, which is down over 1% in the past 24 hours. The flagship cryptocurrency has faced consistent selling pressure around $120,000, a level where it has faced repeated rejections.

2025-07-29 16:00:49+00:00,Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Begin Distribution: Mirroring Fall 2024 Cycle,"Bitcoin trades at a critical level, holding steady above $118,000 but failing to gain momentum for a breakout. Price action has continued to tighten over the past several days, and analysts now anticipate a major move once either key supply zones are absorbed or demand breaks below. The market sits on edge, waiting for confirmation of the next trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Builds at $117K: Cost Basis Distribution Defines Key Support Level Fresh data from CryptoQuant highlights a notable shift in long-term holder (LTH) behavior. At $118K, LTH supply began to decline, signaling the start of a distribution phase. These holders, known for accumulating during downtrends and selling into strength, are now gradually offloading their positions. This transition often marks the later stages of a bullish trend and echoes patterns from previous macro cycles. As Bitcoin struggles to break past resistance and LTHs reduce exposure, pressure continues to build. A clean breakout above the current range could reignite momentum and drive BTC to new highs, while a break below support may trigger a sharper correction. Either way, the current standoff won’t last much longer. The coming days could bring the decisive move that sets the tone for Bitcoin’s next major leg. LTH Distribution Begins As Bitcoin Mirrors Fall 2024 Pattern Top analyst Axel Adler has highlighted a key development in Bitcoin’s current structure. According to Adler, LTH supply has declined by 52,000 BTC so far, marking a significant shift in behavior. These holders, typically seen as the market’s most patient participants, are now beginning to reduce their exposure—just as Bitcoin remains locked in a tight consolidation range. This shift from accumulation to distribution closely mirrors the LTH behavior seen during fall 2024, when Bitcoin climbed from $65,000 to $100,000. In that period, long-term investors steadily sold into strength as the market pushed higher, locking in profits as late-stage momentum kicked in. Adler suggests that if the current trend continues, the distribution phase will intensify with each price leg up—just as it did in previous macro cycles. The timing of this transition is critical. Bitcoin continues to hover just below all-time highs, while altcoins have begun to show signs of increased volatility. As Ethereum and other major assets begin to move more aggressively, capital rotation may accelerate. Whether this benefits or pressures Bitcoin remains to be seen. Related Reading: TRON Sees $1B USDT Mint: Liquidity Wave Incoming? BTC Holds Steady As Tight Range Continues Bitcoin remains in a tight consolidation range between $115,724 and $122,077, with the 4-hour chart showing price currently hovering around $118,817. After bouncing from the lower boundary last week, BTC has managed to recover and now trades above the 50 SMA ($118,175), 100 SMA ($118,228), and well above the 200 SMA ($113,777). These moving averages have flattened, reflecting the ongoing equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Despite several tests of the $118K zone, BTC continues to respect the key support levels, showing resilience as selling pressure remains muted. Volume, however, remains low—suggesting that traders are still in wait-and-see mode, looking for a decisive breakout before committing to larger positions. Related Reading: Ethereum CME Futures Open Interest Hits Record $7.85B – Is ETH Overheating? The upper resistance at $122K remains untouched since mid-July, and each approach has been met with rejection. A clean break above this level with volume confirmation would signal a continuation of the broader uptrend and could trigger a move toward new all-time highs.

Bitcoin trades at a critical level, holding steady above $118,000 but failing to gain momentum for a breakout. Price action has continued to tighten over the past several days, and analysts now anticipate a major move once either key supply zones are absorbed or demand breaks below. The market sits on edge, waiting for confirmation of the next trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Builds at $117K: Cost Basis Distribution Defines Key Support Level Fresh data from CryptoQuant highlights a notable shift in long-term holder (LTH) behavior. At $118K, LTH supply began to decline, signaling the start of a distribution phase. These holders, known for accumulating during downtrends and selling into strength, are now gradually offloading their positions. This transition often marks the later stages of a bullish trend and echoes patterns from previous macro cycles. As Bitcoin struggles to break past resistance and LTHs reduce exposure, pressure continues to build. A clean breakout above the current range could reignite momentum and drive BTC to new highs, while a break below support may trigger a sharper correction. Either way, the current standoff won’t last much longer. The coming days could bring the decisive move that sets the tone for Bitcoin’s next major leg. LTH Distribution Begins As Bitcoin Mirrors Fall 2024 Pattern Top analyst Axel Adler has highlighted a key development in Bitcoin’s current structure. According to Adler, LTH supply has declined by 52,000 BTC so far, marking a significant shift in behavior. These holders, typically seen as the market’s most patient participants, are now beginning to reduce their exposure—just as Bitcoin remains locked in a tight consolidation range. This shift from accumulation to distribution closely mirrors the LTH behavior seen during fall 2024, when Bitcoin climbed from $65,000 to $100,000. In that period, long-term investors steadily sold into strength as the market pushed higher, locking in profits as late-stage momentum kicked in. Adler suggests that if the current trend continues, the distribution phase will intensify with each price leg up—just as it did in previous macro cycles. The timing of this transition is critical. Bitcoin continues to hover just below all-time highs, while altcoins have begun to show signs of increased volatility. As Ethereum and other major assets begin to move more aggressively, capital rotation may accelerate. Whether this benefits or pressures Bitcoin remains to be seen.

BTC Holds Steady As Tight Range Continues Bitcoin remains in a tight consolidation range between $115,724 and $122,077, with the 4-hour chart showing price currently hovering around $118,817. After bouncing from the lower boundary last week, BTC has managed to recover and now trades above the 50 SMA ($118,175), 100 SMA ($118,228), and well above the 200 SMA ($113,777). These moving averages have flattened, reflecting the ongoing equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Despite several tests of the $118K zone, BTC continues to respect the key support levels, showing resilience as selling pressure remains muted. Volume, however, remains low—suggesting that traders are still in wait-and-see mode, looking for a decisive breakout before committing to larger positions.

On the downside, a break below $115K would invalidate the current structure and likely lead to increased volatility. Featured image from Dall-E, chart from TradingView"

On July 29, the NASDAQ hopeful announced that it had received approximately 5,800 additional Bitcoins from Tether. With over 43,500 BTC now on its books—worth an estimated $5.15 billion—Twenty One Capital has firmly secured its position as the world’s third-largest corporate Bitcoin holder, behind only Strategy and MARA Holdings. Tether fulfills its commitment The latest entry includes two components: 1,381 BTC from a subscription agreement dated June 19, and 4,422 BTC from Tether’s existing obligations under the business combination agreement with Cantor Equity Partners (CEP), the SPAC facilitating Twenty One’s public listing. Of the 5,800 BTC added, 1,381 were acquired through a June 19 subscription agreement tied to new investor commitments, the firm said, without disclosing any further details. The remaining 4,422 BTC were contributed by Tether as part of its previously agreed obligations under the merger deal with Cantor Equity Partners (CEP)—the SPAC guiding Twenty One’s transition into a publicly traded Bitcoin-native company. In early June, Tether sent 10,500 BTC to support SoftBank’s investment in Twenty One Capital, reinforcing the Japanese firm’s position as a key stakeholder ahead of the company’s public listing. Shortly after, Tether moved another 917 BTC to a separate wallet, linked to pre-funding for investors with the option to convert their commitments into equity. Twenty One Capital wants to surpass Strategy Each Bitcoin added brings Twenty One Capital a step closer to the summit long held by Strategy. However, the gap between the two remains vast. Strategy— formerly MicroStrategy —holds an eye-watering 607,770 BTC, a figure that dwarfs even its nearest rivals and stands more than ten times above Twenty One’s current total. Sitting in the middle is MARA Holdings, the Bitcoin mining firm that holds the second spot on the leaderboard. Its reserves, comprising 50,000 BTC, while a fraction of Strategy’s, still keep it ahead of Twenty One—for now. Saylor has a “real rival” Market watchers believe Twenty One’s well-capitalized foundation and political connections give it a competitive edge. “Saylor finally has a real rival,” crypto commentator Marty Party posted on X, referring to CEO Jack Mallers’ stated intent to “raise as much capital as we possibly can to acquire Bitcoin.” Since its formation in April 2025, Twenty One Capital has positioned itself as a pure-play Bitcoin firm. It is majority-owned by Tether and Bitfinex, with SoftBank as a significant minority investor. The firm is led by Strike CEO Jack Mallers, known for his vocal advocacy of Bitcoin and his work on Lightning payments infrastructure. The company plans to go public through a SPAC merger with Cantor Equity Partners (NASDAQ: CEP). Upon completion, it will trade under the ticker symbol “XXI.” Twenty One also introduced a new performance metric—Bitcoin Per Share (BPS)—to track shareholder value in BTC terms, instead of relying on traditional earnings-per-share metrics.

2025-07-29 16:06:15+00:00,"ETHW: Flows Don''t Lie, Ethereum Regains Its Footing","Summary Ethereum''s momentum has surged, with ETHW up 85% since March, driven by renewed institutional inflows and improving ETH/BTC performance. Spot Ethereum ETFs are seeing record net inflows, nearly matching spot Bitcoin ETFs, signaling strong institutional conviction and capital rotation into ETH. Corporate adoption of Ethereum as a Treasury asset is accelerating, reinforcing ETH''s status as a credible institutional asset with significant upside potential. Despite potential short-term volatility from tariff risks, improving flows and favorable ETH/BTC dynamics make ETHW an attractive buy-on-dips opportunity. The Bitwise Ethereum ETF (NYSEARCA: ETHW ) is worth a revisit at this juncture. I last covered ETHW in March, when Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) was underperforming Bitcoin and the ETH/BTC chart was breaking down towards multi-year lows. The inflows into the spot Ethereum ETFs were also weak at the time. But in the hopes of a potential approval of staking in the U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs, I leaned towards a buy rating. ETH has picked up momentum, and ETHW is up 85% since that coverage. With crypto being an inherently volatile asset class, a constant pulse check on the momentum is important for investors to maximize returns. In this article, I''ll explore the renewed case for ETHW, the latest surge, and a focus on the ETF''s underlying asset, Ethereum. But before we dive into the article, it is worth taking a walk down memory lane on the spot Ethereum ETFs, the hurdles, and progress so far. The spot Ethereum ETFs were approved in May last year, five months after the approval of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Just like the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the fund managers introduced early fee waivers and other incentives to win investors. Despite the varying fund structures, the ETFs essentially track the same underlying asset, Ethereum. Personally, I favor BITW as a top pick for Ethereum ETFs because of Bitwise’s extensive track record in crypto ETP products. In addition to that, Bitwise already has infrastructure in place with its staking products, which gives it an edge for seamless rollout in the event that staking gets approved for the spot Ethereum ETFs. I covered this strategic positioning for stake extensively in my last ETHW coverage in March. The initial momentum for the spot Ethereum ETFs was weak compared to that of the spot Bitcoin ETF. The recent turnaround in net flows into the spot Ethereum ETFs and the recovery of ETH/BTC are encouraging signals for bulls. What’s driving this surge? Is it sustainable? Is the top near? These are the key questions this article will examine, using data and on-chain signals that support a deeper understanding of Ethereum’s current setup. ETH/BTC: Ethereum''s Comeback Signal Ethereum has steadily closed the performance gap with BTC since late April, when ETH hit the yearly low of 0.01805 BTC per ETH. That was an almost 50% drawdown from the year’s open. ETH opened the year at around 0.036 BTC per ETH. The current reversal of the downtrend against BTC is important for our analysis because a rising ETH/BTC pair shows that capital is rotating from Bitcoin into Ethereum. And it is an easy way to understand the relative strength and performance of ETH against BTC. If ETH is lagging too far behind BTC for too long and then begins to recover, that rebound typically marks a sentiment shift. ETH/BTC trend (TradingView) The Catalysts Behind the Comeback It’s an entirely different narrative when straightforward data supports Ethereum’s comeback and validates capital rotation (as the case currently is). This gives fundamental weight to ETH’s relative strength and price action. If that were not the case, then ETH’s rally would look just like a meme coin with no structural thesis. The two main catalysts behind the recent turnaround have been net inflows in the spot Ethereum ETFs and the increasing (and somewhat surprising) adoption of ETH as a corporate treasury asset. Spot Ethereum ETFs monthly net inflows (SoSoValue) Monthly net inflows into the spot Ethereum ETFs have been positive since April, steadily climbing sequentially since then, and this month’s ( July ) net inflow of $5.19 billion is gearing up to be a record month. And here''s the standout development: this month, the net inflows into the spot Ethereum ETFs have nearly matched the net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. The spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded $6.01 billion in net inflows in July (that''s just 3.9% of their total net assets of $153.2 billion). Ethereum''s $5.19 billion in net inflows so far in July represent around 24% of its total net assets of $21.3 billion. The spot Ethereum ETFs saw $1.85 billion in net inflows last week, while the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw just $73 million in net inflows.

2025-07-29 16:10:11+00:00,Crucial U.S.-China Trade Talks Conclude: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Stability?,"BitcoinWorld Crucial U.S.-China Trade Talks Conclude: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Stability? In an ever-interconnected global economy, developments in international relations can send ripples far and wide, often impacting even the most dynamic sectors like cryptocurrency. The financial world is abuzz following the conclusion of the second day of U.S.-China trade talks in Stockholm, a significant milestone in ongoing efforts to stabilize one of the world’s most critical economic relationships. This event, reported by the reliable Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, marks another crucial step in a series of high-level discussions aimed at easing trade tensions that have long cast a shadow over global markets. Decoding the Latest U.S.-China Trade Talks : A Glimmer of Hope? The recent discussions in Stockholm represent the third round of high-level trade talks between the United States and China this year. These follow previous pivotal meetings: the May 10-11 talks held in Geneva and the subsequent June 9-10 discussions in London. Each round is a painstaking process, designed to bridge significant policy gaps and foster mutual understanding between the two economic giants. The very fact that these dialogues are continuing, despite the complexities, offers a cautious sense of optimism for market participants globally. For those closely watching the pulse of the global economy, the continuation of these U.S.-China trade talks is a beacon. It signals a shared commitment, however fragile, to prevent further escalation of trade disputes. The focus now shifts to the outcomes and the potential for tangible agreements that could alleviate the uncertainty that has plagued businesses and investors alike. Understanding the Tariff Truce and Its Critical Timeline A key element of these ongoing discussions revolves around the possibility of extending the ‘grace period’ for imposing tariffs. If a three-month extension is indeed granted, the existing tariff truce between the two countries is anticipated to last until November. But what does a ‘tariff truce’ truly mean, and why is this timeline so critical? A tariff truce essentially means a temporary cessation of new tariffs or an agreement to not implement previously threatened tariffs. Tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, have been a primary weapon in the trade dispute, impacting everything from consumer goods to industrial components. Here’s why this extension is so vital: Market Stability: It provides businesses with a predictable environment, allowing them to plan supply chains, investments, and pricing without the immediate threat of new import duties. Economic Breathing Room: For economies grappling with post-pandemic recovery and inflationary pressures, avoiding new tariffs prevents additional costs that could stifle growth. Diplomatic Window: A longer truce provides more time for negotiators to work towards a comprehensive and lasting trade agreement, rather than being pressured by imminent deadlines. Investor Confidence: Reduced trade uncertainty can boost investor confidence, potentially leading to increased capital flows into various asset classes, including traditional equities and, by extension, cryptocurrencies. The November deadline looms large, making the progress achieved in Stockholm, no matter how incremental, extremely important. A failure to extend the truce could re-ignite trade tensions, leading to renewed volatility across global financial markets. Why Do U.S.-China Trade Talks Matter for Global Markets (and Your Crypto Portfolio)? It might seem distant from the world of Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the health of global trade relations, particularly between economic powerhouses like the U.S. and China, directly influences broader market sentiment. Here’s how these U.S.-China trade talks can ripple through to your digital assets: Impact Area Description Relevance to Crypto Global Economic Stability Trade peace fosters economic growth, reduces supply chain disruptions, and stabilizes commodity prices. When traditional markets are stable, investors might be more willing to take on risk in volatile assets like crypto. Conversely, instability can lead to ‘flight to safety’ or a sell-off across all asset classes. Investor Confidence Certainty in trade relations encourages investment and long-term planning. Higher investor confidence in traditional markets can spill over into crypto, attracting new capital and reducing selling pressure. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment Trade tensions often lead to a ‘risk-off’ environment where investors sell riskier assets. In a ‘risk-off’ scenario, crypto assets, especially altcoins, can see significant sell-offs. A ‘risk-on’ environment, often fostered by trade peace, can drive demand for crypto. Supply Chain Health Tariffs and trade barriers disrupt global supply chains, affecting corporate earnings and consumer prices. Disruptions can lead to broader economic slowdowns, impacting disposable income and investment ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-china-trade-talks-conclude/,MARKET|BUSINESS|ASIA|BTC|TRADING,Crypto News|Geopolitics|global economy|market stability|tariffs|Trade Negotiations,BTC,"Crucial U.S.-China Trade Talks Conclude: A Glimmer of Hope for Global Stability?.

This event, reported by the reliable Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, marks another crucial step in a series of high-level discussions aimed at easing trade tensions that have long cast a shadow over global markets. Decoding the Latest U.S.-China Trade Talks : A Glimmer of Hope? The recent discussions in Stockholm represent the third round of high-level trade talks between the United States and China this year. These follow previous pivotal meetings: the May 10-11 talks held in Geneva and the subsequent June 9-10 discussions in London. Each round is a painstaking process, designed to bridge significant policy gaps and foster mutual understanding between the two economic giants. The very fact that these dialogues are continuing, despite the complexities, offers a cautious sense of optimism for market participants globally. For those closely watching the pulse of the global economy, the continuation of these U.S.-China trade talks is a beacon. It signals a shared commitment, however fragile, to prevent further escalation of trade disputes. The focus now shifts to the outcomes and the potential for tangible agreements that could alleviate the uncertainty that has plagued businesses and investors alike. Understanding the Tariff Truce and Its Critical Timeline A key element of these ongoing discussions revolves around the possibility of extending the ‘grace period’ for imposing tariffs. If a three-month extension is indeed granted, the existing tariff truce between the two countries is anticipated to last until November. But what does a ‘tariff truce’ truly mean, and why is this timeline so critical? A tariff truce essentially means a temporary cessation of new tariffs or an agreement to not implement previously threatened tariffs. Tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, have been a primary weapon in the trade dispute, impacting everything from consumer goods to industrial components. Here’s why this extension is so vital: Market Stability: It provides businesses with a predictable environment, allowing them to plan supply chains, investments, and pricing without the immediate threat of new import duties. Economic Breathing Room: For economies grappling with post-pandemic recovery and inflationary pressures, avoiding new tariffs prevents additional costs that could stifle growth. Diplomatic Window: A longer truce provides more time for negotiators to work towards a comprehensive and lasting trade agreement, rather than being pressured by imminent deadlines. Investor Confidence: Reduced trade uncertainty can boost investor confidence, potentially leading to increased capital flows into various asset classes, including traditional equities and, by extension, cryptocurrencies. The November deadline looms large, making the progress achieved in Stockholm, no matter how incremental, extremely important. A failure to extend the truce could re-ignite trade tensions, leading to renewed volatility across global financial markets. Why Do U.S.-China Trade Talks Matter for Global Markets (and Your Crypto Portfolio)? It might seem distant from the world of Bitcoin and Ethereum, but the health of global trade relations, particularly between economic powerhouses like the U.S. and China, directly influences broader market sentiment. Here’s how these U.S.-China trade talks can ripple through to your digital assets: Impact Area Description Relevance to Crypto Global Economic Stability Trade peace fosters economic growth, reduces supply chain disruptions, and stabilizes commodity prices. When traditional markets are stable, investors might be more willing to take on risk in volatile assets like crypto. Conversely, instability can lead to ‘flight to safety’ or a sell-off across all asset classes. Investor Confidence Certainty in trade relations encourages investment and long-term planning. Higher investor confidence in traditional markets can spill over into crypto, attracting new capital and reducing selling pressure. Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment Trade tensions often lead to a ‘risk-off’ environment where investors sell riskier assets. In a ‘risk-off’ scenario, crypto assets, especially altcoins, can see significant sell-offs. A ‘risk-on’ environment, often fostered by trade peace, can drive demand for crypto. Supply Chain Health Tariffs and trade barriers disrupt global supply chains, affecting corporate earnings and consumer prices. Disruptions can lead to broader economic slowdowns, impacting disposable income and investment"
2025-07-29 16:10:35+00:00,Bitcoin Faces Pressure as Long-Term Holders Shift to Selling at $118K,"Bitcoin’s recent record-setting rally has triggered a notable shift in investor behavior, with long-term holders (LTHs) now offloading their stash, marking a potential inflection point in the market. On-chain data shows that LTHs, who typically hold Bitcoin for more than 155 days, have shed 52,000 BTC since the price reached its latest peak. Long-Term Holders Mirror Previous Distribution Cycles On July 29, analyst Axel Adler Jr. highlighted on X that LTH supply has dropped by 52,000 BTC at the $118,000 level, signaling a decisive shift from accumulation to distribution. “The shift in balance from accumulation to distribution exactly repeats the LTH pattern from fall 2024 when the price rose from $65K to $100K,” Adler noted, suggesting that profit-taking could intensify as prices climb further. This activity has also coincided with mounting pressure on short-term holders (STHs). According to recent analysis by CryptoQuant, wallets holding BTC for one to three months now sit on just 13% unrealized profits, down from 69% earlier in the cycle and a fraction of the 232% and 150% gains seen at the 2012 and 2021 peaks. Adding to the complexity, Matrixport also warned of a potential “tactical pause” for Bitcoin as macro events, including the Federal Reserve’s rate decision and a White House report on digital assets, loom over the market. Historically, August and September have been among Bitcoin’s weakest months, compounding the risk of a near-term pullback despite a broadly bullish outlook for the end of the year. Price Action and Market Sentiment At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $118,979, up slightly by 0.6% in the last seven days and 10.8% over the past month. It has traded in a tight 24-hour range between $117,498 and $119,026, reflecting waning momentum after a strong mid-July pump. While the asset is still 71% higher year-over-year, it remains 3.2% below its all-time high, and the shift in holder behavior is starting to weigh on sentiment. However, some market watchers remain unfazed. Rekt Capital, for instance, noted on July 28 that Bitcoin’s weekly close above $119,200 had formed a bullish “flag” breakout structure, potentially paving the way for further gains if the level is successfully retested as support. Meanwhile, fellow analyst CrypNeuvo flagged a potential short-term dip toward $114,300 to fill a CME gap before any renewed push higher. If history repeats, this distribution period could provide an entry point for strategic buyers. But with LTH selling accelerating and short-term profits thinning, BTC’s next move hinges on whether it can hold $118,000, or risk a sharper shakeout before its next leg up.

This isn’t a futuristic fantasy anymore. A significant legislative push is underway in the United States that could fundamentally reshape how financial institutions view your digital wealth when you apply for a home loan. U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced a groundbreaking bill that aims to require lenders to consider applicants’ cryptocurrency holdings as a legitimate factor in mortgage loan approvals. This move has the potential to revolutionize crypto mortgages and democratize access to the housing market for millions of crypto enthusiasts. Understanding the Proposed Legislation on Crypto Mortgages At its core, Senator Lummis’ bill seeks to modernize the traditional mortgage lending framework by integrating digital assets into the financial assessment process. Currently, most financial institutions primarily focus on traditional income sources, credit scores, and conventional assets when evaluating mortgage applications. The proposed legislation challenges this long-standing practice, aiming to provide a clearer path for individuals who have accumulated significant wealth in cryptocurrencies but might not fit the conventional borrower profile. According to reports, including those by Watcher Guru via X, the bill’s intent is clear: to ensure that crypto holdings are not just acknowledged but are actively factored into an applicant’s financial standing. This means: Broader Asset Recognition: Lenders would be mandated to consider a broader spectrum of assets, moving beyond just fiat currency and traditional investments. Increased Accessibility: It could significantly increase the pool of eligible homebuyers, especially younger generations who have invested heavily in digital assets. Regulatory Clarity: The bill aims to provide much-needed regulatory clarity for financial institutions, guiding them on how to assess and value volatile digital assets for loan purposes. This initiative represents a pivotal moment, bridging the gap between the rapidly evolving digital economy and the historically conservative traditional financial system. Why Now? The Growing Need for Crypto Mortgages The timing of Senator Lummis’ bill is no coincidence. The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly over the past decade, with millions of Americans now holding substantial portions of their wealth in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital currencies. However, despite this growth, these assets have largely remained on the sidelines when it comes to major financial transactions like home purchases. The current landscape presents a paradox: Many individuals possess substantial wealth in crypto. Traditional lenders often do not recognize this wealth adequately for mortgage qualification. This creates a barrier to entry for potential homeowners, forcing them to liquidate their crypto holdings, often incurring significant tax events or missing out on potential gains. Senator Lummis, a known advocate for cryptocurrency, recognizes this disconnect. Her bill seeks to address this by acknowledging the legitimacy of crypto as a form of wealth, thereby aligning financial regulations with the realities of modern investment portfolios. This legislative push is a testament to the growing influence of digital assets in mainstream finance. Potential Benefits of Adopting Crypto Mortgages The implications of this bill, if passed, are far-reaching, promising a host of benefits for both consumers and the broader financial ecosystem. Let’s explore some of the key advantages: For Homebuyers: Unlocking New Opportunities For individuals holding significant crypto assets, this bill could be a game-changer. It offers: Diversified Asset Utilization: Homebuyers could potentially use their crypto holdings without needing to convert them to fiat, avoiding potential capital gains taxes or unfavorable market timing. Increased Purchasing Power: For those with substantial unrealized gains in crypto, this could unlock significant purchasing power for larger homes or entry into more competitive markets. Financial Inclusion: It could provide pathways to homeownership for individuals who might not have traditional employment histories or substantial fiat savings but are rich in digital assets. For Financial Institutions: Expanding the Market While seemingly a challenge, this legislation also presents opportunities for lenders: New Customer Segment: Tapping into the rapidly growing crypto-rich demographic.

2025-07-29 16:25:10+00:00,US China Trade Truce: Crucial Extension Signals Global Stability,"BitcoinWorld US China Trade Truce: Crucial Extension Signals Global Stability In the often turbulent waters of global economics and geopolitics, news of stability can send ripples of relief, especially for those navigating the volatile seas of cryptocurrency. Recently, a significant announcement emerged that has captured the attention of markets worldwide: the US China trade truce has been extended. This development, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, represents more than just a diplomatic handshake; it’s a pivotal moment with far-reaching implications for international trade, economic growth, and potentially, the very trajectory of digital assets. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding such macroeconomic shifts is paramount. The intricate dance between the world’s two largest economies directly influences investor sentiment, capital flows, and the overall risk appetite that often dictates the ebb and flow of the crypto market. Let’s delve into what this extension truly means and why it’s a critical piece of the global economic puzzle. Understanding the Extended US China Trade Truce The concept of a ‘trade truce’ might sound like a temporary pause in hostilities, and in many ways, it is. It signifies an agreement between the United States and China to refrain from escalating tariffs or imposing new trade restrictions, at least for a defined period. This latest extension is a continuation of previous agreements, designed to provide a much-needed period of predictability and calm after years of tit-for-tat tariffs and trade disputes that began in 2018. The initial trade tensions stemmed from various issues, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and massive trade imbalances. These disputes led to billions of dollars in tariffs on goods exchanged between the two nations, impacting supply chains, consumer prices, and corporate profits globally. The truce, therefore, is not a resolution of these deep-seated issues but rather a strategic decision by both superpowers to de-escalate and create space for ongoing dialogue. The confirmation of this extension, as reported by Walter Bloomberg, provides official acknowledgment of this continued commitment. It suggests that despite persistent geopolitical rivalries and economic competition, both Washington and Beijing recognize the mutual benefits of maintaining open, if cautious, lines of communication and trade, preventing further disruption to an already fragile global economy. The extension of the US China trade truce brings a renewed sense of stability to global markets. US China Trade Truce: Crucial Extension Signals Global Stability Why is this US China Trade Truce So Significant for Global Markets? The relationship between the U.S. and China is arguably the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world, influencing everything from manufacturing and technology to finance and commodity prices. An extended US China trade truce sends powerful signals across various sectors: Reduced Uncertainty: Businesses thrive on predictability. The truce removes the immediate threat of new tariffs, allowing companies to plan investments, manage supply chains, and make hiring decisions with greater confidence. This stability is particularly crucial for multinational corporations heavily reliant on both Chinese production and American consumption. Boost to Global Trade: While not a full trade agreement, the truce prevents a further contraction of global trade volumes. This is beneficial for shipping, logistics, and manufacturing industries worldwide, as goods can flow more freely without punitive tariffs. Commodity Market Stability: Major commodity prices, from oil to agricultural products, are often sensitive to US-China relations. A truce typically reduces price volatility, which is good news for economies reliant on these exports and for consumers. Investor Confidence: When geopolitical tensions ease, investors tend to shift from ‘risk-off’ assets (like gold or certain government bonds) to ‘risk-on’ assets (like equities and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies). This renewed confidence can fuel market rallies and attract new capital. To illustrate the shift, consider the impact of previous phases: Phase Key Characteristics Market Impact Trade War Escalation (2018-2019) Imposition of widespread tariffs, tit-for-tat responses, heightened rhetoric. Increased market volatility, supply chain disruptions, investor uncertainty, decline in global trade. Phase One Deal (2020) Partial agreement, China committed to purchasing more US goods, some tariff reductions. Temporary market relief, improved sentiment, partial recovery in trade volumes.

BitcoinWorld US China Trade Truce: Crucial Extension Signals Global Stability In the often turbulent waters of global economics and geopolitics, news of stability can send ripples of relief, especially for those navigating the volatile seas of cryptocurrency. Recently, a significant announcement emerged that has captured the attention of markets worldwide: the US China trade truce has been extended. This development, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, represents more than just a diplomatic handshake; it’s a pivotal moment with far-reaching implications for international trade, economic growth, and potentially, the very trajectory of digital assets. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding such macroeconomic shifts is paramount. The intricate dance between the world’s two largest economies directly influences investor sentiment, capital flows, and the overall risk appetite that often dictates the ebb and flow of the crypto market. Let’s delve into what this extension truly means and why it’s a critical piece of the global economic puzzle. Understanding the Extended US China Trade Truce The concept of a ‘trade truce’ might sound like a temporary pause in hostilities, and in many ways, it is. It signifies an agreement between the United States and China to refrain from escalating tariffs or imposing new trade restrictions, at least for a defined period. This latest extension is a continuation of previous agreements, designed to provide a much-needed period of predictability and calm after years of tit-for-tat tariffs and trade disputes that began in 2018. The initial trade tensions stemmed from various issues, including intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and massive trade imbalances. These disputes led to billions of dollars in tariffs on goods exchanged between the two nations, impacting supply chains, consumer prices, and corporate profits globally. The truce, therefore, is not a resolution of these deep-seated issues but rather a strategic decision by both superpowers to de-escalate and create space for ongoing dialogue. The confirmation of this extension, as reported by Walter Bloomberg, provides official acknowledgment of this continued commitment. It suggests that despite persistent geopolitical rivalries and economic competition, both Washington and Beijing recognize the mutual benefits of maintaining open, if cautious, lines of communication and trade, preventing further disruption to an already fragile global economy. The extension of the US China trade truce brings a renewed sense of stability to global markets. US China Trade Truce: Crucial Extension Signals Global Stability Why is this US China Trade Truce So Significant for Global Markets? The relationship between the U.S. and China is arguably the most consequential bilateral relationship in the world, influencing everything from manufacturing and technology to finance and commodity prices. An extended US China trade truce sends powerful signals across various sectors: Reduced Uncertainty: Businesses thrive on predictability. The truce removes the immediate threat of new tariffs, allowing companies to plan investments, manage supply chains, and make hiring decisions with greater confidence. This stability is particularly crucial for multinational corporations heavily reliant on both Chinese production and American consumption. Boost to Global Trade: While not a full trade agreement, the truce prevents a further contraction of global trade volumes. This is beneficial for shipping, logistics, and manufacturing industries worldwide, as goods can flow more freely without punitive tariffs. Commodity Market Stability: Major commodity prices, from oil to agricultural products, are often sensitive to US-China relations. A truce typically reduces price volatility, which is good news for economies reliant on these exports and for consumers. Investor Confidence: When geopolitical tensions ease, investors tend to shift from ‘risk-off’ assets (like gold or certain government bonds) to ‘risk-on’ assets (like equities and, increasingly, cryptocurrencies). This renewed confidence can fuel market rallies and attract new capital. To illustrate the shift, consider the impact of previous phases: Phase Key Characteristics Market Impact Trade War Escalation (2018-2019) Imposition of widespread tariffs, tit-for-tat responses, heightened rhetoric. Increased market volatility, supply chain disruptions, investor uncertainty, decline in global trade. Phase One Deal (2020) Partial agreement, China committed to purchasing more US goods, some tariff reductions. Temporary market relief, improved sentiment, partial recovery in trade volumes.

Sustained market stability, reduced geopolitical risk premium, potential for ‘risk-on’ capital flows. Navigating the Challenges and Opportunities of the Extended US China Trade Truce Whil"
2025-07-29 16:30:07+00:00,This Week In Bitcoin: 4 Things To Keep An Eye On That Could Impact Price,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade in a volatile yet increasingly bullish market , a crypto analyst points to key developments that could drive a breakout past $130,000 . From macroeconomic shifts to major technical breakouts and unexpected geopolitical tailwinds, the analyst outlines four critical factors to watch this week that could significantly impact BTC’s price action. The Trump-EU Trade Deal On July 27, crypto analyst Doctor Profit posted a detailed macro report on X social media, highlighting Bitcoin and certain bullish events unfolding around it. Before addressing the latest US trade developments , the market expert noted that Bitcoin recently pulled off a major technical move that went largely unnoticed by the market. After facing four consecutive months of rejection from November 2024 to February 2025, BTC finally broke through a long-term diagonal resistance tied to its 2021 all-time high . It then retested the level as support and followed through with a strong bullish move. On the macro front, Doctor Pillows suggested that a significant shift in the global trade policy could fuel Bitcoin’s continued upward momentum. He highlighted President Donald Trump’s announcement of a landmark trade agreement between the US and European Union, easing fears of a potential tariff war . The analyst described this deal as one of the most bullish trade agreements since 2016, noting that markets are likely to respond positively to the reduced geopolitical risks . With stocks set to open higher and economic friction easing between two of the world’s largest economies, Bitcoin also stands to benefit from the improved macro environment . Whale Panic Vs. ETF Power Earlier this week, Bitcoin saw a brief drop to $114,500 after wallet activity from Galaxy Digital sparked concerns of a potential selloff. However, according to Doctor Profit, those fears quickly faded as spot ETF inflows continued to outpace Bitcoin’s daily issuance. Institutions like BlackRock are also steadily absorbing supply, reinforcing strong underlying demand. Most importantly, the analyst highlighted that many long-term whale wallets remain inactive, indicating that the broader accumulation trend is still intact. Rather than signaling weakness, Doctor Profit suggests that the recent price dip appeared to have been a temporary shakeout that highlights the strength of the ongoing bull market . M2 Money Supply Sees Increase In his report, Doctor Profit stated that Bitcoin’s real macro engine is emerging from M2 Money Supply growth. Despite ongoing narratives around quantitative tightening, the analyst highlights that M2 has risen by 2.3% in 2025 so far, including a sharp 0.63% spike between May and June— the largest monthly increase this year. Historically, Bitcoin has closely followed M2 expansion , as seen during the 2020 liquidity surge that fueled an 800% rally. While exact outcomes vary, Doctor Profit suggests that the current pace of growth points to a potential 15-17.5% BTC rally to above $130,000 in the coming weeks, based on the cryptocurrency’s typical 60-90 day lag in reacting to monetary expansion. FOMC Meeting And Potential Rate Cut As his final bullish point, Doctor Profit mentioned the next FOMC meeting on Wednesday. While the official stance remains “hawkish,” with only a 5% chance of a rate cut, the analyst noted that the Federal Reserve (FED) has been quietly expanding liquidity and printing. This growing disconnect between Chair Jerome Powell ’s rhetoric and the FED’s actual monetary actions is noteworthy. It suggests that the FED may already be laying the groundwork for the next round of quantitative easing. Given Bitcoin’s historical sensitivity to monetary policy shifts , the cryptocurrency may be well-positioned to rally significantly once the pivot becomes more apparent.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/this-week-in-bitcoin/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA,Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|BlackRock|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Doctor Pillows|Doctor Profit|Donald Trump|Fed|Federal Reserve|FOMC meeting|Galaxy Digital|Global M2 Money Supply|Jerome Powell,BTC,"This Week In Bitcoin: 4 Things To Keep An Eye On That Could Impact Price.

Recently, Charles Hoskinson, the visionary founder of Cardano (ADA), made a statement that has sent ripples across the crypto community: he believes ADA’s unit price could appreciate an astonishing 1,000 times, a feat he suggests is beyond Bitcoin’s reach. This declaration, as reported by The Crypto Basic, not only highlights Hoskinson’s conviction in his creation but also reignites the long-standing debate about the future leadership of the blockchain space. This profound belief in Cardano potential comes amidst his recent criticism of suggestions to convert the ADA treasury into Bitcoin, underscoring a fundamental divergence in philosophy and strategic direction. Decoding Charles Hoskinson’s Vision for Cardano Potential Charles Hoskinson isn’t one to shy away from controversial opinions, and his latest comments are no exception. His assertion that Cardano could achieve a 1,000x price appreciation while Bitcoin cannot is rooted in his deep understanding of blockchain technology and market dynamics. For many, Bitcoin, the progenitor of cryptocurrencies, represents digital gold – a store of value. Its design prioritizes security and decentralization above all else, leading to a relatively fixed supply and a robust, albeit less flexible, network. Hoskinson’s perspective on Cardano potential, however, is dramatically different. He envisions Cardano not merely as a digital asset, but as a foundational platform for a new global financial and social operating system. This distinction is crucial: Bitcoin’s Role: Primarily a store of value and a medium of exchange, designed for scarcity and censorship resistance. Its fixed supply and proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism contribute to its robust security but also limit its scalability and flexibility for complex applications. Cardano’s Ambition: Aims to be a programmable blockchain platform, supporting smart contracts, decentralized applications (dApps), and complex financial instruments. Its proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, Ouroboros, is designed for scalability, sustainability, and energy efficiency, offering a different paradigm for growth. The 1,000x prediction for Cardano potential isn’t just a number; it reflects a belief in ADA’s capacity to absorb significant global value by becoming an indispensable infrastructure layer for various industries, from finance and supply chain to identity management and governance. Why Does Charles Hoskinson See Such Immense Cardano Potential? The core of Hoskinson’s argument for Cardano’s exponential growth lies in its unique architecture and development philosophy. Unlike many other blockchains that prioritize speed to market, Cardano has adopted a research-driven, peer-reviewed approach, emphasizing security, scalability, and sustainability from the ground up. Here are some key differentiators that fuel his optimism regarding Cardano potential: Scientific Rigor and Peer Review: Every major development on Cardano undergoes rigorous academic peer review, ensuring a robust and secure foundation. This methodical approach minimizes vulnerabilities and builds a highly reliable network. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) & Ouroboros: Cardano’s Ouroboros PoS protocol is significantly more energy-efficient and scalable than Bitcoin’s PoW. This allows for higher transaction throughput and lower fees, crucial for widespread adoption. Layered Architecture: Cardano employs a layered architecture, separating the settlement layer (for transactions) from the computation layer (for smart contracts). This design enhances flexibility, scalability, and allows for future upgrades without disrupting the entire network. Smart Contract Capabilities: With the Alonzo hard fork, Cardano gained full smart contract functionality, opening doors for a vast ecosystem of DeFi applications, NFTs, and more. This programmable nature is a fundamental difference from Bitcoin. Interoperability: Cardano is designed with interoperability in mind, aiming to connect with other blockchains and traditional financial systems, facilitating seamless value transfer and data exchange across disparate networks. Treasury System and Governance: Cardano features an on-chain treasury system funded by transaction fees, governed by the community through Project Catalyst. This decentralized funding mechanism supports ongoing development and innovation, ensuring the network’s long-term sustainability and growth. These architectural choices, according to Hoskinson, provide Cardano with a superior foundation to scale and integrate into the global economy in ways that Bitcoin, by its very design, cannot. This foundational strength is what underpins the belief in such massive Cardano potential.

2025-07-29 16:37:33+00:00,Crypto Has a Comms Issue,"Earlier this month, NPR ran a headline, “Why there''s so much excitement around a cryptocurrency called stablecoin.” If you want to understand where crypto stands with legacy media in 2025, start there. The piece was a basic primer on a decade-old innovation that settles nearly $27 trillion annually, surpassing the combined annual transaction volume of Visa and Mastercard. Stablecoins are not new, and neither is the media’s incuriosity about them. It was the most recent proofpoint that in the eyes of legacy media, crypto remains suspended in a state of perpetual novelty. The gap between crypto’s market performance and the stories told about it reveals a deeper communications failure. It keeps the public in the dark about transformative advances in a $4 trillion industry. Today, Bitcoin is up over 110% year-to-date. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $50 billion in net inflows, marking one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Global crypto adoption has surpassed 600 million users, with countries like Turkey, Argentina, and the UAE reporting that nearly one in three adults own crypto. Consumer products are also taking off. Decentralized prediction market Polymarket has seen over $100 million in volume on the 2024 U.S. election alone, and is reportedly on track for a $1 billion valuation. Beneath the surface, on-chain rails are quietly powering a new global financial infrastructure. However, mainstream media narratives have failed to keep up. According to a report by Perception, while Bitcoin posted record performance in Q2 2024, The Wall Street Journal published just two articles on Bitcoin and crypto. The Financial Times and The New York Times, respectively managed only eleven, compared to 141 by CNBC and 65 by Barron’s. This lack of coverage in top financial outlets means that one of the most important financial and technological innovations of our time is not reaching investors, policymakers, and the public. The gap between market signals and coverage in crypto is an existential liability and has dire political, regulatory and cultural consequences. For many Americans, crypto is still a spectacle – seen as volatile, unserious and untrustworthy. Legislation is based as much on perception as it is on principle. Markets respond to narratives as much as numbers, and voters form opinions through headlines. This isn’t just a branding problem, but a structural issue rooted in how Bitcoin and crypto has let the world tell its story – and often, get it wrong. The industry did not just lose public trust during the last cycle. It lost the plot. In pursuing mass appeal, the industry opted for spectacle over substance: with stadium naming rights, Super Bowl ads, and celebrity campaigns. It borrowed legitimacy, rather than cultivating its own. When FTX, BlockFi, and Celsius imploded, the public had no coherent story to fall back on. Today, Bitcoin’s success is grounded in real market signals – not projections, ideals, or hypotheticals.

Earlier this month, NPR ran a headline, “Why there''s so much excitement around a cryptocurrency called stablecoin.” If you want to understand where crypto stands with legacy media in 2025, start there. The piece was a basic primer on a decade-old innovation that settles nearly $27 trillion annually, surpassing the combined annual transaction volume of Visa and Mastercard. Stablecoins are not new, and neither is the media’s incuriosity about them. It was the most recent proofpoint that in the eyes of legacy media, crypto remains suspended in a state of perpetual novelty. The gap between crypto’s market performance and the stories told about it reveals a deeper communications failure. It keeps the public in the dark about transformative advances in a $4 trillion industry. Today, Bitcoin is up over 110% year-to-date. U.S.-listed Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $50 billion in net inflows, marking one of the most successful ETF launches in history. Global crypto adoption has surpassed 600 million users, with countries like Turkey, Argentina, and the UAE reporting that nearly one in three adults own crypto. Consumer products are also taking off. Decentralized prediction market Polymarket has seen over $100 million in volume on the 2024 U.S. election alone, and is reportedly on track for a $1 billion valuation. Beneath the surface, on-chain rails are quietly powering a new global financial infrastructure. However, mainstream media narratives have failed to keep up. According to a report by Perception, while Bitcoin posted record performance in Q2 2024, The Wall Street Journal published just two articles on Bitcoin and crypto.

2025-07-29 16:40:12+00:00,Ethereum ETFs: The Astonishing Surge Reshaping Crypto Investments,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETFs: The Astonishing Surge Reshaping Crypto Investments The world of cryptocurrency investment is witnessing a fascinating shift, and at the heart of this transformation are Ethereum ETFs . For years, Bitcoin has reigned supreme, dominating headlines and investment portfolios. However, recent data suggests a compelling narrative unfolding, one where Ethereum is not just catching up but actively reshaping the landscape of digital asset investments. This isn’t just a minor blip on the radar; it’s a significant realignment that demands attention from every investor, enthusiast, and market observer. Are Ethereum ETFs Truly Reshaping the Crypto Landscape? Absolutely. The buzz around Ethereum ETFs is more than just market chatter; it’s backed by concrete data. Bloomberg exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst Eric Balchunas recently highlighted a remarkable trend on X (formerly Twitter): the rising inflows into Ethereum ETFs are undeniably eating away at Bitcoin’s long-held market share. This isn’t a speculative prediction but an observation of current market dynamics. Just two months ago, Bitcoin ETFs commanded a staggering 90% of total crypto ETF assets under management (AUM). Today, that figure has dropped to 82%. In contrast, Ethereum’s slice of the pie has grown to a significant 13% and continues its upward trajectory. This shift indicates a growing investor appetite for diversification beyond just Bitcoin, recognizing Ethereum’s unique value proposition. While Balchunas maintains his prediction that Ethereum will not surpass 20% of the total crypto ETF AUM, citing the inevitable emergence of more competitors as other crypto-related ETFs gain regulatory approval, the current momentum for Ethereum ETFs is undeniable and powerful. This indicates a maturing market where investors are seeking broader exposure to the digital asset ecosystem. What’s Driving the Astonishing Surge in Ethereum ETFs ? The impressive ascent of Ethereum ETFs isn’t accidental; it’s a culmination of several key factors that make Ethereum a compelling investment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the broader implications for the crypto market: Ethereum’s Foundational Utility: Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily a store of value, Ethereum serves as the backbone for a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 initiatives. This utility makes Ethereum more than just a digital currency; it’s a programmable blockchain that underpins innovation. Regulatory Clarity and Institutional Acceptance: The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs paved the way, signaling a growing acceptance of crypto-backed financial products by regulatory bodies. This precedent has instilled greater confidence in institutions and traditional investors regarding the viability and legitimacy of Ethereum ETFs . Enhanced Accessibility for Traditional Investors: ETFs offer a familiar and regulated investment vehicle, allowing individuals and institutions to gain exposure to Ethereum without the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as setting up wallets or managing private keys. This ease of access significantly broadens the investor base. Diversification Benefits: As the crypto market matures, investors are increasingly looking for diversification beyond just Bitcoin. Ethereum, with its distinct use cases and market dynamics, offers an attractive alternative to balance a crypto portfolio. Anticipation of Future Upgrades: Ethereum’s continuous development, including upcoming upgrades focused on scalability, efficiency, and security (like the Dencun and Pectra upgrades), fuels optimism about its long-term potential and intrinsic value. These combined factors create a powerful tailwind for Ethereum ETFs , positioning them as a critical component in the evolving digital asset investment landscape. How Do Ethereum ETFs Compare to Bitcoin ETFs? While both Ethereum ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs offer investors regulated exposure to cryptocurrencies, their underlying assets and market dynamics present interesting distinctions. Understanding these differences helps in appreciating the current market shifts: Market Dominance: Historically, Bitcoin has held an overwhelming share of the crypto market, reflected in its ETF AUM. However, as Eric Balchunas pointed out, Ethereum ETFs are now actively chipping away at this dominance, indicating a more diversified interest from investors. Use Cases: Bitcoin is often seen as ‘digital gold’ – a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a platform for innovation. Its smart contract capabilities enable a vast array of decentralized applications, giving it a different value proposition and growth potential linked to the adoption of Web3 technologies.

2025-07-29 16:45:10+00:00,Urgent Alert: Crypto Whale Liquidation Averted by AguilaTrades on Hyperliquid,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: Crypto Whale Liquidation Averted by AguilaTrades on Hyperliquid The cryptocurrency market is a realm of exhilarating highs and nerve-wracking lows, where fortunes can be made or lost in the blink of an eye. At the heart of this volatile ecosystem are ‘whales’ – powerful entities whose colossal holdings and strategic moves can send ripples, or even tsunamis, across the digital ocean. Recently, the crypto community watched with bated breath as one such titan, known as AguilaTrades on the Hyperliquid platform, made a critical decision to avoid a catastrophic Crypto Whale Liquidation event. This isn’t just a story about numbers; it’s a vivid illustration of the high stakes, immense pressures, and strategic maneuvers that define the world of large-scale crypto trading. Decoding the AguilaTrades Saga: Averting a Crypto Whale Liquidation The news broke through Lookonchain on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that AguilaTrades, a prominent figure on the Hyperliquid exchange, had taken decisive action. To prevent the forced closure of his highly leveraged positions – a process known as liquidation – he opted to voluntarily close a significant portion of his long Bitcoin (BTC) holdings. This move, while strategic, came at a steep price, highlighting the inherent risks in the pursuit of amplified gains. What exactly happened? The Trader: AguilaTrades, identified as a significant ‘whale’ on Hyperliquid. The Action: Voluntarily closed part of extensive long BTC positions. The Reason: To preemptively avoid a full-scale crypto whale liquidation , which would have resulted in even greater losses. Current Holdings: Post-closure, AguilaTrades still holds a substantial 1,000 BTC, valued at approximately $117.65 million at the time of the report. The Cost: The strategic exit resulted in total losses exceeding a staggering $38 million. This incident serves as a stark reminder that even the most experienced and well-capitalized traders are not immune to the market’s unpredictable swings. The decision to cut losses, though painful, underscores a fundamental principle of risk management in highly leveraged trading environments. Who Are Crypto Whales and Why Do Their Moves Matter? In the vast ocean of cryptocurrency, ‘whales’ are individuals or entities that hold exceptionally large amounts of digital assets, typically enough to influence market prices. Their sheer volume of holdings gives them significant power, and their trading activities are closely scrutinized by market observers. Why are they so important? Market Movers: A large buy or sell order from a whale can cause significant price fluctuations, impacting the portfolios of countless smaller traders. Sentiment Indicators: Whale movements are often seen as indicators of broader market sentiment. If whales are accumulating, it might signal confidence; if they’re offloading, it could suggest a downturn. Liquidity Providers: They often provide substantial liquidity to exchanges, facilitating smoother trading, but their sudden withdrawals can create liquidity crunches. Potential for Cascading Effects: A forced crypto whale liquidation , especially on a large scale, can trigger a domino effect, leading to further price drops as collateral is sold off. AguilaTrades’ decision to avoid liquidation wasn’t just about his personal finances; it potentially prevented a larger ripple effect that could have exacerbated market volatility for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Understanding Liquidation in Crypto Trading: A Trader’s Nightmare For anyone involved in leveraged trading, ‘liquidation’ is a word that sends shivers down the spine. It’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. When the value of a trader’s collateral falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically sells off the assets to prevent further losses to itself and to ensure the debt is covered. How Liquidation Works in a Nutshell: Term Explanation Leverage Borrowing funds to amplify potential returns (and risks) from a trade. For example, 10x leverage means you trade with 10 times your capital. Margin The collateral (your own funds) deposited with the exchange to open and maintain a leveraged position. Margin Call A notification from the exchange requesting a trader to deposit more funds into their margin account to avoid liquidation. Liquidation Price A specific price point at which the value of a trader’s collateral becomes insufficient, triggering the automatic closure of the position. Forced Closure The automatic selling of a trader’s assets by the exchange to cover losses and outstanding borrowed funds. This often happens at unfavorable market prices. The danger for a crypto whale liquidation is amplified by the sheer size of their positions.

The company’s open-ended buyback, revealed July 29 , allows it to repurchase shares via open-market or private deals, with no expiry. It’s the latest move in BitMine’s escalating bid to accumulate 5% of Ethereum’s total supply. BitMine to Repurchase Shares as Part of Long-Term Ethereum Strategy 1/ Bitmine is today announcing a $1 billion stock repurchase program. Per Tom Lee @fundstrat , Chairman of Bitmine: “In our road to achieving ‘the alchemy of 5%’ of ETH, there may be times when the best expected return of our capital is to acquire our own shares” ticker:… — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 29, 2025 “In our road to achieving ‘the alchemy of 5%,’ there may be times when the best expected return of our capital is to acquire our own shares,” said chairman Tom Lee, who also leads Fundstrat. With ETH trading at $3,755 and BTC at $118,021 on July 28, BitMine’s net asset value per share hit $22.76, bolstered by $401.4 million in unencumbered cash, 192 BTC, and its ETH treasury. The announcement comes just days after BitMine revealed its goal to acquire and stake 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, approximately six million ETH, depending on Ethereum’s issuance. If successful, the company would hold a larger share of ETH than MicroStrategy does of Bitcoin. Just last week, the company revealed a stunning 566,776 ETH purchase in only 16 days , worth $2.03 billion at the time, vaulting it ahead of rivals like SharpLink Gaming and even the Ethereum Foundation. BMNR shares have exploded more than 3,000% since early July, reaching $135 following the announcement of its Ether accumulation plan. The company’s options on its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in July , giving investors new tools to engage with the company’s equity. Meanwhile, competitors are scrambling to catch up. SharpLink added 77,210 ETH over the weekend, bringing its total to 438,017 ETH, worth $1.7 billion. But BitMine still holds the lead in what’s shaping up to be the crypto space’s most aggressive treasury accumulation race. Institutional Accumulation and On-chain Trends Indicate Structural Bullishness for ETH Currently, 6.73% of all ETH, or about 8.12 million tokens worth over $31 billion, is held collectively by corporations and ETFs, according to data from Strategic ETH Reserve (SER). The total strategic Ethereum reserves account for 2.33 million ETH, valued at $8.9 billion and representing 1.93% of the total ETH supply. The reserves include 65 participants and have seen a steady increase in holdings since mid-April, with a sharp rise beginning in late June. Meanwhile, ETH ETFs hold 5.82 million ETH , valued at $22.23 billion. Inflows have been consistent, with 17 consecutive days of net additions totaling more than 433,000 ETH during the past week alone. This uptick reflects renewed institutional interest and capital allocation to Ethereum-based products. Combined, the Ethereum reserves and ETFs now hold nearly 7% of the entire ETH supply. Ethereum’s supply dynamics continue to show bullish structural signs. Over 34 million ETH, around 28% of the total 120.7 million supply, is currently staked. This staked amount is effectively locked and unavailable for trading, reducing the liquid supply and indicating long-term investor confidence. Exchange balances have also hit a multi-year low of 16.2 million ETH, the lowest level since 2016. This drop in sell-side liquidity supports upward price pressure, especially as demand increases. According to Glassnode, the amount of ETH held by first-time buyers has risen by 16% since early July, hinting at a fresh wave of retail and institutional adoption. Analysts at Glassnode called it the first meaningful trend reversal in recent ETH cycles.

BMNR shares have exploded more than 3,000% since early July, reaching $135 following the announcement of its Ether accumulation plan. The company’s options on its stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in July , giving investors new tools to engage with the company’s equity. Meanwhile, competitors are scrambling to catch up. SharpLink added 77,210 ETH over the weekend, bringing its total to 438,017 ETH, worth $1.7 billion. But BitMine still holds the lead in what’s shaping up to be the crypto space’s most aggressive treasury accumulation race. Institutional Accumulation and On-chain Trends Indicate Structural Bullishness for ETH Currently, 6.73% of all ETH, or about 8.12 million tokens worth over $31 billion, is held collectively by corporations and ETFs, according to data from Strategic ETH Reserve (SER). The total strategic Ethereum reserves account for 2.33 million ETH, valued at $8.9 billion and representing 1.93% of the total ETH supply. The reserves include 65 participants and have seen a steady increase in holdings since mid-April, with a sharp rise beginning in late June. Meanwhile, ETH ETFs hold 5.82 million ETH , valued at $22.23 billion. Inflows have been consistent, with 17 consecutive days of net additions totaling more than 433,000 ETH during the past week alone. This uptick reflects renewed institutional interest and capital allocation to Ethereum-based products. Combined, the Ethereum reserves and ETFs now hold nearly 7% of the entire ETH supply. Ethereum’s supply dynamics continue to show bullish structural signs. Over 34 million ETH, around 28% of the total 120.7 million supply, is currently staked. This staked amount is effectively locked and unavailable for trading, reducing the liquid supply and indicating long-term investor confidence. Exchange balances have also hit a multi-year low of 16.2 million ETH, the lowest level since 2016. This drop in sell-side liquidity supports upward price pressure, especially as demand increases. According to Glassnode, the amount of ETH held by first-time buyers has risen by 16% since early July, hinting at a fresh wave of retail and institutional adoption. Analysts at Glassnode called it the first meaningful trend reversal in recent ETH cycles.

An Arizona resident who wants to only be identified as Dave tells the website Moneywise.com that he received a normal-looking fraud alert from Bank of America, which questioned whether he had authorized a $399 purchase at the electronics store Best Buy. Dave responded, saying “no,” and then reportedly received a follow-up text from the scammer with a number to call. Someone claiming to be a Bank of America (BofA) representative then told Dave over the phone that his account had been compromised and that he was being targeted by a rogue BofA employee. The con artist told Dave to withdraw his whole bank account to protect it, and then the scammer instructed him to “secure” the cash using Apple Wallet. Dave was then walked through creating a scannable card on his phone that was linked to the scammer’s account. The Arizona man then deposited the cash in a bank drive-through, unwittingly transferring the money to a scammer. “This is my life savings, and I don’t have any assurances, but they sounded so real.” Peoria Police Department Detective Michael Finney worked with Dave and froze the linked accounts, managing to recover roughly 90% of his funds in five months.

2025-07-29 17:00:01+00:00,Bitcoin Demand Drops Among US Investors—Is a Price Correction Coming?,"Bitcoin (BTC) is experiencing a period of stability after its recent upward climb, currently trading around $118,502, marking a slight daily decline of about 0.3%. Despite approaching the notable resistance level at $120,000, the leading cryptocurrency has shown little indication of breaking through decisively. This quiet trading environment has drawn the attention of analysts, prompting a detailed examination of the current market sentiment and investor behavior patterns. A recent report by Arab Chain, an analyst at CryptoQuant, suggests there is waning interest among US investors at Bitcoin’s current price level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Remains Flat—And The SSR Ratio Might Explain Why Declining Demand from US Investors Utilizing the Coinbase Premium Index, a measure that compares Bitcoin’s price on Coinbase against other exchanges, Arab Chain highlights a clear downward trend in demand from American investors as prices have risen above the $105,000 mark. Arab Chain notes that although the Coinbase Premium Index remains slightly positive, indicating a minimal premium on Bitcoin in US markets, the significant reduction in this premium suggests declining enthusiasm at current price levels. Historically, strong buying interest from US investors has typically occurred when Bitcoin was priced under $105,000, suggesting that current valuations may be too elevated for many investors seeking favorable entry points. The analyst specifically noted: The index shows a significant decline in U.S. investor demand for Bitcoin. However, it remains in positive territory, indicating U.S. investors are not as active in purchasing Bitcoin at current prices compared to when it traded below $105,000. The trend suggests many potential buyers might be holding off, anticipating better opportunities should prices dip again. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Begin Profit-Taking Adding further context, another CryptoQuant analyst, Burak Kesmeci, identified emerging patterns among long-term Bitcoin holders at the key psychological resistance level of $120,000. According to Kesmeci, long-term holders have recently transitioned into net-negative territory, signaling initial phases of profit-taking. Such moves typically indicate that veteran investors, many of whom may have held Bitcoin through previous market cycles, are beginning to liquidate portions of their holdings to capitalize on recent gains.

Such sizeable institutional activity indicates this is more than typical retail profit-taking.

2025-07-29 17:00:12+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Fall: Shocking Drop Below $117,000 Rocks the Market","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Fall: Shocking Drop Below $117,000 Rocks the Market The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic and often unpredictable movements, has once again captured headlines with a significant shift. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has experienced a notable Bitcoin price fall , dipping below the crucial $117,000 mark. As reported, BTC is currently trading at $116,992.72 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden decline has sent ripples through the digital asset ecosystem, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to assess the implications. What exactly triggered this recent downturn, and what does it mean for the future of your crypto portfolio? What Triggered the Recent Bitcoin Price Fall Below $117,000? The immediate reaction to a Bitcoin price fall is often to pinpoint a single cause, but market movements are typically influenced by a confluence of factors. While the precise catalyst for this specific dip below $117,000 is still being analyzed, several common elements often contribute to such significant price adjustments in the volatile crypto landscape: Profit-Taking: After periods of upward momentum, it’s common for long-term holders and short-term traders to sell off a portion of their assets to realize gains. A large volume of such sales can exert downward pressure on the price. Macroeconomic Indicators: Global economic news, such as inflation reports, interest rate changes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. A shift towards risk-off assets could see funds flowing out of crypto. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can create fear and uncertainty (FUD), leading to sell-offs. Governments around the world are continuously evaluating how to regulate digital assets, and any new development can cause market jitters. Whale Movements: Large transactions by ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin – can significantly impact market liquidity and price. A sudden large sell order from a whale can trigger a cascade effect. Technical Resistance: Price levels often act as psychological or technical barriers. If Bitcoin struggles to break above a certain resistance level, it might experience a pullback as traders anticipate a reversal. The fact that Bitcoin touched $116,992.72 on the Binance USDT market highlights the real-time nature of these fluctuations and the global interconnectedness of crypto exchanges. Historical Context: Understanding Bitcoin Price Volatility For those new to the cryptocurrency space, a sharp Bitcoin price fall can be alarming. However, seasoned crypto enthusiasts understand that volatility is not a new phenomenon for Bitcoin. Since its inception, Bitcoin has been characterized by dramatic price swings, often referred to as ‘corrections’ or ‘dips’. Consider Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital experiment to a globally recognized asset. It has weathered numerous significant downturns: The 2017-2018 bear market saw Bitcoin drop from nearly $20,000 to around $3,000. The ‘Black Thursday’ crash in March 2020 saw a rapid decline during the onset of the global pandemic. The May 2021 correction witnessed a substantial dip from its then-all-time highs. Each of these periods of significant Bitcoin price fall was followed by a recovery, often reaching new all-time highs. This historical resilience is a key factor many long-term investors consider. The inherent volatility stems from Bitcoin’s relatively young market, its limited supply, and its demand-driven price discovery mechanism, which is often influenced by speculation and market sentiment. How Does This Bitcoin Price Fall Impact Your Crypto Portfolio? The immediate impact of a Bitcoin price fall varies significantly depending on an individual’s investment strategy, risk tolerance, and the composition of their portfolio.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Fall: Shocking Drop Below $117,000 Rocks the Market The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic and often unpredictable movements, has once again captured headlines with a significant shift. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), has experienced a notable Bitcoin price fall , dipping below the crucial $117,000 mark. As reported, BTC is currently trading at $116,992.72 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden decline has sent ripples through the digital asset ecosystem, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to assess the implications. What exactly triggered this recent downturn, and what does it mean for the future of your crypto portfolio? What Triggered the Recent Bitcoin Price Fall Below $117,000? The immediate reaction to a Bitcoin price fall is often to pinpoint a single cause, but market movements are typically influenced by a confluence of factors. While the precise catalyst for this specific dip below $117,000 is still being analyzed, several common elements often contribute to such significant price adjustments in the volatile crypto landscape: Profit-Taking: After periods of upward momentum, it’s common for long-term holders and short-term traders to sell off a portion of their assets to realize gains. A large volume of such sales can exert downward pressure on the price. Macroeconomic Indicators: Global economic news, such as inflation reports, interest rate changes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, can influence investor sentiment across all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. A shift towards risk-off assets could see funds flowing out of crypto. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can create fear and uncertainty (FUD), leading to sell-offs. Governments around the world are continuously evaluating how to regulate digital assets, and any new development can cause market jitters. Whale Movements: Large transactions by ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin – can significantly impact market liquidity and price. A sudden large sell order from a whale can trigger a cascade effect. Technical Resistance: Price levels often act as psychological or technical barriers. If Bitcoin struggles to break above a certain resistance level, it might experience a pullback as traders anticipate a reversal. The fact that Bitcoin touched $116,992.72 on the Binance USDT market highlights the real-time nature of these fluctuations and the global interconnectedness of crypto exchanges. Historical Context: Understanding Bitcoin Price Volatility For those new to the cryptocurrency space, a sharp Bitcoin price fall can be alarming. However, seasoned crypto enthusiasts understand that volatility is not a new phenomenon for Bitcoin. Since its inception, Bitcoin has been characterized by dramatic price swings, often referred to as ‘corrections’ or ‘dips’. Consider Bitcoin’s journey from a niche digital experiment to a globally recognized asset. It has weathered numerous significant downturns: The 2017-2018 bear market saw Bitcoin drop from nearly $20,000 to around $3,000. The ‘Black Thursday’ crash in March 2020 saw a rapid decline during the onset of the global pandemic. The May 2021 correction witnessed a substantial dip from its then-all-time highs. Each of these periods of significant Bitcoin price fall was followed by a recovery, often reaching new all-time highs. This historical resilience is a key factor many long-term investors consider. The inherent volatility stems from Bitcoin’s relatively young market, its limited supply, and its demand-driven price discovery mechanism, which is often influenced by speculation and market sentiment. How Does This Bitcoin Price Fall Impact Your Crypto Portfolio? The immediate impact of a Bitcoin price fall varies significantly depending on an individual’s investment strategy, risk tolerance, and the composition of their portfolio. It’s a moment that can evoke a range of emotions, from panic to opportunity. For New Investors: Those who recently entered the market at higher price points might experience fear and regret. It’s crucial for new investors to understand that short-term fluctuations are normal and to avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotion. For Short-Term Traders: Day traders and swing traders might see this as an opportunity for quick gains through short-selling or buying the dip. However, it also presents increased risk due to heightened volatility. For Long-Term Holders (HODLers): Many long-term investors view a Bitcoin price fall as a ‘discount’ or a chance to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower price. Their strategy is based on Bitcoin’s long-term potential, rather than short-term price movements.

2025-07-29 17:10:10+00:00,OpenAI’s Revolutionary ChatGPT Study Mode Transforms Education,"BitcoinWorld OpenAI’s Revolutionary ChatGPT Study Mode Transforms Education In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where innovation consistently reshapes industries, OpenAI has once again made waves. For those tracking the convergence of technology and everyday life, the latest announcement from OpenAI is particularly noteworthy: the launch of ChatGPT Study Mode . This isn’t just another feature; it’s a strategic move to fundamentally alter how students interact with AI, aiming to cultivate deeper understanding rather than simply providing instant answers. As AI continues to integrate into our digital lives, understanding its educational applications becomes crucial, much like grasping the nuances of blockchain and digital assets. What is the Purpose of ChatGPT Study Mode ? OpenAI announced the rollout of Study Mode, a new functionality within ChatGPT designed with a singular, crucial objective: to help students develop their own critical thinking skills . This initiative directly addresses a significant concern that has emerged with the widespread use of generative AI in academic settings. Instead of merely offering direct answers, Study Mode prompts users with questions, testing their comprehension, and in some instances, will deliberately withhold immediate solutions until students demonstrate engagement with the material. The core idea is to transform ChatGPT from a passive answer engine into an active learning partner. Imagine a digital tutor that doesn’t just give you the fish, but teaches you how to fish. This approach encourages students to: Engage Actively: Users are prompted to explain concepts or solve problems, ensuring they process information rather than just consuming it. Test Understanding: ChatGPT asks follow-up questions, identifying gaps in knowledge and encouraging self-correction. Promote Deeper Learning: By requiring interaction and justification, the mode aims to embed information more effectively, fostering genuine comprehension. This feature is now available to logged-in users across ChatGPT’s Free, Plus, Pro, and Team plans. OpenAI also plans to extend Study Mode to its Edu users, typically younger individuals whose schools have purchased institutional plans, in the coming weeks. This widespread rollout signifies OpenAI’s commitment to making this learning tool accessible across various educational tiers. The Evolution of AI in Education : From Fear to Facilitation When ChatGPT first emerged in 2022, its rapid adoption in schools sparked considerable debate and, in many cases, outright fear among educators. The initial response from numerous American school districts was to implement generative AI bans, concerned about plagiarism and the potential erosion of essential academic skills. However, as 2023 progressed, a shift began. Some schools repealed their bans, and teachers nationwide started to accept that AI would inevitably become a part of students’ educational journeys. This evolving perspective is rooted in the recognition that while AI presents challenges, it also offers immense potential as a learning aid. Studies have indicated that tools like ChatGPT can serve as effective tutors, providing personalized assistance and immediate feedback. Yet, the caveat remained: the risk of harming students’ critical thinking skills if used purely as a shortcut. A research paper from June highlighted this, finding that individuals using ChatGPT for essay writing exhibited lower brain activity during the process compared to those using Google Search or no external aid. Study Mode is OpenAI’s direct response to this dilemma. It’s an acknowledgment that for AI to be truly beneficial in education, it must be designed to enhance, not diminish, core cognitive abilities. It signifies a maturation in the approach to integrating AI into learning environments, moving beyond simple content generation to intelligent interaction. How Does OpenAI ChatGPT Foster Deeper Understanding? The essence of Study Mode lies in its interactive pedagogy. Instead of a student asking, ‘What is the capital of France?’ and receiving ‘Paris,’ Study Mode might respond with, ‘That’s a great question! Before I tell you, can you tell me why knowing capital cities is important for understanding a country’s geography or history?’ Or, if a student asks for the solution to a math problem, it might prompt, ‘Show me your steps so far, and I can help you identify where you might be going wrong.’ This method forces students to: Articulate their thoughts: Requiring explanations strengthens their understanding and ability to communicate complex ideas. Problem-solve actively: Rather than receiving answers, they are guided through the process of finding solutions. Engage in metacognition: They are encouraged to think about their own thinking, a cornerstone of critical thinking. This pedagogical shift is crucial for long-term learning.

Overview of Current Crypto Market Trends Ethereum is on the cusp of breaching the $4,000 threshold, a critical psychological level for the asset, while Bitcoin continues to encounter resistance below the $120,000 mark. This fluctuating market landscape offers unique opportunities and challenges for investors and project teams alike. Ethereum''s Ascent Towards $4,000 The recent surge in Ethereum''s price sees it oscillating between the mid-$3,600s and the $4,000 mark. With a robust monthly growth of over 60%, predictions suggest that Ethereum might soon surpass the $4,100 barrier, setting the stage for further gains towards the $4,500 region.

2025-07-29 17:55:10+00:00,"Bitcoin Price: Unveiling the Astounding Surge Above $118,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price: Unveiling the Astounding Surge Above $118,000 The cryptocurrency world is once again captivated by a truly significant event as Bitcoin’s price has soared to an impressive new level. According to the latest monitoring from Bitcoin World market, the flagship digital asset has successfully risen above the $118,000 mark, trading specifically at $118,016.23 on the Binance USDT market. This momentous milestone has sent ripples of excitement and anticipation throughout the global financial landscape, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to ponder the implications of such a rapid ascent. What does this remarkable achievement signify for the broader market, and what factors are driving this powerful momentum in the Bitcoin price ? What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Ascent? The journey of Bitcoin’s price to surpass $118,000 is not merely a number on a screen; it’s a culmination of various intricate market dynamics and evolving global sentiment. While the immediate trigger might be specific trading activity on platforms like Binance, the underlying drivers are often far more complex and multifaceted. Understanding these forces is crucial for anyone looking to comprehend the current market environment. Institutional Adoption and Investment: A significant driver behind the sustained growth in Bitcoin’s price has been the increasing interest and investment from large institutional players. Major financial firms, hedge funds, and even corporations are allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate asset class. The approval and success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have provided easier, regulated avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, injecting substantial capital into the market. Halving Event Anticipation: Bitcoin operates on a predetermined supply schedule, with ‘halving’ events occurring approximately every four years. These events reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are mined, effectively cutting the new supply in half. Historically, halving events have preceded significant bull runs, as reduced supply against consistent or growing demand tends to push the Bitcoin price upwards. The anticipation of future halvings often builds bullish sentiment. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic conditions, including inflation concerns, interest rate policies, and geopolitical uncertainties, can also influence Bitcoin’s price . Many view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation or a ‘digital gold’ during times of economic instability, leading to increased demand when traditional markets face headwinds. Technological Advancements and Network Growth: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability (e.g., Lightning Network) and security, enhance its utility and appeal. A growing number of users, transactions, and addresses on the network signal increasing adoption and fundamental strength, which can positively impact the Bitcoin price . Retail Investor Enthusiasm: While institutions play a large role, the collective action of millions of retail investors cannot be underestimated. Positive news, significant price milestones, and social media buzz can trigger a wave of buying pressure from individual investors, further propelling the Bitcoin price upwards. How Does This Bitcoin Price Milestone Compare to History? For long-time observers of the crypto market, a Bitcoin price of $118,000 represents a truly extraordinary achievement, marking a significant leap from its humble beginnings. Bitcoin’s journey has been characterized by dramatic peaks and troughs, each serving as a testament to its volatile yet resilient nature. To put this current surge into perspective, it’s helpful to look back at its historical performance. In its early days, Bitcoin traded for mere cents. Its first major rally saw it reach over $1,000 in 2013, a figure that seemed astronomical at the time. The iconic bull run of 2017 propelled it close to $20,000, capturing mainstream attention. Following a significant bear market, Bitcoin’s price roared back, surpassing previous highs in late 2020 and 2021, eventually hitting an all-time high that solidified its position as a major global asset. A price point above $118,000 signifies not just recovery, but a new era of valuation, reflecting growing maturity and acceptance within the global financial system. This kind of growth demonstrates a fundamental shift in perception, moving Bitcoin from a niche digital experiment to a globally recognized store of value and transactional currency. Each time Bitcoin’s price breaks a significant psychological barrier, it tends to attract a new wave of investors, further cementing its place in the financial world.

2025-07-29 18:00:27+00:00,"Ethereum Price To $20,000? ETH Is Mirroring Bitcoin’s Move From 2021","The Ethereum price may be setting the stage for a historic breakout, as a new technical analysis suggests that ETH is closely mirroring the Bitcoin (BTC) price action from 2020 to 2021. With Ethereum currently consolidating beneath a long-term downtrend line and approaching critical resistance, a crypto analyst eyes a potential move to $20,000 if the historic pattern continues to play out. Ethereum Price Mirrors Bitcoin’s Historic 2021 Pattern According to a new analysis by crypto market expert Ted Pillows, Ethereum’s current price structure is beginning to reflect a striking resemblance to Bitcoin’s breakout phase in late 2020. The analyst’s chart shows ETH following a nearly identical pattern of accumulation, re-accumulation, and compression within a descending triangle fractal that Bitcoin displayed before its parabolic bull run in 2021. Related Reading: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Says Ethereum Will Enter Price Discovery If It Takes Out This Level At the time, Bitcoin had surged from a whopping $9,550 to roughly $64,000, marking a significant price increase of 570.37%. Just like BTC during the COVID pandemic shakeout, Pillow’s analysis shows that ETH has now emerged from a prolonged consolidation phase and is testing the downtrend resistance line that has capped its highs since the 2021 peak. If Ethereum breaks through its diagonal resistance, the analyst’s chart indicates that a vertical surge toward $29,500 may become technically viable. This would represent a significant increase of approximately 672% from the cryptocurrency’s current price of $3,820. Notably, the path to this bold target mirrors Bitcoin’s trajectory after it broke out of its long-term downtrend, triggering a rapid and exponential move. The chart also illustrates a potential breakout zone that aligns with the timing of the previous cycle’s price expansion—indicating that Ethereum could be preparing for its most powerful price rally yet. While the trajectory of Pillows’ arrow on the chart targets a possible surge toward $29,500, the top of the green shaded zone suggests Ethereum could reach a peak above $58,500. Such a bold move would mark a historic breakout, representing a surge of roughly 1,432% and placing ETH at nearly half of Bitcoin’s price of $118,940 as of writing. Analyst Sets $5,000 As ETH’s Minimum Target Due to Ethereum’s bullish run lately, a few analysts in the crypto community have forecasted a potential rally toward the $5,000 mark—a move that would set a new all-time high for the leading altcoin. However, while many consider a surge to $5,000 a major milestone, Pillows views this target as merely a baseline.

2025-07-29 18:05:07+00:00,"Bitcoin OG Sitting on 1,368x Returns Suddenly Sends Coins to Kraken After 12 Years of Dormancy: Lookonchain","A Bitcoin whale that’s been lying low since 2013 has suddenly moved coins out of its wallet, sending some BTC to crypto exchange Kraken. Citing Arkham data, blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says a “Bitcoin OG” that hasn’t done anything for 12 years recently woke up and began transferring its coins – some of them to Kraken, presumably to sell on the open market. “A Bitcoin OG transferred 343 BTC ($40.52 million) out [on Monday] after 12 years of dormancy, with 130.77 BTC ($15.45 million) deposited to Kraken. This OG received 343 BTC ($29.6K at the time) 12 years ago, when the BTC price was $86. That’s a 1,368x return!” Lookonchain recently spotted another whale moving Bitcoin worth approximately $469.8 million, after it had been dormant since January 15, 2011. Throughout that period, the price of Bitcoin has risen from approximately $0.393 to $118,561, a gain of at least 30,168,093%. The whale accumulated the Bitcoin over two days starting on January 13th of 2011. Prior to moving the large Bitcoin stash, the whale carried out a test transaction for $218. Several other “ancient” Bitcoin addresses have been seen moving their coins in the last month, potentially taking profits as BTC hits all-time highs. Despite whales appearing to flip cautious on BTC, Wall Street still appears to be hungry, as evidenced by strong flows into Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

A Bitcoin whale that’s been lying low since 2013 has suddenly moved coins out of its wallet, sending some BTC to crypto exchange Kraken. Citing Arkham data, blockchain tracking firm Lookonchain says a “Bitcoin OG” that hasn’t done anything for 12 years recently woke up and began transferring its coins – some of them to Kraken, presumably to sell on the open market. “A Bitcoin OG transferred 343 BTC ($40.52 million) out [on Monday] after 12 years of dormancy, with 130.77 BTC ($15.45 million) deposited to Kraken. This OG received 343 BTC ($29.6K at the time) 12 years ago, when the BTC price was $86. That’s a 1,368x return!” Lookonchain recently spotted another whale moving Bitcoin worth approximately $469.8 million, after it had been dormant since January 15, 2011. Throughout that period, the price of Bitcoin has risen from approximately $0.393 to $118,561, a gain of at least 30,168,093%. The whale accumulated the Bitcoin over two days starting on January 13th of 2011. Prior to moving the large Bitcoin stash, the whale carried out a test transaction for $218. Several other “ancient” Bitcoin addresses have been seen moving their coins in the last month, potentially taking profits as BTC hits all-time highs. Despite whales appearing to flip cautious on BTC, Wall Street still appears to be hungry, as evidenced by strong flows into Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

2025-07-29 18:10:10+00:00,Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer: Unpacking the $236M Move to HTX,"BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer: Unpacking the $236M Move to HTX In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, certain events capture immediate attention and spark widespread discussion. One such event recently occurred, involving a substantial Bitcoin whale . Imagine a digital leviathan, holding an immense fortune in BTC, making a move that sends ripples across the entire market. This is precisely what happened when a staggering 2,000 BTC, valued at approximately $236 million, was transferred from an unknown wallet to the HTX exchange, as reported by the vigilant blockchain tracker, Whale Alert. This isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s a fascinating glimpse into the secretive world of large crypto holders and their potential influence on market dynamics. What does such a colossal transfer signify? Let’s dive in and explore the depths of this intriguing event. What Just Happened? The Enigma of the Bitcoin Whale Transfer On a recent day, the crypto community buzzed with news of a significant on-chain movement. Whale Alert, a well-known service that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions, flagged a transfer of 2,000 BTC. This colossal sum, worth around $236 million at the time of the transaction, originated from a wallet whose owner remains unidentified and landed squarely in the coffers of HTX, one of the world’s prominent cryptocurrency exchanges. But what exactly is a Bitcoin whale ? In the crypto lexicon, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a massive amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices through their buying or selling activities. These are the big players, often moving amounts that dwarf the average retail investor’s portfolio. When a whale moves such a significant sum, it’s akin to a large ship shifting course – it commands attention and raises questions about its destination and purpose. The sheer scale of this transaction, $236 million, underscores its importance. To put it into perspective, this amount could fund numerous startups, acquire substantial real estate, or significantly impact the liquidity of an exchange. The fact that the source wallet is ‘unknown’ adds a layer of mystery, fueling speculation and analytical deep dives within the crypto community. Was it an institutional investor? An early adopter? A fund rebalancing its assets? The anonymity is part of the blockchain’s design, yet it also makes these large transfers a subject of intense scrutiny. Why Do These Bitcoin Whale Moves Matter? The movement of a Bitcoin whale isn’t just a technical blip on the blockchain; it carries significant implications for the broader crypto market. Understanding these impacts is crucial for anyone trying to navigate the volatile world of digital assets. Market Impact and Volatility: A transfer of 2,000 BTC to an exchange often suggests an intention to sell, or at least to make the assets readily available for trading. If a large portion of this BTC were to be sold on the open market, it could introduce substantial selling pressure, potentially leading to a price dip. Conversely, if the transfer is for a different purpose (like arbitrage or rebalancing), the market reaction might be minimal or even positive if it signals renewed activity. Signaling Sentiment: Whale movements are often seen as leading indicators of market sentiment. A large inflow to an exchange might be interpreted as bearish (preparing to sell), while outflows might be seen as bullish (moving to cold storage, indicating holding). However, these signals are not always straightforward and require careful interpretation. Liquidity Implications: For an exchange like HTX, receiving such a large deposit significantly boosts its liquidity for Bitcoin. This means there’s more BTC available for trading pairs, which can be beneficial for large institutional trades but also means the exchange has more assets that could potentially be dumped. Transparency vs. Anonymity: While the blockchain provides transparency in terms of transaction details (amount, addresses), the identity behind ‘unknown’ wallets remains elusive. This balance between transparency and anonymity is a core tenet of cryptocurrency but also makes tracing motives challenging. Ultimately, these movements serve as crucial data points for analysts and traders, who constantly monitor on-chain metrics to gauge market sentiment and predict potential price movements. Ignoring such large transfers would be akin to ignoring major seismic activity in a geological region. Decoding the Potential Motives Behind the HTX Transfer The most captivating aspect of any large Bitcoin whale transfer is the speculation surrounding its purpose. Why would an entity move such a significant sum from an unknown wallet to an exchange like HTX? While we can’t know for certain, several plausible scenarios come to mind: Potential Motive Explanation Market Impact Profit-Taking / Selling Pressure The whale might be looking to cash out a portion of their h",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-htx-transfer/,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Blockchain Transactions|crypto whales|HTX|Market Analysis,BTC,"Massive Bitcoin Whale Transfer: Unpacking the $236M Move to HTX.

The expansion occurred through a partnership with companies like BTG Pactual and Mercado Bitcoin, furthering FalconX’s goal to support a rapidly growing digital asset ecosystem across the Latin American region. The digital asset prime broker FalconX has officially expanded into Latin America, launching operations in Brazil as part of its global growth strategy. Over the past year, the firm has also expanded into Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, bringing traditional institutions such as banks, hedge funds, and asset managers into its client base. “We are expanding into those regions because we are seeing very strong demand from traditional institutions while also seeing great volume,” Josh Barkhordar, the head of Americas Sales at FalconX, said. “The trend is not isolated to Latin America, and we think it will continue globally because there is clearly demand that is yet to be met.” FalconX has entered Brazil The expansion into the Latin American market is a significant milestone for the U.S.-based firm, and it comes with immediate high-profile partnerships, including BTG Pactual, one of Brazil’s largest investment banks, and Mercado Bitcoin, the crypto arm of e-commerce giant MercadoLibre. These collaborations will allow local institutions to offer trading, credit, and custody services for digital assets through FalconX’s full-stack prime brokerage platform. “Latin America is one of the fastest-growing regions for crypto adoption,” Barkhordar said. “The regulatory frameworks that have been put in place in the region along with the forward-thinking institutions and real economic drivers are driving the adoption of digital assets.” Brazil leads LATAM in institutional crypto growth The Brazilian government and financial regulators have so far made moves to establish clear digital asset guidelines such as the central bank’s pilot of a digital real and the integration of crypto into financial oversight frameworks. According to a Chainalysis report, institutional crypto activity in Brazil rose 48% between the last quarter of 2023 and early 2024. This sharp increase has made the country a prime destination for global firms seeking to enter the Latin American market. FalconX was last valued at $8B following a $150M funding round in 2022, backed by investors including Tiger Global, GIC, and B Capital. “FalconX’s institutional infrastructure accelerates our ability to deliver seamless crypto solutions at the speed the market demands,” Andre Portilho, the head of Digital Assets at BTG Pactual, said. “Their deep liquidity and global execution capabilities give us a meaningful edge as we continue to lead digital asset adoption across Latin America’s evolving financial landscape.” Reinaldo Rabelo, the CEO of Mercado Bitcoin, echoed the sentiment, saying, “We admire the work already underway globally and, as a pioneering company operating in Brazil since 2013, Mercado Bitcoin values the presence of players who contribute to a more robust and institutional digital asset ecosystem.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/falconx-latam-brazil-expansion/,BTC|MARKET|BTG|ASIA|BUSINESS,News|Brazil|FalconX,BTC,"FalconX has expanded into Brazil to meet rising institutional demand for digital assets in Latin America.

2025-07-29 18:40:11+00:00,Crypto Whale Activity: Unveiling a Startling Shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Whale Activity: Unveiling a Startling Shift from Bitcoin to Ethereum Ever wondered what the giants of the cryptocurrency world are up to? Their movements, often subtle, can send ripples through the entire market. Recent on-chain data reveals a fascinating shift in crypto whale activity : a noticeable decrease in large Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, while Ethereum (ETH) whale wallets are simultaneously swelling. This intriguing trend, highlighted by Santiment, prompts us to ask: What does this mean for the future of these digital behemoths and the broader crypto landscape? What’s Behind the Shifting Tides in Crypto Whale Activity ? For those new to the crypto lexicon, “whales” are individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. Their trades, whether buying or selling, have the potential to significantly influence market prices due to the sheer volume of their assets. Traditionally, Bitcoin has been the undisputed king, attracting the largest share of whale capital. However, the latest insights from Santiment on X (formerly Twitter) paint a different picture, suggesting a strategic reallocation of wealth among these powerful holders. Over the past two weeks, the number of wallets holding more than 1,000 BTC has decreased by 1.61%. This might seem like a small percentage, but considering the immense value these wallets represent, it signifies a substantial amount of Bitcoin being moved, potentially sold, or distributed into smaller holdings. Conversely, the number of wallets holding more than 10,000 ETH has increased by a robust 8%. This stark contrast indicates a growing confidence and interest in Ethereum among the largest investors. This dynamic shift in crypto whale activity isn’t merely a statistical anomaly; it could be a harbinger of evolving market sentiments and investment strategies. Understanding the motivations behind these movements is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile world of digital assets. Decoding the Data: Bitcoin Whales vs. Ethereum Whales To truly grasp the significance of these figures, let’s break down what these specific thresholds mean and why they matter: Bitcoin Whales (Wallets with >1,000 BTC): A decrease of 1.61% in these wallets suggests a few possibilities. It could indicate profit-taking after recent price rallies, a shift in investment focus, or even a strategic distribution of large holdings into smaller chunks to avoid market manipulation accusations or to increase liquidity across various platforms. Historically, a decrease in whale holdings could precede a period of consolidation or even a downturn if these whales are selling into strength. Ethereum Whales (Wallets with >10,000 ETH): An 8% increase in these wallets is a significant uptick. This suggests strong accumulation by large holders. Reasons could range from anticipation of future network upgrades (like the upcoming Dencun upgrade), the growing utility of Ethereum in decentralized finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or simply a belief in Ethereum’s long-term growth potential as a foundational layer for the decentralized web. This comparative analysis of crypto whale activity provides a snapshot of current high-net-worth investor sentiment. While Bitcoin remains a store of value, Ethereum’s ecosystem growth appears to be attracting substantial new capital from the biggest players. Why are Bitcoin Whale Wallets Decreasing? The reduction in large Bitcoin holdings isn’t necessarily a bearish signal for BTC itself, but it does invite speculation about the underlying reasons. Several factors could contribute to this trend: Profit Taking: After significant price appreciation, some long-term Bitcoin holders might be taking profits, especially if they acquired BTC at much lower prices. This is a natural part of any investment cycle. Diversification: Whales might be diversifying their portfolios. While Bitcoin is a primary holding, smart money often seeks to spread risk and capitalize on emerging opportunities in other strong assets like Ethereum. OTC Deals and Institutional Flow: Large transactions often occur over-the-counter (OTC) to avoid impacting market prices. A decrease in visible on-chain whale wallets might sometimes reflect BTC moving into institutional custody or being used in private deals that don’t show up as typical wallet-to-wallet transfers visible to retail. Regulatory Scrutiny: As regulations tighten globally, some large holders might be consciously fragmenting their holdings across multiple wallets or platforms to reduce their perceived “whale” status and potential regulatory attention. Shift in Narrative: While Bitcoin remains digital gold, Ethereum’s narrative as the backbone of Web3, DeFi, and NFTs might be attracting capital that previously solely focused on BTC.

The inflow will raise Twenty One’s total Bitcoin holdings to over 43,500 BTC, surpassing all but two public firms globally in on-balance-sheet Bitcoin ownership. The planned reserve accumulation represents a bet not just on Bitcoin’s price, but on its long-term role as a monetary base layer for a new financial architecture. “We believe Bitcoin deserves a public company worthy of its ethos,” said Jack Mallers, CEO and co-founder of Twenty One. “We’re not here to beat the existing system, we’re here to build a new one.” Bitcoin per share, not earnings per share Unlike traditional operating companies that hold Bitcoin as a hedge or diversification strategy, Twenty One has been designed from inception as a Bitcoin-native enterprise. It will forgo conventional earnings-per-share reporting in favor of a new metric, Bitcoin Per Share (BPS). This metric allows investors to track the company’s holdings on a per-share basis and monitor the value of their equity directly in Bitcoin terms. Also, all Bitcoin held by the company will be custodied transparently on-chain, with real-time proof-of-reserves available at xxi.mempool.space . “Bitcoin represents more than just a financial asset, it’s a foundational protocol for freedom, transparency, and resilience,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “Twenty One captures that ethos in corporate form.” Twenty Capital is backed by institutional firepower Twenty One is backed by a powerful institutional roster. Tether and Bitfinex are expected to be majority stakeholders, SoftBank Group holds a significant minority stake, while the remaining equity will be distributed among PIPE investors, public shareholders of CEP, and CEP’s sponsor, Cantor Fitzgerald. The new 5,800 BTC contribution includes Tether’s recent acquisition of 1,381 BTC alongside its obligation to purchase 4,422 BTC as part of the original business combination deal. The company has also made a confidential filing of its S-4 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for the listing, where it plans to trade under the ticker symbol “XXI”. These developments position Twenty One as a strategic corporate vehicle to offer Bitcoin exposure to equity investors without the dilution risks or operational burdens of legacy businesses. While companies like Tesla and Strategy integrated Bitcoin into a larger portfolio, Twenty One is positioning itself as a pure-play Bitcoin balance sheet with institutional-grade custody, real-time reporting, and no operating cash flows outside the asset itself. The firm’s launch also comes amid a resurgence of interest in corporate crypto treasuries.

Also, all Bitcoin held by the company will be custodied transparently on-chain, with real-time proof-of-reserves available at xxi.mempool.space . “Bitcoin represents more than just a financial asset, it’s a foundational protocol for freedom, transparency, and resilience,” said Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether. “Twenty One captures that ethos in corporate form.” Twenty Capital is backed by institutional firepower Twenty One is backed by a powerful institutional roster. Tether and Bitfinex are expected to be majority stakeholders, SoftBank Group holds a significant minority stake, while the remaining equity will be distributed among PIPE investors, public shareholders of CEP, and CEP’s sponsor, Cantor Fitzgerald. The new 5,800 BTC contribution includes Tether’s recent acquisition of 1,381 BTC alongside its obligation to purchase 4,422 BTC as part of the original business combination deal. The company has also made a confidential filing of its S-4 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in preparation for the listing, where it plans to trade under the ticker symbol “XXI”. These developments position Twenty One as a strategic corporate vehicle to offer Bitcoin exposure to equity investors without the dilution risks or operational burdens of legacy businesses. While companies like Tesla and Strategy integrated Bitcoin into a larger portfolio, Twenty One is positioning itself as a pure-play Bitcoin balance sheet with institutional-grade custody, real-time reporting, and no operating cash flows outside the asset itself. The firm’s launch also comes amid a resurgence of interest in corporate crypto treasuries. According to reports, over 60 public companies globally have adopted Bitcoin or other crypto assets into their treasury or investment frameworks.

In a new announcement, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts says the six men are facing charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, bank fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Beginning in December 2022, the men allegedly stole names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and bank account numbers of customers at various banks in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. They then allegedly used the stolen customer info to create fake IDs with the victim customers’ names, but with photos of impostors they recruited to help pull off the scheme. The impostors were then allegedly driven to the banks where they presented the fake IDs and withdrew large sums from the victims’ bank accounts in the form of cashier’s checks. The cashier’s checks were then allegedly deposited in accounts controlled by the six men. The scheme also allegedly included the use of bank insiders who provided them access to victim customers’ information and disabled account notifications that would have alerted customers to the unauthorized withdrawals. The six persons charged include Selby Okai, 23, of Worcester; Yves Bissainthe, 23, of Randolph; Marvin Kimani, 24, of Lowell; Keith Wainaina, 23, of Lowell; Victor Kolawole, 25, of Brockton; and Phalentz Vernot, 24, of Waltham, who was also indicted on one count of aggravated identity theft. The charges of bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud carry a sentence of up to 30 years in prison. The charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

2025-07-29 19:00:12+00:00,Bitcoin to Ether: Unveiling the Surprising Truth About Capital Flows,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin to Ether: Unveiling the Surprising Truth About Capital Flows In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, narratives often dictate sentiment. One common belief circulating recently is that investors are selling off their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings to pivot into Ether (ETH), fueling Ethereum’s impressive price rallies. This phenomenon, often termed ‘capital rotation,’ suggests a significant shift in investment focus from one major asset to another. However, what if this widely accepted notion about Bitcoin to Ether movement isn’t entirely accurate? What if the underlying market dynamics are telling a different, more surprising story? Understanding the Bitcoin to Ether Capital Flow Debate The idea of a major capital rotation from Bitcoin to Ether has gained traction, especially as Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to flourish with advancements like DeFi, NFTs, and the highly anticipated Merge (now Shapella upgrade). Many observers have pointed to ETH’s outperformance relative to BTC at various times as evidence that investors are actively divesting from the ‘digital gold’ to embrace the ‘world computer.’ The logic seems sound on the surface: as one asset gains momentum, funds naturally flow from a less performing one. However, Carmelo Alemán, a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain analytics firm, offers a compelling counter-argument. Alemán’s analysis challenges this pervasive narrative, suggesting that the recent surge in Ether’s unit price is not primarily a result of a massive sell-off in Bitcoin to fund Ethereum purchases. This insight is crucial for investors trying to navigate the complexities of the crypto market, as it reframes our understanding of where new value is truly being generated and absorbed. The Unwavering Strength of Bitcoin’s Realized Capitalization At the heart of Alemán’s argument lies a powerful on-chain metric: Bitcoin’s realized market capitalization. Unlike traditional market capitalization, which simply multiplies the current price by the circulating supply, realized capitalization values each unit of Bitcoin at the price it last moved on-chain. This provides a more accurate reflection of the aggregate cost basis of all Bitcoins in circulation, essentially showing the total amount of capital that has flowed into Bitcoin and remains held. Alemán highlights that Bitcoin’s realized market capitalization has recently reached an all-time high, hovering around an astounding $1.018 trillion. This figure is not just a number; it’s a profound indicator. If there were a massive capital flow out of Bitcoin and into Ether, we would expect to see a noticeable decline or stagnation in Bitcoin’s realized cap. The fact that it continues to climb and reach new peaks strongly suggests that: Long-term holders are not selling: The capital that has flowed into Bitcoin is largely staying put, indicating strong conviction among investors. New capital is still entering Bitcoin: Despite the focus on Ether, fresh funds are still being allocated to BTC, pushing its realized cap higher. No significant Bitcoin to Ether rotation: The aggregate value of capital held in BTC is not diminishing to fuel ETH’s rise. This metric serves as a robust on-chain confirmation that the narrative of a significant Bitcoin to Ether capital rotation, where BTC is being sold en masse to buy ETH, simply does not hold true. So, If Not Bitcoin, What’s Fueling Ether’s Ascent? If the funds aren’t primarily flowing from Bitcoin, then where is the substantial capital driving Ether’s recent price appreciation coming from? Alemán’s conclusion is straightforward and optimistic: new capital is flowing into ETH . This distinction is vital because it implies an expansion of the overall crypto market’s total value, rather than just a reallocation of existing wealth within it. The sources of this new capital could be diverse, reflecting the growing mainstream adoption and institutional interest in the broader crypto space: Fiat Inflows: New money entering the crypto ecosystem directly from traditional financial markets, perhaps from institutional investors, venture capital firms, or even large retail investors diversifying their portfolios. Stablecoin Conversions: Significant amounts of stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) that were previously held as a hedge against volatility or for quick deployment are now being converted into ETH. Broader Altcoin Market: Capital could also be rotating from smaller altcoins or less liquid assets within the crypto market into Ethereum, which is seen as a more established and secure alternative. Increased Retail Participation: A fresh wave of retail investors entering the market, drawn by Ethereum’s innovation, its growing utility, and the buzz around its technological upgrades.

Momentum is building across major assets, and volatility is picking up as capital rotates into altcoins. Traders are closely watching for a breakout, with many expecting a decisive move in the coming days. Related Reading: TRON Sees $1B USDT Mint: Liquidity Wave Incoming? Adding to the intensity, blockchain analytics platform Arkham (ARKM) has revealed that Abraxas Capital—a London-based investment management firm known for its aggressive crypto strategies—is currently down over $100 million on its short positions. Arkham specializes in deanonymizing blockchain transactions and linking them to real-world entities, offering deep insight into the strategies and exposures of major players. With prices steadily climbing, the firm’s unrealized losses are mounting, highlighting the risks of betting against a rising market. This revelation has sparked conversation across the industry, as it not only underscores growing institutional involvement but also reveals the shifting dynamics between smart money and market momentum in this stage of the cycle. Crypto traders now watch closely to see how this unfolds. Abraxas Capital Faces Mounting Losses On $800M Crypto Shorts According to Arkham Intelligence, Abraxas Capital currently holds nearly $800 million in short positions across Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and HYPE on the Hyperliquid platform. Notably, the largest BTC and ETH shorts on Hyperliquid belong to Abraxas, with data revealing a current unrealized loss (uPnL) of approximately $106.3 million on their account. These positions reflect a high-stakes strategy that may serve as a hedge against spot holdings or other long-term crypto exposures. However, this hedge is becoming increasingly costly as market conditions remain bullish. Bitcoin continues to consolidate near all-time highs, and any breakout above the $122K–$123K range could push prices toward the $150K–$160K zone—close to Abraxas’ BTC liquidation level at $156,000. As volatility returns to the market and altcoins start gaining momentum, these leveraged short positions face growing risk. If BTC and ETH break to new highs, unrealized losses on Abraxas’ account could accelerate sharply. While some analysts still expect a market correction, especially given the failure to set new highs in recent weeks, others see the consolidation as a bullish continuation pattern.

After a sharp rally earlier in July, BTC has entered a consolidation phase, forming a sideways structure with diminishing volume—a typical sign of market indecision.

2025-07-29 19:10:11+00:00,Bitcoin Price Rise: Unveiling the Potential for an Explosive Rally,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Rise: Unveiling the Potential for an Explosive Rally The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation. For those closely watching the market, a subtle yet powerful signal has emerged that could dictate the next major move for the world’s leading digital asset. We’re talking about a phenomenon that often precedes significant market shifts: a dramatic dip in implied volatility. Could this be the definitive sign pointing towards an imminent Bitcoin price rise ? Let’s dive deep into the fascinating indicators that suggest a powerful rally might be just around the corner. Unpacking Implied Volatility: Why Its Low Levels Hint at a Bitcoin Price Rise Implied volatility, a crucial metric derived from options prices, serves as the market’s collective expectation of how much an asset’s price will fluctuate in the future. When the Bitcoin Implied Volatility Index recently plummeted to its lowest level since September 2023, it sent ripples of excitement through the analyst community. But why is this particular indicator so compelling when forecasting a potential Bitcoin price rise ? Imagine a coiled spring. When it’s compressed, it holds immense potential energy, ready to release with force. Low implied volatility in financial markets often behaves similarly. It signifies a period where market participants anticipate minimal price movement, leading to tighter trading ranges and reduced speculative activity. However, this calm often precedes a storm – or, in Bitcoin’s case, a surge. Historically, such periods of low volatility have acted as consolidation phases, allowing the market to accumulate energy before a decisive directional move. For Bitcoin, this “uncoiling” has frequently been to the upside, leading to significant rallies. Let’s look at the compelling historical evidence: The September 2023 Blueprint: The last time the Bitcoin Implied Volatility Index hit such a pronounced low was in September 2023. What transpired shortly thereafter was nothing short of remarkable. Bitcoin embarked on an impressive rally, surging by nearly 50% from its then-valuation of approximately $26,000. This direct correlation offers a powerful historical precedent for what might unfold in the coming weeks or months. The “Below 45” Trend Since Late 2022: This isn’t an isolated incident. Since late 2022, a consistent and observable pattern has emerged. Whenever the Bitcoin Implied Volatility Index has closed below the 45 mark, Bitcoin has demonstrated a strong tendency to rally. This recurring behavior suggests a reliable market dynamic where suppressed volatility acts as a precursor to upward price momentum. This consistent trend strengthens the argument for a potential Bitcoin price rise following the current low volatility environment. The current subdued volatility suggests that the market is in a state of quiet accumulation, with fewer panic sellers and more confident buyers slowly building positions. This sets the stage for a potentially explosive breakout once the pent-up energy is released. Short-Term Holders: Are They Signaling a Confident Bitcoin Price Rise? Beyond the technical charts, understanding the behavior of different investor cohorts provides invaluable insights into market sentiment and future direction. Short-term holders (STHs) – defined as entities holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days – are particularly sensitive to immediate market conditions and often represent the more speculative segment of the market. Their current actions are notably bullish for a potential Bitcoin price rise . Currently, STHs are largely choosing to hold onto their assets rather than selling them off. This “hodling” conviction among newer market entrants or those who recently acquired Bitcoin indicates a strong belief in future appreciation. If widespread fear or an anticipated downturn were prevalent, we would undoubtedly observe increased selling pressure from this group, eager to secure profits or cut losses. Their restraint suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. To gain a more quantitative understanding of STH sentiment, analysts frequently turn to the Short-Term Holder Market Value-to-Realized Value (STH MVRV) ratio. This powerful on-chain metric compares the current market value of STH holdings to the average price at which they acquired their Bitcoin. Here’s how the current data illuminates the situation: The STH MVRV ratio currently stands at 1.19. Significantly, this is below the November 2024 cycle high of 1.33. What does this numerical difference signify? A higher STH MVRV ratio (like 1.33) implies that short-term holders are sitting on substantial unrealized profits. While this can be a sign of a healthy market, it also increases the likelihood of profit-taking, which can lead to price corrections. The current ratio of 1.19, being below that peak, indicates a crucial shift: a decline in speculative risk-taking among STHs. It suggests that the market has purged some of its “hot money,” ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-rise-potential/,TRADING|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|RESEARCH,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Crypto Market|PRICE PREDICTION|STH|Volatility,BTC,"Bitcoin Price Rise: Unveiling the Potential for an Explosive Rally.

This sets the stage for a potentially explosive breakout once the pent-up energy is released. Short-Term Holders: Are They Signaling a Confident Bitcoin Price Rise? Beyond the technical charts, understanding the behavior of different investor cohorts provides invaluable insights into market sentiment and future direction. Short-term holders (STHs) – defined as entities holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days – are particularly sensitive to immediate market conditions and often represent the more speculative segment of the market. Their current actions are notably bullish for a potential Bitcoin price rise . Currently, STHs are largely choosing to hold onto their assets rather than selling them off. This “hodling” conviction among newer market entrants or those who recently acquired Bitcoin indicates a strong belief in future appreciation. If widespread fear or an anticipated downturn were prevalent, we would undoubtedly observe increased selling pressure from this group, eager to secure profits or cut losses. Their restraint suggests confidence in Bitcoin’s upward trajectory. To gain a more quantitative understanding of STH sentiment, analysts frequently turn to the Short-Term Holder Market Value-to-Realized Value (STH MVRV) ratio. This powerful on-chain metric compares the current market value of STH holdings to the average price at which they acquired their Bitcoin. Here’s how the current data illuminates the situation: The STH MVRV ratio currently stands at 1.19. Significantly, this is below the November 2024 cycle high of 1.33. What does this numerical difference signify? A higher STH MVRV ratio (like 1.33) implies that short-term holders are sitting on substantial unrealized profits. While this can be a sign of a healthy market, it also increases the likelihood of profit-taking, which can lead to price corrections. The current ratio of 1.19, being below that peak, indicates a crucial shift: a decline in speculative risk-taking among STHs. It suggests that the market has purged some of its “hot money,”"
