2025-07-28 23:49:56+00:00,Trump Media’s Bitcoin ETF in limbo as SEC extends review timeline to September,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed the approval of the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. A ruling, which had previously been anticipated in July, has been postponed until September 18, 2025, according to an official filing issued on Monday. The ETF is linked to Truth Social, the social media app closely associated with President Donald Trump, who is also an active user on the platform. Trump Media submitted their ETF application in June , positioning them to be one of the early entrants into the rapidly growing digital asset investment space. “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein,” added the SEC in the letter. The delay means investors and analysts will wait at least two months before determining whether regulators approve a Bitcoin ETF linked to a politically charged brand. The fund would let small-dollar investors of the traditional variety gain access to Bitcoin as they buy shares on regular stock exchanges, without holding the cryptocurrency itself. If approved, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would only solidify Trump’s burgeoning sway in the crypto world. It would also add a politically branded fund to a category already setting records for investor demand . Approved crypto ETFs thrive as others face delays Since the beginning of the year, the SEC has green-lighted 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs, unleashing a wave of traditional investor access to the digital currency. Together, the ETFs have pulled in over $54.8 billion , making them one of the most successful U.S. ETF launches ever. Riding the wave, the SEC also approved Ethereum ETFs, solidifying crypto’s position in the pantheon of traditional finance. But other approvals have been more sluggish. The SEC remains cautious in considering ETFs for other digital assets such as Solana, Cardano, and Dogecoin. The SEC also delayed its decision on the Grayscale Solana Trust ETF on the same day it delayed the Truth Social ETF. The justices are now likely to issue a ruling by October 10. A handful of asset managers, including VanEck, Bitwise, 21Shares, and Canary, are vying for approval of their Solana-tethered ETFs. It’s not unusual for a cryptocurrency ETF decision to be delayed. The law allows the SEC as much as 240 days to make a final decision, during which it will weigh factors, including market stability, investor protection, custody arrangements, and susceptibility to market manipulation. Trump pushes pro-crypto agenda Once a crypto skeptic, Donald Trump has recently emerged as a high-profile technology booster. In the past few months, he has consistently expressed support for the crypto industry. He has also vowed to establish the United States as the global “crypto capital” and to cut regulatory red tape for digital assets. In a bold decision, Trump also selected long-time crypto supporter Paul Atkins as Chair of the SEC. Under Atkins, the Commission has reportedly been more open to crypto innovation, but cautiousness around altcoin products and politically affiliated initiatives like the Truth Social ETF still reigns. The president’s crypto ties are expanding. His name is linked to meme coins like TRUMP and MAGA, and his family is affiliated with a decentralized finance (DeFi) project called World Liberty Financial . Since Trump took office in January, the SEC has witnessed a significant boost in interest in ETF products tied to cryptocurrencies, everything from serious institutional products down to highly speculative altcoin funds. Still, regulatory oversight remains firm. Whilst the Trump-SEC has made strides in embracing the wider crypto-sphere, investor protection remains a top priority for the Commission. In the meantime, we can call a time-out on Trump Media’s Bitcoin ETF, frozen in a broader debate over how fast the U.S. should adopt digital assets. The September decision could become a turning point for politically sponsored crypto finance or bolster the SEC’s hesitancy. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

2025-07-29 00:00:03+00:00,"Bitcoin Rejected At $120,000: Binance Whale Inflows Suggest Possible Drop To $110,000","Yesterday, Bitcoin (BTC) once again faced rejection around the $120,000 resistance level after briefly reaching a high of $119,760. At the time of writing, the top cryptocurrency is trading slightly lower at $118,900. However, a sharp increase in whale inflows to Binance threatens to trigger further downside pressure for the digital asset. Binance Whales Ramp Up Bitcoin Deposits According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor BorisVest, Bitcoin whale activity on Binance has increased significantly in recent days. In particular, the Binance Whale Inflow metric recorded a notable spike on July 25, signalling rising institutional participation in exchange deposits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flow Pulse Breaks From 2017, 2021 Patterns – What It Means For The Rally On that day alone, the 30-day cumulative inflow to Binance surged by $1.2 billion, fuelling short-term selling pressure across the market. Data from CoinGlass shows that between July 24 and July 25, roughly $141 million worth of BTC long positions were liquidated as a result. It’s worth noting that alongside this spike in whale deposits, retail investors have also been moving their holdings to exchanges. However, their participation remains relatively low in comparison, hinting that recent selling pressure is predominantly whale-driven. The following chart illustrates that while retail inflows have been trending upward for weeks, the sudden increase in whale deposits has introduced additional fragility into Bitcoin’s price structure. The surge in Binance whale inflows came just before Bitcoin was rejected at the critical $120,000 level. Following this rejection, BTC retraced to the $115,000–$116,000 range, which is now acting as short-term support. The analyst noted: This area is now acting as a short-term support zone. If it fails to hold, a move toward the $110K level becomes increasingly likely. On the other hand, if Bitcoin can bounce strongly from this region, there is still potential to retest $121K and even attempt a new all-time high. BorisVest concluded that BTC’s near-term price trajectory will be determined by how well the market absorbs whale sell-off. Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Titan of Crypto remarked that if BTC decisively breaks through the $119,900 level, then it could eye new all-time highs (ATH). What Else Does Exchange Data Suggest? Whale inflows aren’t the only factor spooking investors. BTC reserves on centralized exchanges also recently reached a one-month high, suggesting that some holders may be anticipating a temporary pullback or consolidation phase before resuming the uptrend.

2025-07-29 00:25:11+00:00,Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Market Uncertainty with Insight,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Market Uncertainty with Insight Ever wondered what drives the unpredictable tides of the cryptocurrency market? Beyond charts and technical analysis, there’s a powerful psychological undercurrent at play: human emotion. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a unique barometer, attempting to quantify these emotions and offer a glimpse into the prevailing sentiment. As of July 29, this crucial indicator, provided by Alternative, stood at 73, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, albeit down two points from the previous day. But what does this number truly tell us about the market’s mood, and how can understanding it help you make more informed decisions? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index : A Market Barometer Imagine a compass that points not to true north, but to the collective emotional state of cryptocurrency investors. That’s essentially what the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to be. Ranging from 0 to 100, it provides a spectrum: 0-24: Extreme Fear – This suggests investors are highly worried, potentially overselling their assets, leading to possible buying opportunities for the brave. 25-49: Fear – A cautious market, where uncertainty might still dominate. 50-74: Greed – Investors are becoming more confident, potentially leading to increased buying pressure and higher prices. 75-100: Extreme Greed – The market is euphoric, often signaling a potential peak as assets might be overvalued, and a correction could be imminent. The index’s current reading of 73 places it squarely in the ‘Greed’ territory. While this might sound positive, a high ‘Greed’ score can also be a cautionary signal, as historical data often shows that periods of extreme greed can precede market corrections. It highlights a fascinating paradox: when everyone is feeling good, it might be time to be wary. Unlocking the Mechanics: How the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Calculated The power of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach, combining several key market indicators to paint a comprehensive picture. It’s not just about price, but about the underlying sentiment derived from various data points. Here’s a breakdown of the six factors it considers, along with their respective weightings: Factor Weighting What it Measures Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing it to average values over 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and momentum of the market, primarily for Bitcoin, comparing it to its 30-day and 90-day averages. High buying volume suggests greed. Social Media 15% Scans various social media platforms (like Twitter) for crypto-related hashtags, measuring the number and speed of posts, and sentiment analysis for keywords. Increased discussion often correlates with higher interest and greed. Surveys 15% Polls conducted with thousands of crypto investors to gauge their sentiment. (Note: Currently paused) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Measures Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising dominance often indicates fear (investors flocking to safer Bitcoin), while falling dominance suggests greed (altcoin season). Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to cryptocurrencies on Google. Rising search interest often correlates with increased public interest and potential greed. By weighing these diverse factors, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond simple price action to capture the underlying psychological currents. Decoding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does a 73 Mean for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? A reading of 73, sitting comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests that a significant portion of the crypto market participants are feeling optimistic, confident, and perhaps even a bit euphoric. This level of greed often indicates strong buying pressure, rising prices, and a general belief that the market will continue its upward trajectory. Investors might be eager to buy, fearing they’ll miss out on further gains – a phenomenon known as FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). However, the slight dip of two points from the previous day, combined with the mention of ‘weaker sentiment’ in the original context, adds an interesting nuance. While still in ‘Greed,’ this subtle shift could suggest a minor cooling off, or perhaps a moment of reflection among some investors. It’s a reminder that even within a dominant sentiment, subtle shifts can occur. Historically, periods of prolonged ‘Extreme Greed’ have often been followed by market corrections, as assets become overbought and ripe for profit-taking. A 73 isn’t ‘Extreme Greed’ yet, but it’s certainly a level that warrants careful observation rather than outright exuberance. For savvy investors, a high ‘Greed’ score isn’t necessarily a signal to buy more; it might instead be a prompt to: Review your portfolio: Are you overexposed to volat",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-fear-greed-index-32/,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Crypto Market|Greed Index|Market Sentiment.|Volatility,BTC,"Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Market Uncertainty with Insight.

A rising dominance often indicates fear (investors flocking to safer Bitcoin), while falling dominance suggests greed (altcoin season). Google Trends 10% Analyzes search queries related to cryptocurrencies on Google. Rising search interest often correlates with increased public interest and potential greed. By weighing these diverse factors, the index aims to provide a holistic view of the market’s emotional state, moving beyond simple price action to capture the underlying psychological currents. Decoding the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does a 73 Mean for the Crypto Fear & Greed Index ? A reading of 73, sitting comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests that a significant portion of the crypto market participants are feeling optimistic, confident, and perhaps even a bit euphoric. This level of greed often indicates strong buying pressure, rising prices, and a general belief that the market will continue its upward trajectory. Investors might be eager to buy, fearing they’ll miss out on further gains – a phenomenon known as FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). However, the slight dip of two points from the previous day, combined with the mention of ‘weaker sentiment’ in the original context, adds an interesting nuance. While still in ‘Greed,’ this subtle shift could suggest a minor cooling off, or perhaps a moment of reflection among some investors. It’s a reminder that even within a dominant sentiment, subtle shifts can occur. Historically, periods of prolonged ‘Extreme Greed’ have often been followed by market corrections, as assets become overbought and ripe for profit-taking. A 73 isn’t ‘Extreme Greed’ yet, but it’s certainly a level that warrants careful observation rather than outright exuberance. For savvy investors, a high ‘Greed’ score isn’t necessarily a signal to buy more; it might instead be a prompt to: Review your portfolio: Are you overexposed to volat"

2025-07-29 00:40:11+00:00,Altcoin Season: Unveiling Crucial Insights into the Crypto Market Cycle,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Unveiling Crucial Insights into the Crypto Market Cycle Are you an avid cryptocurrency enthusiast, always trying to make sense of the market’s unpredictable swings? You’ve likely heard whispers of ‘Altcoin Season’ or ‘Bitcoin Season’ – but what do these terms truly mean for your portfolio? Understanding these crucial market cycles, particularly the current state indicated by the Altcoin Season Index , is paramount for making informed decisions in the volatile world of digital assets. Let’s dive deep into what this index signifies and how you can navigate the prevailing Bitcoin Season. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index? The cryptocurrency market operates in fascinating cycles, often driven by the performance of Bitcoin relative to other digital assets. The Altcoin Season Index, a widely recognized metric tracked by platforms like CoinMarketCap (CMC), serves as a barometer for these shifts. It helps investors gauge whether the broader market is currently favoring Bitcoin or if altcoins are stealing the spotlight. At its core, the Altcoin Season Index provides a snapshot of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) and how many of them have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This 90-day window offers a balanced view, smoothing out daily fluctuations and providing a more reliable trend indicator. How Does the Altcoin Season Index Work? The index is straightforward but powerful. Here’s a quick breakdown: Measurement Period: It analyzes the performance of the top 100 coins on CoinMarketCap over the last 90 days. Exclusions: Stablecoins (like USDT, USDC) and wrapped tokens (like WBTC) are deliberately excluded to ensure the index truly reflects the performance of independent altcoins. Outperformance Metric: The key is how many of these altcoins have gained more value than Bitcoin during the specified period. Index Range: The score ranges from 1 to 100, providing a clear numerical representation of market sentiment. Let’s clarify what different scores signify: Index Score Range Market Condition Description 75 – 100 Altcoin Season At least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This is when altcoins generally see significant gains. 26 – 74 Neutral/Mixed The market is balanced, with no clear dominance by either Bitcoin or altcoins. Performance can vary wildly among different assets. 1 – 25 Bitcoin Season 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin is typically the primary driver of market gains. Decoding the Current State: Why Are We in Bitcoin Season? As reported, the Altcoin Season Index recently registered 39. This figure, being well below the 75 threshold, clearly indicates that the market is currently in a ‘Bitcoin Season’. This means that over the last 90 days, Bitcoin has largely outperformed the majority of the top 100 altcoins. Why might this be the case? Several factors contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance: Market Uncertainty: In times of macroeconomic uncertainty or broader market downturns, investors often flock to Bitcoin as a perceived ‘safe haven’ asset within the crypto space. Its larger market capitalization and longer track record give it a sense of stability compared to more volatile altcoins. Institutional Inflows: Significant institutional interest, particularly through products like Bitcoin Spot ETFs, can channel substantial capital directly into Bitcoin, bolstering its price and dominance. Halving Cycle Influence: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoin, historically precede bull runs. Leading up to and immediately after a halving, Bitcoin often sees increased attention and capital inflow, leading to its outperformance. Dominance Cycle: The crypto market often follows a pattern where Bitcoin leads the initial rally, drawing in new capital. Once Bitcoin’s price stabilizes or consolidates at a new high, that capital (and new capital) often ‘trickles down’ into altcoins, triggering an Altcoin Season. We might be in the initial phase of this cycle. Navigating Bitcoin Season: Strategies for Astute Investors While the allure of massive altcoin gains is strong, understanding that we are in a Bitcoin Season is crucial for managing expectations and refining your investment approach. Here’s how you can strategically navigate this period: 1. Prioritize Bitcoin (BTC) Exposure During Bitcoin Season, it’s logical to have a stronger allocation to Bitcoin itself. As the market leader, BTC is likely to capture the majority of the gains. For many investors, increasing their Bitcoin holdings or simply holding onto their existing BTC can be a sound strategy. 2. Research Strong Altcoins with Solid Fundamentals Even in a Bitcoin Season, not all altcoins will perform poorly. This period can be an excellent opportunity for diligent research.

Here''s what''s making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk''s Crypto Daybook Americas. The crypto market is flashing warning signs. Institutions are stepping back as they take profit, ETF inflows are collapsing, and bitcoin (BTC) looks rangebound as it struggles to challenge $120K. Market observers say that the focus now turns to Ether (ETH) and whether it can bring capital back into the fold. After BTC''s brief touch of all-time highs , the market has entered a consolidation phase. Glassnode data shows institutional ETF inflows have dramatically cooled, plunging 80% this week to just $496 million, accompanied by a decline in ETF trading volume to $18.7 billion. Bitcoin''s spot market sentiment is also weakening, with Relative Strength Index – a measure of an asset if overbought or oversold status – retreating sharply, underscoring that the asset is moving away from overbought levels. These signals indicate a clear institutional withdrawal, raising questions about potential further downside. QCP Capital notes similar tensions in derivatives. Funding rates for perpetual futures remain above 15%, suggesting aggressive long positioning, but recent flows show large players taking profit and hedging downside. A major ETH call fly was unwound, QCP said in its note, while sizeable BTC puts were bought for protection, not the kind of activity that supports a fresh leg up. Still, QCP remains constructive. “Momentum, narrative strength, and macro tailwinds are still on our side,” it wrote in a recent update. “Hodlers and institutions will likely buy the dip, as we saw on Friday.” Enflux, however, isn’t sounding the alarm. The market maker views current conditions as a period of consolidation, not capitulation. Spot and perp markets are treading water, not bleeding out. “How institutional ETH flows evolve, and whether capital re-engages with alts, would likely guide the next leg of market structure,” the firm said in a note to CoinDesk. ETH is caught between these perspectives. If institutions return, capital could rotate back into ETH and reignite the altcoin cycle. If not, this consolidation may harden into something worse. For now, the rally has paused and the path forward hinges on Ethereum. Glassnode sees fragility. Enflux sees neutrality. QCP sees hedged optimism. But the next breakout, or breakdown, will likely be sparked by how ETH flows materialize. Market Movements BTC: Bitcoin is trading at $118K, consolidating between channel support at $114K and resistance near the all-time high of $123K, after a liquidity sweep below $116K and renewed supply from a reactivated whale wallet stalled bullish momentum, according to CoinDesk''s market insights bot. ETH: Ethereum is trading at $3,783, holding a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern targeting $4,300, but neutral funding rates near multi-year resistance suggest trader caution, even as institutional accumulation continues Gold: Gold fell to a near three-week low, with spot prices down 0.7% to $3,313.57, as a U.S.-EU trade deal boosted risk sentiment and reduced demand for safe-haven assets ahead of a busy week for earnings and the Fed.

2025-07-29 01:00:29+00:00,Mega Bullish Bitcoin Price Prediction – What to Expect in the Next 2 Years,"Bitcoin’s future has sparked fresh debate among market strategists, especially after a new forecast challenged long-held assumptions about the timing of its next peak. According to Bitcoin analyst Mark Moss, the asset’s historic four-year cycle may no longer follow its familiar script. Instead of topping out in 2025 as widely expected, Moss believes the real price surge could extend into 2027—with BTC potentially reaching $395,000 . This bold outlook is rooted in the Pi Cycle Top indicator, a tool that’s gained a loyal following for accurately signaling past Bitcoin peaks. It called the tops in 2013, 2017, and 2021. However, it’s now flashing a delayed top for the first time—raising questions about whether Bitcoin is entering a longer, more sustained bull phase. While Bitcoin prepares for what could be its biggest cycle yet, early investors are also eyeing newer opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has emerged as a high-interest candidate in today’s crypto scene. Institutional Demand Hints at a Delayed Supercycle What’s also different this time is the behavior of institutional players. Public companies and large funds are buying Bitcoin aggressively, often using leverage, suggesting growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term upside. This accumulation has become a core bullish signal for many observers. That kind of early institutional activity has previously fueled major rallies. And it’s during these pre-peak periods that smart investors often position themselves—not just in Bitcoin but in promising new assets gaining early traction. This Altcoin Just Set a New Presale Record One such project catching attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Its most recent presale round sold out at record speed, a clear signal of surging demand . Backed by a growing community and a roadmap focused on long-term value , the project is now being tracked by strategists calling for a potential 47x upside . Investors looking for high-risk , high-reward plays are now treating MAGACOIN FINANCE like the early days of top cryptocurrencies like DOGE – but with a more utility-driven foundation. XRP Holders Exit as BTC Accumulators Take Charge Moss also drew attention to a curious market contrast: While institutional investors load up on Bitcoin, some high-profile XRP holders—founders included—are quietly reducing their exposure. This divergence has raised concerns about XRP’s long-term narrative, especially as Bitcoin continues to dominate attention and inflows. At the heart of the discussion is whether the crypto market is transitioning into a new phase—one that favors patient accumulation and long-term conviction over short-term gains. If so, Bitcoin’s journey to $395,000 may be slower, but possibly far more explosive than the previous cycles suggested. Conclusion Bitcoin’s extended cycle projection has reignited bullish sentiment, with new highs now expected closer to 2027. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s record-setting presale and projected 47x returns have made it one of the most closely watched altcoins this quarter—cementing its spot on the radar of forward-looking investors.

2025-07-29 02:00:48+00:00,Bitcoin Remains Flat—And The SSR Ratio Might Explain Why,"The Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) points at thinning liquidity in the sector, potentially explaining the consolidation in the asset’s price. Bitcoin SSR Rose Alongside The Earlier Price Surge As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin SSR has witnessed an increase recently. The “SSR” here refers to an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and that of the stablecoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Sets New Record As Price Plunges To $115,000 Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that peg themselves to the price of a fiat currency, with USD-based tokens being the most popular. Investors generally use stables when they want to escape the volatility associated with other digital assets like Bitcoin. Many holders who keep their capital stashed away in stablecoins, however, eventually plan to re-invest into volatile coins. As such, some view the supply of these cryptocurrencies as a measure of the ‘dry powder‘ available in the sector for BTC and other assets. Since the SSR compares the market cap of Bitcoin against this dry powder, it tells us about which part of the sector investor capital is dominating right now. When the metric goes up, it means that capital is transferring from stablecoins to BTC or if both are receiving inflows, that the latter is just seeing more of them. In either case, relative dry powder is going down. Similarly, the metric registering a decline implies capital is shifting towards stables. Such a trend can be a sign that investors have more purchasing power relative to BTC’s market cap. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin SSR over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin SSR tracked the earlier BTC price surge almost 1:1, indicating that the increase in the asset’s market cap outpaced any rise in stablecoin liquidity. Since the peak in the cryptocurrency’s price, the indicator has declined a bit, but its value still remains at a significant level of 18.8. This means that the asset’s total value is currently 18.8 times the supply of the stablecoins. “This indicates a temporary saturation in the market unless we see additional stablecoins entering,” notes the quant. The recent high values in the Bitcoin SSR may at least be in part behind the consolidation that the cryptocurrency has been facing. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Metric Often Flags Turning Points—What’s It Saying Now? It now remains to be seen where the metric would go next. A drop in its value would naturally suggest stablecoins are witnessing inflows, which could potentially set up the next leg in the BTC rally.

Recently, a significant whisper from a key source has sent ripples through these markets: the U.S. Federal Reserve is not yet prepared for immediate Fed rate cuts . This revelation, coming from Nick Timiraos, a Wall Street Journal reporter often seen as an unofficial voice for the Fed, highlights growing internal divisions that could shape economic policy for months to come. Understanding the Whisperer: Who is Nick Timiraos and Why Do His Words Matter for Fed Rate Cuts ? In the intricate dance of monetary policy, certain voices carry more weight than others. Nick Timiraos is one such voice. As a prominent reporter for the Wall Street Journal covering the Federal Reserve, his insights are meticulously dissected by economists, analysts, and investors worldwide. Why? Because Timiraos has a well-established track record of accurately reporting on the Fed’s internal deliberations and upcoming policy shifts, often just before official announcements. He is widely regarded as someone with deep connections within the central bank, making his commentary on topics like Fed rate cuts akin to an early signal from the institution itself. His recent statement on X (formerly Twitter) indicating that officials are not ready to resume interest rate cuts this week, despite expectations for eventual reductions, is therefore not just another news report. It’s a critical piece of information that sets market expectations and offers a rare glimpse into the Fed’s current mindset. When Timiraos speaks, the market listens, especially concerning something as impactful as the trajectory of interest rates. Why the Fed Isn’t Ready for Immediate Fed Rate Cuts ? For months, the Federal Reserve maintained a unified front, pausing interest rate hikes amidst concerns over inflation, particularly that driven by tariffs. The collective decision was to hold rates steady, allowing previous increases to work their way through the economy. However, the economic landscape is always evolving, and what was once a unified stance has begun to fracture. The primary reasons for the Fed’s current reluctance to initiate immediate Fed rate cuts , as per Timiraos’s report, stem from a nuanced assessment of current economic data: Inflation Appears Milder: While inflation has indeed cooled from its peaks, it hasn’t consistently hit the Fed’s 2% target. Some officials might prefer more definitive proof of sustained disinflation before easing monetary policy. Signs of Labor Market Softening: The labor market, while still robust, is showing early signs of cooling. This could be interpreted in two ways: as a sign that previous rate hikes are working effectively without causing a recession, or as a signal that the economy is weakening too rapidly, necessitating cuts. The division lies in how these signs are weighed. Desire for More Data: The Fed operates on a data-dependent framework. Even with positive trends, policymakers often prefer to see several more months of consistent data before making significant policy pivots like Fed rate cuts . This cautious approach aims to avoid premature actions that could reignite inflation or destabilize markets. This cautious approach means that despite some positive economic indicators, the internal consensus for an immediate pivot to cutting rates simply isn’t there yet. The Great Divide: Unpacking the Fed’s Three Camps on Interest Rate Cuts The notion of a perfectly unified Federal Reserve is often a myth. Different policymakers, with varying economic philosophies and regional perspectives, frequently hold diverse views. According to the recent report, the Fed is currently split into three distinct camps regarding the path forward for Fed rate cuts : The Patient Hawks: This group, likely comprising a significant portion, believes that while inflation is moderating, it’s still too early to declare victory. They advocate for maintaining current interest rates for a longer period, ensuring inflation is firmly on a path to 2% before considering any cuts. Their primary concern is avoiding a ‘stop-go’ policy that could lead to inflation resurgence. The Data-Dependent Centrists: This camp acknowledges the positive developments in inflation and the labor market but emphasizes the need for more conclusive data. They are open to Fed rate cuts but only when the evidence unequivocally supports such a move without risking inflation. They are the swing voters, highly influenced by incoming economic reports. The Dovish Advocates: A smaller but vocal group, these policymakers are increasingly concerned about the potential for overtightening to harm the labor market and broader economic growth.

2025-07-29 02:25:10+00:00,Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal: Unpacking Galaxy Digital’s Recent BTC Moves,"BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal: Unpacking Galaxy Digital’s Recent BTC Moves The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to significant movements, but when an entity like Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management company in the digital asset space, makes a substantial move, the market takes notice. Recently, a striking Bitcoin withdrawal of 3,782 BTC, valued at approximately $447 million, occurred within a mere 12-hour window from Galaxy Digital. This event, initially flagged by on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, has ignited discussions and speculation across the crypto community. What does such a large-scale transfer signify, and how might it impact the broader market dynamics? Let’s delve deeper into the layers of this intriguing development. What Exactly Happened with This Significant Bitcoin Withdrawal? According to Lookonchain’s observations on X (formerly Twitter), the 3,782 BTC were first withdrawn from Galaxy Digital’s wallets. What followed next is particularly noteworthy: a significant portion of these Bitcoins was subsequently deposited into various cryptocurrency exchanges. This rapid movement from an institutional wallet to exchange hot wallets often signals potential selling pressure or liquidity provision, warranting closer inspection by market participants. To put this into perspective, let’s consider the scale of this particular Bitcoin withdrawal : Amount: 3,782 BTC Approximate Fiat Value: $447 million (at the time of withdrawal) Timeframe: Within 12 hours Destination: Primarily cryptocurrency exchanges This recent activity also draws parallels with Galaxy Digital’s earlier reported OTC (Over-The-Counter) selling of a staggering 80,000 BTC. At the time, the firm clarified that this larger sale was executed on behalf of early Bitcoin holders, indicating a structured, private transaction rather than a public market dump. The question now arises: is the current 3,782 BTC Bitcoin withdrawal an extension of that previous strategy, or does it represent a new, distinct market maneuver? Is This Bitcoin Withdrawal a Cause for Concern or a Strategic Maneuver? The immediate reaction to large institutional movements of Bitcoin to exchanges often leans towards caution, as it can imply an intent to sell, thereby increasing supply on exchanges and potentially driving prices down. However, the reality is often more nuanced. Institutional players like Galaxy Digital engage in a variety of activities that necessitate moving significant amounts of crypto: Understanding Institutional Bitcoin Movements: Market Making: Institutions often act as market makers, providing liquidity on exchanges. This involves moving assets to and from exchanges to facilitate trading and profit from bid-ask spreads. OTC Deals: While the 80,000 BTC sale was OTC, subsequent smaller movements might be related to settlement, rebalancing, or hedging activities stemming from such large private transactions. Custodial Services: As a digital asset management firm, Galaxy Digital manages assets for clients. These withdrawals could be on behalf of clients rebalancing portfolios or exiting positions. Derivatives Trading: Funds might move BTC to exchanges to engage in futures, options, or other derivatives trading, requiring collateralization on exchange platforms. Strategic Accumulation/Distribution: While less likely for direct exchange deposits, sometimes institutions consolidate funds for strategic purposes, though usually, withdrawals from exchanges signal accumulation, and deposits signal distribution. Given Galaxy Digital’s history and role, it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions about impending price crashes. Their operations are sophisticated, often involving multiple layers of financial strategy that go beyond simple ‘buy’ or ‘sell’ actions. How Do Large Bitcoin Withdrawals Impact the Market? The impact of a substantial Bitcoin withdrawal , especially when followed by deposits to exchanges, is multifaceted. It affects market sentiment, liquidity, and potentially, price action. Market Sentiment and Price Dynamics: Increased Volatility: Large inflows to exchanges can signal increased selling pressure, leading to heightened volatility as traders react. Liquidity Shift: The movement of such a significant amount of BTC can alter the liquidity landscape on exchanges, potentially affecting order book depth. Psychological Effect: News of institutional movements can trigger FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) among retail investors, leading to reactive trading. However, it’s equally important to consider the broader market context. Bitcoin’s price is influenced by a multitude of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, technological developments, and overall adoption rates. While a single large institutional movement can create ripples, it rarely dictates the long-term trend unless it signals a fundamental shift in institutional conviction.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs are once again capturing headlines, demonstrating a robust resurgence in investor confidence. After a period of fluctuating flows, these investment vehicles have logged three consecutive days of positive inflows, signaling renewed enthusiasm for Bitcoin as a mainstream asset. Surging Capital: A Closer Look at Recent Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows July 28 proved to be a pivotal day for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , as they collectively witnessed an impressive $157.02 million in net inflows. This substantial figure not only highlights growing investor appetite but also extends a positive trend, marking the third consecutive trading day of net positive flows. Such a streak provides a comforting narrative for market watchers, suggesting a potential shift in sentiment towards sustained accumulation rather than profit-taking. The data, meticulously tracked and shared by prominent market analyst Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of where the capital is flowing. While the overall trend is undeniably positive, a deeper dive reveals distinct performances among the various ETF offerings. This granular view is crucial for understanding the underlying dynamics of the institutional and retail interest converging on the Bitcoin market. Who’s Leading the Charge Among Spot Bitcoin ETFs ? When dissecting the latest inflow figures, certain players clearly stood out, driving the bulk of the day’s positive momentum. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) once again asserted its dominance, attracting a staggering $147.37 million in inflows. This consistent performance from IBIT underscores its position as a preferred choice for large-scale investors, likely due to its brand reputation and efficient operational structure. Following IBIT closely was Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which secured a commendable $30.88 million in fresh capital. Fidelity’s strong market presence and established client base continue to make FBTC a significant contender in the rapidly evolving spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. Furthermore, Grayscale’s relatively new mini Bitcoin ETF (BTC) also made a notable contribution, pulling in $10.98 million. This indicates a diversification of interest, even within Grayscale’s suite of products, beyond its flagship GBTC which has historically seen significant outflows. However, the picture wasn’t uniformly positive across all offerings. Some ETFs experienced outflows, suggesting a rebalancing of portfolios or a shift in investor strategy. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw outflows of $14.76 million, while ARK Invest’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) recorded $17.45 million in redemptions. These outflows, while notable, were comfortably offset by the larger inflows into IBIT and FBTC, resulting in the strong overall net positive figure for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . For a clearer perspective, here’s a snapshot of the performance: ETF Ticker Net Inflows/Outflows (July 28) BlackRock IBIT +$147.37 million Fidelity FBTC +$30.88 million Grayscale Mini BTC +$10.98 million Bitwise BITB -$14.76 million ARK Invest ARKB -$17.45 million Other Spot Bitcoin ETFs No Change Why Are These Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows So Significant? The continuous positive flow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs carries profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Here are several key reasons why these figures are more than just numbers: Growing Institutional Adoption: The consistent inflows, especially into products like BlackRock’s IBIT, underscore increasing institutional confidence and participation in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are finding these ETFs to be a secure and regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing the underlying cryptocurrency. Enhanced Market Legitimacy: The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have lent significant legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. This regulatory stamp of approval helps alleviate concerns for traditional investors who might have previously viewed crypto as too volatile or unregulated. Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto: These ETFs act as crucial bridges, connecting the highly liquid and regulated traditional financial markets with the innovative, yet often perceived as complex, world of digital assets. They simplify access, making Bitcoin investment as straightforward as buying shares in any other publicly traded fund. Positive Market Sentiment: Sustained inflows typically correlate with positive market sentiment. When large sums of capital flow into these ETFs, it often signals bullish expectations among sophisticated investors, which can, in turn, influence broader market psychology and potentially contribute to price appreciation for Bitcoin.

This consistent performance from IBIT underscores its position as a preferred choice for large-scale investors, likely due to its brand reputation and efficient operational structure. Following IBIT closely was Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which secured a commendable $30.88 million in fresh capital. Fidelity’s strong market presence and established client base continue to make FBTC a significant contender in the rapidly evolving spot Bitcoin ETF landscape. Furthermore, Grayscale’s relatively new mini Bitcoin ETF (BTC) also made a notable contribution, pulling in $10.98 million. This indicates a diversification of interest, even within Grayscale’s suite of products, beyond its flagship GBTC which has historically seen significant outflows. However, the picture wasn’t uniformly positive across all offerings. Some ETFs experienced outflows, suggesting a rebalancing of portfolios or a shift in investor strategy. Bitwise’s Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw outflows of $14.76 million, while ARK Invest’s ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) recorded $17.45 million in redemptions. These outflows, while notable, were comfortably offset by the larger inflows into IBIT and FBTC, resulting in the strong overall net positive figure for U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs . For a clearer perspective, here’s a snapshot of the performance: ETF Ticker Net Inflows/Outflows (July 28) BlackRock IBIT +$147.37 million Fidelity FBTC +$30.88 million Grayscale Mini BTC +$10.98 million Bitwise BITB -$14.76 million ARK Invest ARKB -$17.45 million Other Spot Bitcoin ETFs No Change Why Are These Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows So Significant? The continuous positive flow into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs carries profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. Here are several key reasons why these figures are more than just numbers: Growing Institutional Adoption: The consistent inflows, especially into products like BlackRock’s IBIT, underscore increasing institutional confidence and participation in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and wealth managers are finding these ETFs to be a secure and regulated pathway to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly managing the underlying cryptocurrency. Enhanced Market Legitimacy: The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have lent significant legitimacy to Bitcoin as an asset class. This regulatory stamp of approval helps alleviate concerns for traditional investors who might have previously viewed crypto as too volatile or unregulated. Bridging Traditional Finance and Crypto: These ETFs act as crucial bridges, connecting the highly liquid and regulated traditional financial markets with the innovative, yet often perceived as complex, world of digital assets. They simplify access, making Bitcoin investment as straightforward as buying shares in any other publicly traded fund. Positive Market Sentiment: Sustained inflows typically correlate with positive market sentiment. When large sums of capital flow into these ETFs, it often signals bullish expectations among sophisticated investors, which can, in turn, influence broader market psychology and potentially contribute to price appreciation for Bitcoin.

2025-07-29 02:45:11+00:00,Booming U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows: A Remarkable 17-Day Streak,"BitcoinWorld Booming U.S. Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows: A Remarkable 17-Day Streak The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with exciting news! U.S. spot Ethereum ETF products have just marked an impressive milestone: 17 consecutive trading days of net inflows. On July 28 alone, these funds collectively drew in a substantial $65.77 million, signaling robust and sustained investor interest in Ethereum. This consistent accumulation of capital into spot Ethereum ETF s is a powerful indicator of growing institutional confidence and broader market acceptance for the second-largest cryptocurrency. What’s Fueling the Surge in Spot Ethereum ETF Inflows? The continuous stream of capital into spot Ethereum ETF s isn’t just a random occurrence; it’s a reflection of several underlying factors contributing to Ethereum’s appeal. Investors, both institutional and retail, are increasingly looking for regulated and accessible avenues to gain exposure to digital assets. Here are some key drivers behind this remarkable trend: Regulatory Clarity: The recent approvals by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot Ethereum ETFs have provided much-needed regulatory clarity. This reduces uncertainty for traditional financial institutions and opens the door for a wider range of investors who prefer regulated products over direct crypto holdings. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Growth: Beyond its status as a cryptocurrency, Ethereum powers a vast and innovative ecosystem encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and various decentralized applications (dApps). Its ongoing technological advancements, like the move to Proof-of-Stake and scaling solutions, make it an attractive long-term investment. Accessibility and Convenience: For many traditional investors, purchasing a spot Ethereum ETF through a brokerage account is far simpler and more familiar than navigating cryptocurrency exchanges, setting up digital wallets, and managing private keys. This ease of access significantly lowers the barrier to entry. Diversification Play: As Bitcoin ETFs have paved the way, investors are now looking to diversify their crypto exposure. Ethereum, with its distinct utility and market dynamics, offers a compelling option for portfolio diversification within the digital asset space. A Closer Look at the Latest Figures: Who’s Leading the Charge? The $65.77 million net inflow on July 28 highlights a dynamic landscape among the various spot Ethereum ETF providers. While the overall trend is positive, individual fund performances show interesting shifts in investor preferences and strategies. Data shared by Trader T on X provided a granular view of the day’s activity: ETF Name Ticker Net Inflow/Outflow (USD) BlackRock iShares Ethereum Trust ETHA $132,580,000 Fidelity Ethereum Fund FETH -$49,230,000 Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETHE -$17,580,000 Other ETFs Various $0 BlackRock’s ETHA clearly dominated the inflows, pulling in a staggering $132.58 million. This highlights BlackRock’s significant influence and investor trust, likely due to its established reputation in traditional finance. On the other hand, Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s ETHE experienced outflows. For Grayscale, these outflows are often attributed to investors converting their existing trust holdings into the newly approved ETF structure, which typically offers lower fees and better liquidity. Fidelity’s outflow could be due to profit-taking or portfolio rebalancing by some investors. Why is a 17-Day Inflow Streak for a Spot Ethereum ETF So Important? A consistent inflow streak, especially one lasting 17 days, is more than just a fleeting positive statistic. It carries significant weight for the entire cryptocurrency market, particularly for Ethereum. Here’s why it matters: Signals Sustained Institutional Demand: This isn’t a one-off event; it indicates a persistent appetite from institutional investors who are deploying significant capital into the Ethereum ecosystem. This long-term commitment is crucial for market stability and growth. Boosts Market Confidence: When large financial players consistently invest, it sends a strong signal to the broader market, validating Ethereum as a legitimate and investable asset class. This can encourage more retail investors to enter the space. Enhances Liquidity: Increased inflows contribute to deeper liquidity pools for the underlying asset, Ethereum. This makes it easier for large trades to occur without significant price slippage, leading to a more efficient market. Sets a Precedent: The success of spot Ethereum ETF s could pave the way for other altcoin ETFs, signaling to regulators that there is a demand for diverse, regulated crypto investment products. This could unlock significant capital for other projects in the future.

2025-07-29 02:50:11+00:00,ARK Invest’s Strategic Shift: Why Cathie Wood is Doubling Down on Bitmine Shares,"BitcoinWorld ARK Invest’s Strategic Shift: Why Cathie Wood is Doubling Down on Bitmine Shares In the fast-paced world of asset management, few firms capture attention quite like ARK Invest, led by the visionary Cathie Wood. Known for their bold bets on disruptive innovation, ARK Invest consistently makes headlines with their calculated portfolio adjustments. The latest move has sent ripples through the crypto and traditional markets alike: a substantial investment in Bitmine shares. This decision isn’t just a simple trade; it’s a strategic declaration of where ARK Invest sees future value in the evolving digital economy. What is Driving ARK Invest’s Latest Investment in Bitmine? On July 28, ARK Invest made a significant move, purchasing an additional $20.1 million in Bitmine shares (BMNR). This isn’t their first foray into Bitmine, signaling a reinforced conviction in the company’s potential. But what exactly makes Bitmine so appealing to a firm renowned for its forward-thinking investment philosophy? Bitmine is primarily involved in the foundational infrastructure of the cryptocurrency world, specifically Bitcoin mining. Unlike direct investments in cryptocurrencies or exchange platforms, Bitmine represents a bet on the underlying ‘picks and shovels’ of the digital gold rush. Here are a few reasons why ARK Invest might be bullish on BMNR: Infrastructure Play: Investing in Bitmine provides exposure to the growth of the crypto ecosystem without the direct price volatility of individual digital assets. It’s a bet on the necessity of mining operations regardless of short-term market fluctuations. Long-Term Vision: Cathie Wood and ARK Invest are known for their five-year investment horizon, focusing on companies that are poised to disrupt industries. They likely view Bitcoin mining as a critical, enduring component of the future financial landscape. Operational Leverage: As Bitcoin’s price potentially rises or mining difficulty adjusts, well-managed mining operations like Bitmine can offer significant operational leverage and profitability. Diversification within Crypto Exposure: This investment diversifies ARK Invest’s crypto exposure beyond exchanges (like Coinbase) or brokerages (like Robinhood) into the fundamental process of creating new crypto assets. This substantial purchase by ARK Invest underscores a belief that the foundational layers of the crypto economy are ripe for significant growth and offer a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Unpacking ARK Invest’s Portfolio Rebalancing: Why Sell Robinhood and Coinbase? While the Bitmine acquisition garnered attention, it’s equally important to examine the flip side of ARK Invest’s recent trading activity. Simultaneously, the firm offloaded $12.62 million worth of Robinhood shares (HOOD) and $6.9 million worth of Coinbase shares (COIN). This isn’t just random selling; it’s a calculated rebalancing act that reveals ARK Invest’s evolving strategy. The decision to divest from these prominent platforms suggests a shift in focus or a reallocation of capital to areas ARK Invest perceives as having greater growth potential or a more favorable risk-reward profile. Let’s consider the potential rationale: Profit Taking: Both Robinhood and Coinbase have seen significant price movements. ARK Invest might be taking profits to redeploy capital into new opportunities or strengthen existing high-conviction positions like Bitmine. Strategic Reallocation: While Coinbase is a major crypto exchange, its business model is different from a mining operation. ARK Invest might be de-emphasizing direct exchange exposure in favor of the underlying infrastructure. Robinhood, while offering crypto, is primarily a broader retail brokerage, and ARK might be reducing exposure to general market sentiment in favor of more focused disruptive tech. Regulatory Landscape: The regulatory environment for crypto exchanges and brokerages can be complex and unpredictable. Investing in mining operations might be seen as a comparatively more stable, albeit still evolving, segment of the crypto industry from a regulatory standpoint. To better visualize the shift, consider the distinct roles these companies play in the crypto ecosystem: Company Primary Function ARK Invest’s Recent Action Bitmine (BMNR) Bitcoin Mining & Infrastructure Acquisition ($20.1M) Coinbase (COIN) Cryptocurrency Exchange Divestment ($6.9M) Robinhood (HOOD) Retail Brokerage (incl. crypto) Divestment ($12.62M) This rebalancing by ARK Invest highlights their dynamic approach to portfolio management, constantly seeking to optimize exposure to the most promising areas of disruptive innovation.

2025-07-29 03:06:00+00:00,Billionaire Ray Dalio Backs 15% Allocation to Bitcoin and Gold Amid U.S. Debt Spiral,"Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio is calling for investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to bitcoin (BTC) or gold, citing heightened risks from the U.S.’s accelerating debt burden and long-term currency devaluation. “If you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin,” Dalio said on the Master Investor podcast Sunday. The comments mark a notable shift from his 2022 recommendation of just 1–2% in BTC, reflecting growing concern over what Dalio calls a “debt doom loop.” He pointed to a projected $12 trillion in new Treasury issuance over the next year, required to service the U.S.''s $36.7 trillion national debt.

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio is calling for investors to allocate 15% of their portfolios to bitcoin (BTC) or gold, citing heightened risks from the U.S.’s accelerating debt burden and long-term currency devaluation. “If you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin,” Dalio said on the Master Investor podcast Sunday. The comments mark a notable shift from his 2022 recommendation of just 1–2% in BTC, reflecting growing concern over what Dalio calls a “debt doom loop.” He pointed to a projected $12 trillion in new Treasury issuance over the next year, required to service the U.S.''s $36.7 trillion national debt.

2025-07-29 03:10:10+00:00,Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking 24-Hour Losses,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation: Unveiling the Shocking 24-Hour Losses The cryptocurrency market, a realm of electrifying volatility and immense potential, often delivers sharp, impactful reminders of its inherent risks. In the last 24 hours, a significant event unfolded in the world of crypto derivatives, leaving a trail of substantial liquidations across major digital assets. If you’re involved in crypto trading, or even just keenly observing the market, understanding these powerful movements, especially the mechanics and implications of crypto perpetual futures liquidation , is absolutely crucial for navigating the market’s often unpredictable currents. What Exactly is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation, and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the numbers, let’s demystify what we’re talking about. A perpetual futures contract is a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date. Unlike traditional futures, perpetuals mimic the spot market price through a mechanism called ‘funding rates’. They are incredibly popular because they offer high leverage, meaning you can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital (your ‘margin’). This brings us to liquidation . In simple terms, liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. When the market moves against a trader’s leveraged position, and their equity (initial margin plus/minus profit/loss) falls below a certain maintenance margin level, the exchange steps in to prevent the account balance from going negative. This automatic closure is the liquidation, and it means the trader loses their entire margin for that position. Why does it matter so much? For individual traders, it represents significant, often total, loss of capital on that specific trade. For the broader market, large-scale liquidations can create a domino effect, pushing prices down further as exchanges sell off assets, leading to more liquidations – a phenomenon known as a ‘liquidation cascade’. This is why monitoring crypto perpetual futures liquidation data provides critical insights into market sentiment and potential price movements. The Staggering 24-Hour Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation Breakdown The recent 24-hour period has been particularly telling, showcasing substantial losses for traders holding leveraged positions. Here’s a detailed look at the numbers: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidation Value Percentage of Long Liquidations Ethereum (ETH) $140 million 78.40% Bitcoin (BTC) $38.31 million 84.98% Solana (SOL) $27.88 million 87.72% These figures paint a vivid picture of market activity. Ethereum (ETH) saw the largest liquidation volume, an astonishing $140 million. This highlights ETH’s significant role in the DeFi ecosystem and its popularity among leveraged traders. Bitcoin (BTC), the market’s behemoth, experienced over $38 million in liquidations, while Solana (SOL), a rapidly growing ecosystem, contributed nearly $28 million to the total. What’s particularly striking across all three assets is the overwhelming percentage of ‘Long’ liquidations. Why Were So Many Long Positions Liquidated? Unpacking Market Dynamics The high percentage of long liquidations (positions betting on price increases) clearly indicates that the market experienced a significant downward price movement. Here’s why this typically happens: Market Correction or Downturn: A sudden or sustained dip in asset prices directly impacts long positions. As prices fall, the value of a long position decreases, pushing the trader’s margin balance closer to the liquidation threshold. Over-Leveraging: Many traders, fueled by optimism or the fear of missing out (FOMO), often take on excessive leverage. While leverage amplifies potential gains, it also drastically magnifies losses, making positions far more susceptible to even minor price fluctuations. Lack of Stop-Loss Orders: Without proper risk management tools like stop-loss orders, traders allow their losses to accumulate, eventually leading to the exchange forcibly closing their positions. Cascading Effects: When a large number of long positions are liquidated, it creates selling pressure on the market. This downward pressure can trigger further liquidations, creating a negative feedback loop that accelerates price declines. Unexpected News or Macro Events: Sometimes, unexpected macroeconomic data, regulatory news, or significant market events can trigger sharp price movements, catching leveraged traders off guard. The dominance of long liquidations in this 24-hour period serves as a powerful reminder of the risks associated with bullish bets in a volatile environment, especially when coupled with high leverage.

2025-07-29 03:40:35+00:00,Web 3.0 Founders Must Learn From AI Industry Success,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Discords and X threads aren’t fooling investors anymore. Web 3.0 founders must look towards AI to survive. Web 3.0 founders have to pivot. The AI (artificial intelligence) industry has demonstrated itself to be far more apt at innovating than Web 3.0, which as an industry must accept defeat in a way and reorganize. It would behoove AI founders to take a page out of the book of big AI companies, which have impacted lives and scooped up a big market share in short order – leaving crypto very much in the dust when it comes to the mindshare of crypto in the global consciousness versus AI. Web 3.0 founders must ask themselves, ‘What can we learn?’ As AI becomes more powerful, and it will do so quickly, Web 3.0 will quickly become a subservient industry, dependent upon the whims of the almighty big technology corporations in control of AI technology. Web 3.0 will likely only become lucrative and impactful by partnering with AI companies. Web 3.0’s decentralization, which has resulted in thousands of projects promising all sorts of decentralized versions of apps that already exist, has led to the general public – including investors – not understanding which projects are for real. Investors simply don’t know which projects can achieve results or are even offering a solution to a real problem. DAOs, DeFi protocols and metaverse land rushes are largely a cacophony of Discord servers, Telegram groups and X threads. For many Western investors, these business models are completely foreign. The business models of AI companies, including startups, are far more familiar. In addition, Web 3.0 has gained a bit of a reputation for being associated with hype and scams. The AI industry, on the other hand, has forged a clearer path towards deals that make a difference. AI companies aren’t shilling tokens based on future promises, writing convoluted whitepapers and posting endlessly online. They’re building groundbreaking technology from the ground up. In the AI industry, the cream has risen quickly to the top. The world knows that it is companies like xAI, OpenAI, Google and others that dominate the marketplace. Investors know that real innovation doesn’t come from a 10,000 NFT (non-fungible token) collection. BlackRock will tokenize bonds, not NFTs. Partners want to make deals with the AI behemoths building out the world-changing infrastructure, such as cloud providers, chipmakers or platforms like xAI’s Grok, which has revolutionized the way in which humanity seeks out information.

HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Discords and X threads aren’t fooling investors anymore. Web 3.0 founders must look towards AI to survive. Web 3.0 founders have to pivot. The AI (artificial intelligence) industry has demonstrated itself to be far more apt at innovating than Web 3.0, which as an industry must accept defeat in a way and reorganize. It would behoove AI founders to take a page out of the book of big AI companies, which have impacted lives and scooped up a big market share in short order – leaving crypto very much in the dust when it comes to the mindshare of crypto in the global consciousness versus AI. Web 3.0 founders must ask themselves, ‘What can we learn?’ As AI becomes more powerful, and it will do so quickly, Web 3.0 will quickly become a subservient industry, dependent upon the whims of the almighty big technology corporations in control of AI technology. Web 3.0 will likely only become lucrative and impactful by partnering with AI companies. Web 3.0’s decentralization, which has resulted in thousands of projects promising all sorts of decentralized versions of apps that already exist, has led to the general public – including investors – not understanding which projects are for real. Investors simply don’t know which projects can achieve results or are even offering a solution to a real problem. DAOs, DeFi protocols and metaverse land rushes are largely a cacophony of Discord servers, Telegram groups and X threads. For many Western investors, these business models are completely foreign. The business models of AI companies, including startups, are far more familiar. In addition, Web 3.0 has gained a bit of a reputation for being associated with hype and scams. The AI industry, on the other hand, has forged a clearer path towards deals that make a difference. AI companies aren’t shilling tokens based on future promises, writing convoluted whitepapers and posting endlessly online. They’re building groundbreaking technology from the ground up. In the AI industry, the cream has risen quickly to the top. The world knows that it is companies like xAI, OpenAI, Google and others that dominate the marketplace. Investors know that real innovation doesn’t come from a 10,000 NFT (non-fungible token) collection. BlackRock will tokenize bonds, not NFTs. Partners want to make deals with the AI behemoths building out the world-changing infrastructure, such as cloud providers, chipmakers or platforms like xAI’s Grok, which has revolutionized the way in which humanity seeks out information.

2025-07-29 03:50:26+00:00,Why is the Crypto Market Crashing Today?,"The post Why is the Crypto Market Crashing Today? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market has taken a dip today, with the global market cap falling by 1.76% to $3.88 trillion. While Bitcoin is staying close to its recent highs, many altcoins are under heavy selling pressure. Here’s a breakdown of what’s causing the sudden crash. Altcoins are taking the biggest hit. Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $3,779.85, slipping 2.53% in the last day. XRP has dropped 4% in a day, even though it remains up over 10% for the week, currently priced at $3.12. Solana (SOL) and BNB are both down over 2.4% daily. Cardano (ADA), priced at $0.7878, is down 6.17% in 24 hours and has lost 10.81% over the week. Dogecoin (DOGE) has also taken a sharp hit, down 7.64% today. Similarly, Sui (SUI) has tumbled 8.30% today. Overall, the market’s red zone performance shows investor reaction, profit-taking after recent rallies, and pressure from ongoing regulatory uncertainties. Reasons Behind The Recent Crash One of the reasons for the pullback may be the U.S. SEC’s decision to pause approval of new spot ETFs for altcoins. While Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs have been given the green light, altcoin ETFs are still in limbo. Experts and traders had expected the altcoin ETF approval to come soon, hoping it would bring in fresh money and drive prices up. But now, with no clear timeline, investors are stepping back and choosing to wait, creating panic selling in altcoin markets. Additionally, many altcoins have doubled or even tripled in value over the past few months. Now that Bitcoin is consolidating near its $120,000 resistance level, traders are moving their profits from altcoins back into Bitcoin, which is seen as a “safer” asset.

2025-07-29 04:00:10+00:00,Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Only 13% in Profit—A Calm Before the Storm?,"Bitcoin is gradually regaining its footing after a brief pause in its upward momentum. At the time of writing, the asset is trading above $118,000, reflecting a 10% increase over the past month. Despite this modest recovery, Bitcoin remains approximately 3.1% below its all-time high, which was reached earlier this month. The current market phase suggests a period of cautious recalibration, as traders assess the sustainability of the latest price movements amid fluctuating on-chain and exchange metrics. One of CryptoQuant’s QuickTake contributors, Darkfost, has drawn attention to a key trend among short-term Bitcoin holders. According to his analysis, on-chain traders, those actively buying and selling on spot markets, are only seeing 13% unrealized gains at present. This segment refers to holders of BTC aged between one and three months, who typically represent more reactive and sentiment-driven behavior. Compared to prior bull cycles, where profits reached as high as 232% in 2012 and 150% in 2021, the current cycle has shown far more restrained profitability, peaking at just 69% before slipping lower. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Signal? Analyst Links Binance Spot Volume Surges To Price Upswings Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Behavior Points to Caution Darkfost emphasized that even though Bitcoin’s price remains close to record highs, the current low profit margins held by short-term investors, whose realized purchase price averages around $104,000, may explain the lack of widespread selling. These holders may be waiting for stronger gains before taking profits. However, the analyst warned that if market conditions deteriorate further and these holders start to incur losses, their eventual capitulation could lead to a rapid sell-off. Historically, such capitulations have coincided with price corrections, but also presented entry opportunities for longer-term investors seeking favorable market conditions. In a related post, fellow CryptoQuant contributor BorisVest explored activity among large Bitcoin holders. He noted that whale inflows to Binance have risen sharply, with the 30-day cumulative inflow metric jumping by $1.2 billion in a single day on July 25. This sudden surge coincided with downward price pressure and a rejection at the $120,000 level, sending Bitcoin back toward the $115,000–$116,000 range. BorisVest highlighted that although retail investors have also been transferring coins to exchanges, their activity remains relatively modest in comparison, suggesting that large holders are playing a more dominant role in current market moves. Whale Inflows Add Pressure to Key Support Zone The imbalance between retail and whale inflows is creating a fragile support structure, according to BorisVest. The analyst pointed out that if the current support range around $115,000 fails to hold, Bitcoin could decline toward the $110,000 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyes Bounce off This Support Level In Reversal Campaign For $121,000 Conversely, a strong rebound from this area might set the stage for another push toward the $121,000 mark or even new record highs.

Its current correction has taken it down to $3.15. However, one analyst believes it’s still not a proper ‘buy-the-dip’ opportunity. If $XRP loses the $3.15 support level, a pullback to $3 becomes likely, which could present a solid buy-the-dip opportunity! pic.twitter.com/peZEkuwtEu — Ali (@ali_charts) July 28, 2025 XRP has retreated by almost 15% since it peaked at $3.65 on July 18. Although there have been a couple of bullish signs in the past few days, it has been unable to post any significant gains. Whales’ accumulation spree , in which these large market participants purchased over 130 million tokens in just 24 hours when the asset dipped last Friday, could only help XRP remain above a critical support level at $3. Now, though, Ali Martinez believes there could be another retracement and retest of that support line. This could happen if XRP loses the support level, which is currently testing at $3.15. If it goes below it, then $3 will be the next major defense line, which could present a “solid buy-the-dip opportunity.” Ripple’s native token faced some extreme selling pressure at the end of last week, which resulted in the aforementioned nosedive to just under $3. At the time, one of the company’s co-founders reportedly sold off $140 million worth of the asset. Nevertheless, XRP remains a highly reputable and popular cryptocurrency in the market, especially in Asia, as reported yesterday.

TL;DR After skyrocketing past its old all-time high at $3.4 about ten days ago, Ripple’s cross-border token has been unable to maintain above that level. Its current correction has taken it down to $3.15. However, one analyst believes it’s still not a proper ‘buy-the-dip’ opportunity. If $XRP loses the $3.15 support level, a pullback to $3 becomes likely, which could present a solid buy-the-dip opportunity! pic.twitter.com/peZEkuwtEu — Ali (@ali_charts) July 28, 2025 XRP has retreated by almost 15% since it peaked at $3.65 on July 18. Although there have been a couple of bullish signs in the past few days, it has been unable to post any significant gains. Whales’ accumulation spree , in which these large market participants purchased over 130 million tokens in just 24 hours when the asset dipped last Friday, could only help XRP remain above a critical support level at $3. Now, though, Ali Martinez believes there could be another retracement and retest of that support line. This could happen if XRP loses the support level, which is currently testing at $3.15. If it goes below it, then $3 will be the next major defense line, which could present a “solid buy-the-dip opportunity.” Ripple’s native token faced some extreme selling pressure at the end of last week, which resulted in the aforementioned nosedive to just under $3. At the time, one of the company’s co-founders reportedly sold off $140 million worth of the asset. Nevertheless, XRP remains a highly reputable and popular cryptocurrency in the market, especially in Asia, as reported yesterday. It had surpassed the likes of BTC and ETH in terms of trading volumes on South Korea’s biggest crypto exchanges by a long shot.

He argued that the initiative will help shield investors from America’s debt crisis, which has risen above $37.7 trillion.

He also maintained that the 15% allocation was his suggestion, and it was up to the investor to decide what best suited their portfolio. The hedge fund manager’s 15% proposition is a bit higher than the 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation he recommended in January 2022. At the time, he argued that gold and BTC were fit as an inflation hedge. “Gold is a much preferable diversifier to Bitcoin, as it tends to increase in price when risk aversion is high. It can be a useful insurance policy for a portfolio, but importantly held alongside shares and bonds to achieve a balance of risk and reward.” -Laith Khalaf, Head of Investment Analysis at AJ Bell. The American billionaire acknowledged that the current U.S debt problem and currency devaluation call for investors to consider other ways to diversify their portfolio. Dalio believes allocating 15% into store-of-value assets like gold and Bitcoin could help investors in such murky times. At the time of publication, U.S. Treasury data show that U.S. debt has surpassed $36.7 trillion. Dalio also believes the U.S. government will likely need to issue another $12 trillion worth of bonds over the next year to service its mounting debt. On Monday, the U.S. Treasury released a report that revealed the government could add another $1 trillion in debt in the third quarter. The projection surpassed the previous estimates of $453 billion, which were largely driven by weaker cash flows and lower reserves. The Treasury also revealed that the government could add another $590 billion in debt in Q4. The report noted that the U.S. government will continue to borrow due to its reliance on debt to fund budget expenses amid rising doubts about its future fiscal path. Dalio said that the U.S. is spending 40% more than it takes in, and that it can’t cut its spending. He also noted that the government has accumulated a debt that’s six times the amount of money it takes in, adding that its $1 trillion in interest payments is also half its budget deficit. The hedge fund manager argued that the Federal Reserve will need to print more money to service its debt. He believes that the situation for more cash could spook the markets and could involve another round of quantitative easing.

BlackRock’s IBIT led the charge with $147.36m, significantly outpacing its peers and reinforcing its lead among spot Bitcoin products. Cumulative inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs have now reached $54.98b, with assets under management climbing to $153.19b, according to data from SoSoValue . The funds saw $3.34b in trading volume that day, despite a wider market pullback that left total crypto market cap down over 5%. BlackRock’s ETHA Leads as Ether ETFs Surge in Popularity Ethereum ETFs, meanwhile, continued their remarkable streak, drawing $65.14m in net inflows on July 28, extending their run to 17 consecutive days. BlackRock’s ETHA stood out with a $131.95m inflow, lifting its net assets to $11.22b and underscoring growing institutional confidence in Ethereum-based products. On July 28, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a total net inflow of $157 million, marking the third consecutive day of net inflows. The largest inflow came from BlackRock’s ETF, IBIT, which recorded a net inflow of $147 million. Spot Ethereum ETFs registered a total net inflow of $65.14… pic.twitter.com/wBGfwLd251 — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 29, 2025 That confidence reflects more than short-term trading dynamics. Jamie Elkaleh, chief marketing officer at Bitget Wallet, pointed to broader structural changes. “Ethereum’s recent breakout—surging over 60% and outperforming Bitcoin—marks more than just short-term momentum,” he said. “The ETH/BTC ratio has not only broken above its 200-day average for the first time in over a year, but also formed a daily golden cross, a classic signal of sustained trend reversal.” Corporate Treasuries Pivot to Ethereum as Institutional Demand Grows Jeffrey Hu, head of investment research at HashKey Capital, echoed this sentiment. “The recent ETH rally has been driven by several converging factors that signal a fundamental shift in both narrative and institutional adoption,” he said. “Most importantly, geopolitical and macroeconomic FUD no longer clouds the narrative. Increasing regulatory clarity in the US is fueling a capital rotation into the altcoin market.” Hu also pointed to what may be the clearest sign of Ethereum’s rising stature, a growing wave of corporate accumulation. “Wednesday’s record $726.6m inflow day for spot ETH ETFs is a strong vote of confidence from traditional finance,” he said. “More significantly, we’ve seen a corporate treasury pivot. SharpLink Gaming overtook the Ethereum Foundation to become the largest corporate holder of ether, with 280,706 ETH worth approximately $840m.” According to Hu, this isn’t a one-off event. Top corporate treasuries have purchased at least $1.6b worth of ETH in the past month alone. “This is a market shift from the previous focus on only Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset,” he said. What’s particularly bullish, he added, is that these companies are becoming active participants, running nodes and leveraging Ethereum’s staking yield, which introduces a structural demand dynamic not previously seen. Bitcoin ETFs Stay Strong, Yet Ethereum Pulls Ahead in Inflows and Activity ETH ETFs now manage $21.5b in assets, accounting for 4.7% of Ethereum’s market cap. Daily trading volumes across Ethereum ETFs totaled $1.91b, with additional support from VanEck’s EFUT and Grayscale’s ETHE. Bitcoin ETFs remain strong as well, with IBIT holding $87.19b in assets, equivalent to 3.71 percent of Bitcoin’s market cap. Fidelity’s FBTC added $30.8m on the day, while Ark Invest’s ARKB saw outflows of $17.45m. While Bitcoin remains technically robust above $119,000, the inflow momentum has clearly tilted toward Ethereum. With growing clarity, rising staking rewards, and a surge in institutional participation, Ethereum is increasingly being positioned not just as an alternative, but as a foundational layer of the next crypto cycle.

What’s particularly bullish, he added, is that these companies are becoming active participants, running nodes and leveraging Ethereum’s staking yield, which introduces a structural demand dynamic not previously seen. Bitcoin ETFs Stay Strong, Yet Ethereum Pulls Ahead in Inflows and Activity ETH ETFs now manage $21.5b in assets, accounting for 4.7% of Ethereum’s market cap. Daily trading volumes across Ethereum ETFs totaled $1.91b, with additional support from VanEck’s EFUT and Grayscale’s ETHE. Bitcoin ETFs remain strong as well, with IBIT holding $87.19b in assets, equivalent to 3.71 percent of Bitcoin’s market cap. Fidelity’s FBTC added $30.8m on the day, while Ark Invest’s ARKB saw outflows of $17.45m. While Bitcoin remains technically robust above $119,000, the inflow momentum has clearly tilted toward Ethereum. With growing clarity, rising staking rewards, and a surge in institutional participation, Ethereum is increasingly being positioned not just as an alternative, but as a foundational layer of the next crypto cycle.

This New York Stock Exchange-listed Bitcoin mining company made a bold claim on X, suggesting that Ethereum (ETH) could hypothetically command a ‘replacement’ value of an astonishing $60,000. This figure dwarfs its current market price of approximately $3,800. What exactly does this mean for the future of Ethereum, and why are Wall Street firms eyeing such a dramatic potential? What is BitMine’s Astonishing Ethereum Valuation Claim? BitMine Immersion Technologies, primarily known for its Bitcoin mining operations, recently shared insights that have captivated the crypto community. The company revealed it commissioned several reputable research firms to estimate the hypothetical ‘replacement’ value of Ethereum within the context of Wall Street’s analytical frameworks. The consensus from these firms pointed towards an illustrative value of $60,000 per ETH. This isn’t just a casual prediction; it’s from a publicly traded entity engaging with traditional financial research. The sheer magnitude of the proposed value – over 15 times its current trading price – naturally raises questions and excitement. BitMine also highlighted a key observation: ETH treasury firms tend to consistently increase the amount of ETH held per share over time. This trend, they suggest, could enable these firms to potentially outperform the asset itself, implying a strong belief in Ethereum’s long-term growth and stability as a digital asset. Understanding the ‘Replacement Value’ Concept in Ethereum Valuation The term ‘replacement value’ is typically used in traditional finance to estimate the cost of replacing an existing asset or infrastructure with a new one of similar utility. Applying this concept to a decentralized digital asset like Ethereum, however, introduces unique complexities and interpretations. For Wall Street, estimating the Ethereum valuation based on replacement cost could involve several facets: Cost of Network Development: What would it cost to build a blockchain network from scratch offering Ethereum’s security, decentralization, and smart contract capabilities? This includes R&D, talent, and infrastructure. Utility as a Global Settlement Layer: Ethereum functions as a foundational layer for countless decentralized applications (dApps), NFTs, and DeFi protocols. Its replacement value might reflect the immense economic activity and innovation built upon its network. Competitive Advantage & Network Effects: Ethereum boasts the largest developer community and most robust ecosystem. Replacing this network effect and established trust would be incredibly expensive. Energy Efficiency Post-Merge: After its transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge), Ethereum significantly reduced its energy consumption. Its ‘replacement’ might also factor in the cost of developing a similarly sustainable, high-performance blockchain. Unlike a physical asset, Ethereum’s value isn’t just in its code but in its utility, adoption, and the collective trust placed in its decentralized infrastructure. Wall Street firms, when assessing such a value, are likely looking at it through the lens of a technology giant or a digital commodity with unparalleled utility. Why is BitMine Making This Bold Ethereum Valuation Prediction? It might seem unusual for a Bitcoin mining company to extensively research and publicize a hypothetical Ethereum valuation . However, BitMine’s move could be interpreted in several strategic ways: Diversified Market Insight: While primarily a Bitcoin miner, BitMine operates within the broader crypto ecosystem. Valuing major assets like Ethereum offers comprehensive market insight and potential future diversification. Highlighting Crypto’s Undervalued Potential: By presenting such a high hypothetical value for Ethereum, BitMine might be signaling to traditional finance that the entire crypto market, including Bitcoin, is significantly undervalued by conventional metrics. Strategic Positioning: As the crypto landscape evolves, companies like BitMine might be exploring new revenue streams beyond pure Bitcoin mining, such as Ethereum staking or supporting Ethereum-based applications. A strong belief in ETH’s value would align with such strategic shifts. Generating Discussion & Interest: A bold claim like $60,000 ETH undoubtedly generates significant media attention and discussion, drawing more eyes to the company and the broader crypto space.

2025-07-29 05:30:00+00:00,Ray Dalio Recommends Putting 15% in Bitcoin or Gold,"On the Master Investor podcast, Dalio described the allocation as offering the “best return-to-risk ratio” amid what he called a looming economic crisis. While Dalio admitted to holding a small amount of Bitcoin, he still favors gold, though he acknowledged that both assets have outperformed in recent months. Meanwhile, Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, paused Bitcoin purchases for the second time in July, holding at 607,770 BTC. Despite the pause, the company is still very much committed to its BTC strategy and recently upsized a fundraising round to $2.52 billion to support future buys. Ray Dalio Backs 15% Bitcoin, Gold Allocation American billionaire and Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio once again weighed in on the ongoing economic crisis in the United States, and urged investors to consider allocating a large portion of their portfolios—around 15%—to either Bitcoin or gold. On the Master Investor podcast , Dalio pointed out that such an allocation will offer the “best return-to-risk ratio” in the current environment, shaped by America’s soaring national debt and the ongoing devaluation of its currency. While Dalio admitted he personally holds “some Bitcoin, but not much,” he did suggest a clear preference for gold, though he left the exact split between the two assets up to individual investors. His latest suggestion is a stark shift from his earlier recommendation in January of 2022, when he advised just a 1% to 2% Bitcoin allocation. Dalio’s warning was made amid fresh concerns about the fiscal health of the US government, which is grappling with a record $36.7 trillion in national debt . He said that the Treasury is expected to issue another $12 trillion in securities over the coming year just to service this debt. Supporting his concerns, a recent US Treasury report projected $1 trillion in new borrowing for the third quarter of 2025—$453 billion more than previously estimated—due to weaker cash flows and declining reserves. Another $590 billion in borrowing is anticipated for Q4, which means that there is an intensifying reliance on debt to fund federal expenditures. Dalio also warned that other Western economies, like the United Kingdom, are facing a similar “debt doom loop,” and he argued that currencies in these regions are likely to continue underperforming against hard assets like Bitcoin and gold. Despite recognizing Bitcoin’s value as an “effective diversifier,” Dalio is still somewhat skeptical about its viability as a reserve currency. He pointed out that Bitcoin’s lack of privacy and the transparency of its blockchain make it unlikely that central banks will adopt it for official monetary use, especially considering the risk of potential vulnerabilities in its code. Still, both Bitcoin and gold have shown strong performance despite growing economic uncertainty. Bitcoin is currently trading at around $118,344, which is approximately 4% below its July 14 all-time high of $123,230. Gold also posted multiple record highs in recent months. BTC price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarletCap ) Strategy Pauses Bitcoin Buys Again One of the companies that is notorious for allocating money towards buying Bitcoin surprisingly did not purchase any over the past week. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which is the largest public holder of Bitcoin, reported no new BTC purchases last week, despite impressive market activity that saw Bitcoin’s price climb from around $118,000 to over $119,000. According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that was released Monday, the firm’s Bitcoin holdings stayed at 607,770 BTC. This was the second time in July that Strategy did not buy any Bitcoin, following a similar pause in the first week of the month. Strategy Bitcoin purchase update (Source: SEC ) The slowdown reflects an overall deceleration in Strategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. In July, the company reported only two purchases: 4,225 BTC on July 14 and 6,220 BTC on July 21, totaling 10,445 BTC. This is a 39% decline compared to the 17,075 BTC that was acquired in June. The firm’s buying pace was even more aggressive earlier in the year, with 26,695 BTC purchased in May and 25,370 BTC in April. Apart from July, the only other week Strategy skipped a Bitcoin purchase in recent months was the first week of April. The pause in buying happened alongside Strategy’s decision to expand its fundraising efforts. On Friday, the company upsized its Series A perpetual stretch preferred stock (STRC) offering from $500 million to $2.521 billion. The stock was priced at $90, with the transaction expected to settle on Tuesday, pending customary closing conditions. This new equity raise follows a similar pattern to earlier Strategy offerings, like the STRK program, and is intended to provide more capital for future Bitcoin acquisitions. Despite the buying pause, Strategy is still very committed to its aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Co-founder Michael Saylor recently posted on X referring to the S",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10231/ray-dalio-recommends-putting-15-in-bitcoin-or-gold,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|REGULATION|BTG,News|Crypto,BTC,"Ray Dalio Recommends Putting 15% in Bitcoin or Gold.

This was the second time in July that Strategy did not buy any Bitcoin, following a similar pause in the first week of the month. Strategy Bitcoin purchase update (Source: SEC ) The slowdown reflects an overall deceleration in Strategy’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy. In July, the company reported only two purchases: 4,225 BTC on July 14 and 6,220 BTC on July 21, totaling 10,445 BTC. This is a 39% decline compared to the 17,075 BTC that was acquired in June. The firm’s buying pace was even more aggressive earlier in the year, with 26,695 BTC purchased in May and 25,370 BTC in April. Apart from July, the only other week Strategy skipped a Bitcoin purchase in recent months was the first week of April. The pause in buying happened alongside Strategy’s decision to expand its fundraising efforts. On Friday, the company upsized its Series A perpetual stretch preferred stock (STRC) offering from $500 million to $2.521 billion. The stock was priced at $90, with the transaction expected to settle on Tuesday, pending customary closing conditions. This new equity raise follows a similar pattern to earlier Strategy offerings, like the STRK program, and is intended to provide more capital for future Bitcoin acquisitions. Despite the buying pause, Strategy is still very committed to its aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Co-founder Michael Saylor recently posted on X referring to the S"

2025-07-29 05:51:08+00:00,How Much More Bitcoin (BTC) Can Strategy Buy? Here Are the Latest Figures Based on Current Data,"Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy, led by Michael Saylor, made a remarkable move in the crypto markets with its share sale on July 24. The company priced 28 million shares of its new variable-rate preferred stock, called “Stretch” (STRC), at $90 per share, generating total gross proceeds of $2.52 billion. This sale was the largest initial public offering (IPO) in 2025, exceeding the initial target of $500 million. According to investment bank TD Cowen, the $2.47 billion in net proceeds from this capital raise will be largely used for new BTC purchases. Assuming an average price of $120,000 per Bitcoin, Strategy plans to add more than 20,500 BTC to its treasury. “Strategy acts as a conduit for institutional capital flows into Bitcoin by offering BTC-backed securities that appeal to different investor classes,” TD Cowen analysts Lance Vitanza and Jonnathan Navarrete wrote in a note to investors. The analysts noted that the company''s cost of capital advantage is unrivaled in the industry and that this business model has attracted many new companies. The same note also stated that the company could purchase more than 17,000 more bitcoins over the next 10 years without diluting common stock.

With over 93 million users, India now ranks as the largest crypto-owning country in the world. That makes it no surprise that Coinbase, the largest publicly listed crypto exchange in the U.S., is reportedly making a move in this market. The Claim Recent media reports suggest that Coinbase is in talks to acquire CoinDCX, one of India’s top cryptocurrency exchanges, at a valuation of under $1 billion. The timing of these alleged negotiations has raised eyebrows, as it follows closely after a $44 million hack on CoinDCX , which reportedly affected the exchange’s valuation and market reputation. CoinDCX had previously reached a $2.2 billion valuation in 2022 after a $135 million Series D funding round. But after suffering unauthorized access to its hot wallet in July 2025, its estimated worth has fallen significantly, reportedly creating a window for acquisition talks to begin. What CoinDCX Said? Despite the flurry of speculation, CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta has publicly denied the rumors. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), he stated clearly “CoinDCX is not up for sale!” Sumit Gupta on X His statement comes amid rising media coverage of the potential deal, but his tone leaves little room for doubt that CoinDCX is staying independent for now. Coinbase’s Position Coinbase has not confirmed or denied the acquisition claim. In its standard approach to speculation, the company said it does not comment on market rumors. However, Coinbase’s recent progress in India, particularly gaining registration with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), signals a serious intent to expand in the region. Its 2022 launch in India was halted amid regulatory uncertainties, but it now seems to be rebuilding that plan through more compliant and strategic steps. Coinpedia’s Fact Check Verdict As of now, there is no official confirmation from either Coinbase or CoinDCX that an acquisition is underway. While local reports and market speculation suggest interest, the only direct public statement, by CoinDCX’s CEO, flatly denies any deal is in progress. Given this clear denial and the lack of formal confirmation from Coinbase, Coinpedia finds the claim to be untrue at this time. What’s Next? India remains a key strategic market for Coinbase and other global crypto firms. With a massive user base and growing regulatory clarity , we’ll likely see more moves in the region from partnerships to infrastructure expansion. Whether that includes a future acquisition, and whether CoinDCX could still be part of those plans, remains to be seen.But for now, the Coinbase–CoinDCX deal is just a rumor. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Some analysts suggested that the cryptocurrency will have a massive run in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Builds at $117K: Cost Basis Distribution Defines Key Support Level Injective Retests Crucial Levels Over the past month, Injective has recorded a substantial bullish performance, climbing 40% since late June, when the cryptocurrency traded below the $10 support. Since hitting its December high of $35.26, INJ has retraced around 60%, falling below this key support multiple times. During the April-May market recovery, the cryptocurrency broke out of its multi-month downtrend and climbed to its $10-$15 local price range, hitting a multi-month high of $15.48. However, the June pullback sent the token’s price to the $9 support zone before it bounced, tested the $10-$12 area, and broke out of its one-month downtrend in early July. At the time, analyst Crypto Rand suggested that a breakout above the $12 resistance level would “trigger the bull reversal,” which would push the token’s price toward the local range high. Injective has been attempting to reclaim the crucial $15 range high since its early July breakout, hitting a five-month high of $16.35 on Monday and passing the $16 barrier for the first time since February. Amid the token’s momentum, Crypto Rand noted that “INJ following the path, we are going straight to $30” as the first stop.” He added that Injective has become the Layer-1 (L1) with the highest code commits over the past 365 days. A recent report showed that the network is leading with 36,500 commits, 3.2% ahead of other L1s. Is A Rally To New Highs Near? Analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that Injective could see a 66% rally if it breaks out of a triangle formation. According to the chart, the cryptocurrency has been forming an ascending triangle pattern since March, with the key resistance level sitting around the $15 area. Amid its start-of-week pump, the cryptocurrency briefly broke out of the pattern but ultimately failed to hold above the crucial resistance. Notably, INJ fell below the $15 mark after failing to reclaim this level, retracing 10% intraday. However, reclaiming the key resistance would propel Injective to $25, a level not seen since January. Meanwhile, market watcher Crypto Patel pointed out an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern forming on Injective’s chart over the past six months, which could propel the token to a new yearly high if it breaks out. He highlighted that the INJ’s rising trendline support remains intact, while the pattern’s neckline has been retested twice, with the price compressing between these two levels. To the analyst, Injective needs a daily close and hold above the $16.20 area to confirm the breakout. If it reclaims this level, the setup would target a 153% move toward $41 mark, with the post-breakout initial targets sitting around the $26.36 and $34.32 resistances.

On the contrary, he affirmed that falling below the $12 support zone would invalidate the setup, which could also send the token’s price to the next support level around the $10 mark.

2025-07-29 06:26:03+00:00,"Bitcoin Holds Steady, but ETH, XRP, and ADA Price Drop Hard","The post Bitcoin Holds Steady, but ETH, XRP, and ADA Price Drop Hard appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is down today , losing over $66 billion in value in just one day. The total market cap now sits around $3.83 trillion, down from recent highs. Bitcoin is holding steady above $118,000, but most altcoins are bleeding, and investor sentiment has turned cautious. So, what exactly caused today’s crypto pullback? Let’s break it down. Why Crypto Market is Down Today? 1. Profit-Taking After July’s Rally Many tokens saw impressive gains last month, and traders are now locking in profits. This natural pullback has triggered a wave of selling, especially in speculative altcoins, leading to sharp price drops across the board. 2. Liquidations From Leverage As prices started to dip, leveraged positions in the market began to unwind. This caused a chain reaction of forced liquidations, accelerating the decline particularly for altcoins like Solana, Cardano, Dogecoin, and meme coins like Fartcoin (which dropped 15%). 3. Uncertainty Around the FED and Global Trade Traders are nervous ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting , unsure of whether rate cuts or hawkish moves are coming. On top of that, a new U.S.–EU trade deal, though reducing tariffs to 15%, created fresh uncertainty that spilled into crypto markets. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Bull Run Faces Reality Check as 10x Research Warns of Market Slowdown , 4. Old Bitcoin Wallets Are Moving Coins Whale activity added to the tension. Some older Bitcoin wallets moved large amounts of BTC, which often signals a shift in long-term holder behavior. Although Metaplanet bought 780 BTC above $118K, the market hasn’t shown a confident recovery yet. 5. SEC Delays Crypto ETF Decisions Again The U.S. SEC has once again postponed decisions on key Bitcoin and Solana ETFs, pushing deadlines into September and October. For many investors hoping for institutional adoption, this delay was disappointing, and it’s showing in the market. What’s Next For the Crypto Market? Today’s crypto dip isn’t driven by panic but by profit-taking, regulatory delays, macroeconomic uncertainty, and whale movements. Bitcoin remains above key support, but the altcoin market is feeling the pressure. Until confidence returns, possibly through a Fed announcement or ETF approval, investors should expect continued caution and volatility. For now, the rally has hit the pause button. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Speaking on The Master Investor podcast, Dalio claimed that investors should allocate at least 15% of their portfolios to gold and Bitcoin. According to Dalio, rising public debt, particularly in the US and other major economies, has not yet been fully priced into the markets. He stated that this situation could lead to a major crash in bond and stock markets in the coming period. Dalio stated that the US government is spending 40% more than its revenue and that this deficit is unsustainable, saying, “The government has accumulated debt six times its revenue, and annual interest payments are reaching $1 trillion. This equates to half of the budget deficit.” Related News: List of Altcoins Most Searched for in Recent Hours Revealed - Ethereum in Fifth Place, Top Four Are a Big Surprise Dalio pointed out that these debts can only be financed through new borrowing and the Fed''s money printing. He argued that this could erode investor confidence and that developments such as a new wave of quantitative easing or the government tightening its grip on the Fed could cause sharp market declines. Dalio stated that such signals are “slowly starting to blink.” Dalio stated that gold and Bitcoin could be considered “hedges” against these uncertainties. However, he made it clear that he prioritizes gold over the other two assets. He argued that BTC lacks privacy and is unlikely to be adopted as a reserve currency by central banks. “There are doubts about whether Bitcoin’s protocol can be changed or its code can be cracked,” Dalio said, adding that he holds “some Bitcoin” in his portfolio, but it is below the actual weight. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-29 06:40:11+00:00,Bitcoin Withdrawal: Unprecedented $415M Transfer Signals Major HODL Intent,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Withdrawal: Unprecedented $415M Transfer Signals Major HODL Intent The world of cryptocurrency is always abuzz with activity, but every now and then, a development emerges that truly captures attention. Such is the case with a recent, staggering Bitcoin withdrawal that saw hundreds of millions of dollars in BTC move from a major exchange to a brand-new wallet address. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a move that sparks immediate questions and speculation among market observers and enthusiasts alike. What does such a colossal transfer signify, and why is it drawing so much interest? What Just Happened? Decoding the Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal In a move that sent ripples through the on-chain analytics community, a newly created wallet address, identifiable by its starting sequence ‘3KPAqE’, became the recipient of a truly monumental sum of Bitcoin. Over the past three days, this fresh address absorbed a staggering 3,500 BTC, an amount valued at approximately $415.67 million. The source of this immense influx? None other than the prominent crypto exchange, Gemini. This significant Bitcoin withdrawal was first highlighted by Onchain Lens, a reputable on-chain analytics platform, on X (formerly Twitter). Their tracking revealed the consistent flow of funds from Gemini’s coffers directly into this virgin wallet. Such large-scale movements from exchanges are often interpreted as a strong indicator of intent to hold assets for the long term, rather than for immediate trading or selling. It suggests a strategic accumulation, potentially by a high-net-worth individual or an institutional entity looking to secure their assets off-exchange. To put the scale of this Bitcoin withdrawal into perspective, consider the following details: Metric Details Amount Transferred 3,500 BTC (approximately $415.67 million) Source Exchange Gemini Destination Wallet Newly created address starting with 3KPAqE Timeframe Over three days Source of Information Onchain Lens (on X) Why Does a Bitcoin Withdrawal of This Scale Matter? A Bitcoin withdrawal of this magnitude is far from trivial. It holds significant implications for the broader cryptocurrency market, influencing everything from market sentiment to potential price action. When large amounts of Bitcoin are moved off exchanges, it generally signals a reduction in the immediate selling pressure on the market. Exchanges are typically where assets are held for active trading or for liquidation. Therefore, moving them into a private, newly created wallet often implies that the owner intends to hold these assets for an extended period, effectively removing them from the circulating supply available for trade. This phenomenon is particularly noteworthy because it can contribute to a ‘supply shock’ over time, where demand outstrips the readily available supply on exchanges. Such a scenario can be a precursor to upward price movements, assuming sustained demand. Furthermore, the identity of the recipient, while unknown, is crucial. If this represents an institutional player or a major whale, it indicates strong conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, potentially encouraging other large investors to follow suit. Conversely, if these were assets being prepared for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, it still suggests a large buyer is absorbing supply without directly impacting exchange order books. On-Chain Analytics: Peeking Behind the Bitcoin Withdrawal Curtain The ability to track such a massive Bitcoin withdrawal is a testament to the power and transparency of on-chain analytics. Unlike traditional financial systems where large transactions can remain opaque, blockchain technology allows for every transaction to be publicly verifiable. On-chain analytics platforms like Onchain Lens leverage this data to provide invaluable insights into market trends, whale movements, and investor behavior. Here’s why on-chain data is critical: Transparency: Every transaction, wallet address, and block is recorded on the public ledger, making it auditable. Market Insights: Analysts can track exchange inflows and outflows, identifying periods of accumulation or distribution. A significant Bitcoin withdrawal , for instance, points to accumulation. Whale Tracking: Large holders (whales) often move significant amounts of crypto. Monitoring these movements can give an early indication of their market intentions. Supply Dynamics: By observing the amount of Bitcoin held on exchanges versus in private wallets, analysts can gauge the potential selling pressure or HODL sentiment in the market. The precision with which Onchain Lens identified the source (Gemini) and destination (the new 3KPAqE wallet) underscores how sophisticated these tools have become.

The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement! In a move that has captivated investors and analysts alike, Bitcoin (BTC) has emphatically surged past the significant $119,000 mark . According to real-time market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at an impressive $119,019.83 on the Binance USDT market. This latest Bitcoin price surge isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful wave of momentum that has many wondering: what’s fueling this incredible ascent, and what does it mean for the future of digital assets? Let’s dive deep into the forces driving this monumental rally and explore what could be next for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Igniting This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the catalysts behind Bitcoin’s recent rally requires a look at several interconnected factors. This isn’t a singular event but rather the culmination of various macroeconomic trends, technological advancements, and shifting investor sentiment. Here are some key drivers: Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows: A major driver of the current Bitcoin price surge is the increasing interest and investment from institutional players. The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. These ETFs have seen substantial inflows, signaling a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and even corporate treasuries are now allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, providing significant buying pressure. The Bitcoin Halving Event: Historically, Bitcoin’s price has seen significant upward movement following its quadrennial halving events. The most recent halving, which occurred earlier this year, reduced the reward for mining new blocks by half, thereby decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. This supply shock, combined with steady or increasing demand, naturally creates upward pressure on the price. It’s a classic economic principle of scarcity at play. Learn more about the impact of Bitcoin halvings. Macroeconomic Landscape and Inflation Concerns: In an era of persistent inflation and geopolitical uncertainties, many investors are seeking alternative assets to preserve wealth. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” is increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation and a safe haven asset. As central banks continue to navigate complex economic conditions, the appeal of a decentralized, finite asset like Bitcoin grows stronger. Growing Retail Investor Confidence: While institutional money is a significant factor, renewed interest from retail investors also plays a crucial role. As Bitcoin gains mainstream media attention with its impressive price movements, more individual investors are entering the market, contributing to the buying volume and overall market liquidity. Ease of access through various platforms also lowers the barrier to entry. Technological Advancements and Ecosystem Growth: Beyond price, the Bitcoin ecosystem continues to evolve. Developments in scaling solutions like the Lightning Network, improvements in security protocols, and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications on Bitcoin-compatible layers are enhancing its utility and appeal.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Explosive Ascent: BTC Soars Past $119,000 – What’s Next? The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement! In a move that has captivated investors and analysts alike, Bitcoin (BTC) has emphatically surged past the significant $119,000 mark . According to real-time market monitoring, the flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at an impressive $119,019.83 on the Binance USDT market. This latest Bitcoin price surge isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful wave of momentum that has many wondering: what’s fueling this incredible ascent, and what does it mean for the future of digital assets? Let’s dive deep into the forces driving this monumental rally and explore what could be next for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. What’s Igniting This Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Surge? Understanding the catalysts behind Bitcoin’s recent rally requires a look at several interconnected factors. This isn’t a singular event but rather the culmination of various macroeconomic trends, technological advancements, and shifting investor sentiment. Here are some key drivers: Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows: A major driver of the current Bitcoin price surge is the increasing interest and investment from institutional players. The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. These ETFs have seen substantial inflows, signaling a growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Large financial institutions, hedge funds, and even corporate treasuries are now allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, providing significant buying pressure. The Bitcoin Halving Event: Historically, Bitcoin’s price has seen significant upward movement following its quadrennial halving events. The most recent halving, which occurred earlier this year, reduced the reward for mining new blocks by half, thereby decreasing the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. This supply shock, combined with steady or increasing demand, naturally creates upward pressure on the price. It’s a classic economic principle of scarcity at play. Learn more about the impact of Bitcoin halvings.

The series notched over $24.6m in weekly volume last week, its highest tally since March, marking a 416% rise from the prior week, data from the OpenSea collection showed. That spike in momentum pushed CryptoPunks to the top of the NFT leaderboard on CryptoSlam , where it accounted for more than $8.9m in daily sales as of July 29. This was nearly six times higher than the next-best collection, Polygon-based Courtyard, which posted $1.4m. CryptoPunks Rally Tied to GameSquare’s High-Profile Acquisition Activity soared across the board. Transactions jumped over 566%, while the number of buyers increased 200%. The average sale price climbed from roughly $140,000 two weeks ago to $182,000 last week. The floor price, a key indicator of collection health, rose from around 40 ETH to 47.5 ETH. It was last up 4.6% at 53.85 ETH. The recent frenzy can be traced in part to GameSquare’s high-profile acquisition of Punk #5577 , one of just 24 rare “Ape Punks,” for $5.15m in preferred shares.

2025-07-29 06:50:11+00:00,Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio: Decoding Crucial Market Insights,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio: Decoding Crucial Market Insights In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, understanding market sentiment is paramount for any trader. While price charts and technical indicators offer valuable clues, delving into the intricacies of derivatives markets, particularly BTC perpetual futures , can provide a deeper look into the collective mindset of traders. One of the most insightful metrics in this regard is the Bitcoin long-short ratio . This ratio acts as a powerful barometer, indicating whether the majority of traders are betting on a price increase (long) or a price decrease (short). Let’s dive into the latest 24-hour data and unravel what it could mean for the future trajectory of Bitcoin. What Exactly is the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio? At its core, the Bitcoin long-short ratio is a simple yet profound indicator. It measures the proportion of long positions versus short positions on perpetual futures contracts across various cryptocurrency exchanges. Perpetual futures are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without an expiration date, making them highly popular in the crypto space. Long Positions: These are bets that the price of Bitcoin will go up. Traders who open long positions profit if Bitcoin’s value increases. Short Positions: These are bets that the price of Bitcoin will go down. Traders who open short positions profit if Bitcoin’s value decreases. The Ratio: When the long-short ratio is high (more long positions), it suggests a bullish sentiment among traders. Conversely, a low ratio (more short positions) points towards a bearish outlook. Understanding this ratio provides a snapshot of the prevailing market sentiment, which can often precede significant price movements in the underlying asset, Bitcoin. Why Does the Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Matter for Traders? For anyone involved in crypto trading, particularly with BTC perpetual futures , the Bitcoin long-short ratio is more than just a statistic; it’s a window into the collective psychology of the market. Here’s why it holds significant weight: Gauging Market Sentiment: It directly reflects whether the majority of leveraged traders are feeling bullish or bearish. A strong bias in either direction can signal potential reversals or continuations. Identifying Overbought/Oversold Conditions: Extremely high long ratios might indicate an over-leveraged long market, potentially ripe for a cascade of liquidations if prices drop slightly. Similarly, an overly short market could be poised for a short squeeze. Spotting Divergences: Sometimes, the ratio might diverge from the actual price action. For instance, if Bitcoin’s price is rising but the long-short ratio is decreasing, it could suggest that the rally lacks conviction from leveraged traders. Complementing Other Indicators: While powerful, the ratio is best used in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and fundamental news to form a comprehensive trading strategy. By monitoring this ratio, traders can gain an edge, anticipating potential shifts in momentum and adjusting their strategies accordingly. The Latest Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Snapshot: What Are Traders Saying? Let’s delve into the most recent 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures across key exchanges. This snapshot provides a clear picture of where the sentiment currently lies among leveraged traders. 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Category/Exchange Long Positions (%) Short Positions (%) Total Market 47.42% 52.58% Binance 45.82% 54.18% Bybit 45.48% 54.52% Gate.io 49.71% 50.29% Interpreting the Numbers: What Does This Bitcoin Long-Short Ratio Tell Us? Looking at the aggregate data, we observe a slight bearish tilt in the overall market sentiment for BTC perpetual futures . With 47.42% long positions and 52.58% short positions, it indicates that a marginally higher proportion of leveraged traders are currently betting on a decline in Bitcoin’s price. Breaking it down by exchange reveals some interesting nuances: Binance and Bybit: Both major exchanges show a more pronounced bearish bias, with short positions significantly outweighing long positions (54.18% and 54.52% respectively). This suggests that a substantial portion of their user base is anticipating a downward price movement. Gate.io: In contrast, Gate.io presents a nearly balanced scenario, with short positions only slightly edging out long positions (50.29% vs. 49.71%). This indicates a more neutral or divided sentiment among traders on this particular platform compared to the others. This distribution highlights that while the overall sentiment leans bearish, there isn’t a unanimous consensus across all platforms. Such slight variations can sometimes be attributed to different user demographics, trading strategies prevalent on each exchange, or even slight delays in data aggregation.

The company would also officially set up a new headquarters in either Texas or Florida, Bloomberg reported . In the first phase, Bitmain intends to recruit about 250 local employees for manufacturing and site-level maintenance units. According to Irene Gao, Bitmain’s global business chief, the company will start its initial output in early 2026 and begin full-scale production later in the year. Gao calls the US a “unique opportunity” at a time when Trump’s administration is riding towards pro-crypto policies and a “Made in USA” strategy. The shift is further driven by the US industrial policies, tariffs, and China’s 2021 mining ban. Last month, Trump’s family-associated crypto venture raised $220 million to buy Bitcoin and digital asset mining equipment. US Labor Costs Are Higher: Bitmain Gao noted that local production would speed up deliveries and repairs for US customers, while labor costs remain high. “The move still makes commercial sense,” she added, especially when there is uncertainty around tariffs. Alternatively, Chinese supply chains are under fire, with Trump’s trade war disrupting several businesses, including Bitmain’s US expansion goals. Beijing-based company shipments have been held up at several ports with heightened scrutiny by the Customs department. If established, Bitmain would join America’s top publicly-listed miners, including Mara Holdings, Riot Platforms and CleanSpart. Additionally, another North American Bitcoin mining giant, Hut8, is already planning a full stock merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, under the American Bitcoin brand. Hut8 purchased 31,145 Bitmain machines to upgrade its mining fleet in November 2024. Chinese Bitcoin Miners Pivot to US Soil During President Joe Biden’s administration, Chinese Bitcoin miners operating in the US drew security concerns. Last year, Biden ordered a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency mining company to sell land near a Wyoming nuclear missile base, citing national security concerns. Per the University of Cambridge report, three biggest makers of Bitcoin (BTC) mining machines — Bitmain, Canaan, and MicroBT, manufacture 99% of the world’s BTC mining hardware.

2025-07-29 07:00:52+00:00,"Bitcoin’s Rally Might Be Running on Fumes, Analyst Warns of August Turning Point","Bitcoin’s price is beginning to recover after a brief period of stagnation, trading at $118,945 at the time of writing. This marks a 1% increase over the past 24 hours, with the asset briefly reaching a high of $119,754 during the same period. The recent upward movement suggests a cautious return of buying interest, though analysts warn that market participants should remain aware of deeper trends influencing price action. Among the key voices weighing in is CryptoQuant contributor Yonsei Dent, who highlighted a familiar pattern in Bitcoin’s current on-chain metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Endures One Of The Most Intense Bear Weeks Of This Bull Cycle – Details MVRV Ratio Signals Possible Peak by Late August According to Dent, the 365-day moving average (DMA) of the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has proven to be a historically useful indicator of market cycle tops. Drawing parallels to 2021, when the MVRV 365DMA formed a double-top pattern followed by the start of a bear market, Dent suggested that Bitcoin could be approaching a similar inflection point. In his analysis titled “MVRV Points to a Potential Cycle Peak — Late August May Be the Real Turning Point,” Dent noted that the structure of the current cycle resembles the double-top formation seen in 2021. He projects that if the same six-month interval is applied, the market could experience a peak by around September 10. However, Dent emphasized that the MVRV ratio is a lagging indicator, and thus a reversal in Bitcoin’s trend may begin as early as late August. The analyst also linked this potential turning point to broader macroeconomic narratives, such as speculation around Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. While Dent did not predict an exact price top, he urged market participants to treat this period as one that requires heightened attention to risk management. “Let on-chain timing guide your strategy — now is the time to tighten risk management and stay nimble,” he advised. Bitcoin Liquidity Metrics Suggest Potential Saturation In a separate post, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain examined the Bitcoin Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) as another tool to evaluate current market strength. The SSR compares Bitcoin’s market capitalization to that of all stablecoins, offering a window into liquidity dynamics within the crypto ecosystem. Arab Chain explained that stablecoins act as the fiat-equivalent within the market, and their supply levels relative to Bitcoin help measure the purchasing power available to fuel price movements. According to Arab Chain, a rising SSR indicates a lower presence of stablecoins relative to Bitcoin, which could mean that price gains are occurring despite limited liquidity. This scenario suggests that the current upward momentum may be encountering diminishing support from new capital inflows.

Bitcoin’s price is beginning to recover after a brief period of stagnation, trading at $118,945 at the time of writing. This marks a 1% increase over the past 24 hours, with the asset briefly reaching a high of $119,754 during the same period. The recent upward movement suggests a cautious return of buying interest, though analysts warn that market participants should remain aware of deeper trends influencing price action. Among the key voices weighing in is CryptoQuant contributor Yonsei Dent, who highlighted a familiar pattern in Bitcoin’s current on-chain metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Endures One Of The Most Intense Bear Weeks Of This Bull Cycle – Details MVRV Ratio Signals Possible Peak by Late August According to Dent, the 365-day moving average (DMA) of the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has proven to be a historically useful indicator of market cycle tops. Drawing parallels to 2021, when the MVRV 365DMA formed a double-top pattern followed by the start of a bear market, Dent suggested that Bitcoin could be approaching a similar inflection point. In his analysis titled “MVRV Points to a Potential Cycle Peak — Late August May Be the Real Turning Point,” Dent noted that the structure of the current cycle resembles the double-top formation seen in 2021. He projects that if the same six-month interval is applied, the market could experience a peak by around September 10. However, Dent emphasized that the MVRV ratio is a lagging indicator, and thus a reversal in Bitcoin’s trend may begin as early as late August.

According to a New York Times report, payment cards provided to participants of NYC’s Summer Youth Employment Program were suddenly allowing users to take out more money from ATMs than they should have been able to. The payment cards issued to thousands of young people in the program normally give users access only to that week’s earnings – at the most a few hundred dollars. But this time, the payment cards gave users the ability to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at each ATM. In total, some $17 million was fraudulently withdrawn on the payment cards between July 11th and July 13th. An estimated 30,000 cards were issued to 14- to 24-year-olds who were unable to receive payment by direct deposit. The NYC Police Department’s Financial Crimes Task Force is now investigating the matter. Anonymous law enforcement officials say some of the program participants sold their cards for $1,000 apiece. Mark Zustovich, a spokesman for the agency that oversees the program, the NYC Department of Youth and Community Development, says participants may have been pressured by criminals to abuse their payment cards. “We are deeply disturbed by scammers preying on our participants just as they started their work assignments to support themselves and their families.” It remans unclear at time of writing what made it possible for payment cards to allow for the fraudulent withdrawals and who will ultimately be responsible for covering the costs.

This vision is rapidly becoming a reality as Bitmain, a titan in the Bitcoin mining rig manufacturing industry, sets its sights on establishing its inaugural Bitmain U.S. facility . This isn’t just another factory; it’s a monumental step that promises to reshape global supply chains, invigorate domestic manufacturing, and fortify the infrastructure of the digital economy. For years, the vast majority of Bitcoin mining hardware has originated from overseas, primarily Asia. While efficient, this concentration has presented vulnerabilities related to supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and logistics challenges. Bitmain’s strategic pivot to the United States signals a profound shift, indicating a global recalibration towards localized production and enhanced resilience within the crypto ecosystem. It’s a move that has the potential to impact everything from job markets to national security, making the U.S. a central player not just in crypto adoption, but in its very creation. The Genesis of the Bitmain U.S. Facility: Why Now? The decision by Bitmain to establish a Bitmain U.S. facility is a reflection of several converging global and economic trends. The past few years have highlighted the fragility of highly centralized supply chains, particularly during events like the pandemic and various geopolitical conflicts. Companies worldwide are seeking to diversify their manufacturing footprints to mitigate risks and ensure continuity of operations. As reported by The Block, citing Bloomberg, Bitmain is actively working to finalize a location in either Texas or Florida by the close of the third quarter of this year. The ambitious timeline projects manufacturing operations to commence as early as 2026. This isn’t a hasty decision but a calculated move to capitalize on the unique advantages the U.S. offers: Energy Availability and Cost: Certain U.S. states, particularly Texas, boast abundant and relatively inexpensive energy resources, crucial for the energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining and, by extension, the manufacturing of mining rigs. Political Stability and Regulatory Clarity (Emerging): While crypto regulations are still evolving, the U.S. offers a more predictable legal and political environment compared to some other regions, which can be attractive for long-term investments. Skilled Workforce: The U.S. has a strong pool of engineering, manufacturing, and technical talent, essential for operating a sophisticated production facility. Proximity to Market: Establishing a facility within a significant market like the U.S. reduces shipping times and costs for North American customers, improving efficiency and customer satisfaction. This strategic move is not just about Bitmain; it reflects a broader industry trend towards decentralizing critical infrastructure for the blockchain economy. Unpacking the Strategic Locations: Texas or Florida for the Bitmain U.S. Facility? The choice between Texas and Florida for the new Bitmain U.S. facility is a fascinating one, each state presenting its own compelling set of advantages and considerations. Both have emerged as hotspots for cryptocurrency-related businesses, but for different reasons. Factor Texas Considerations Florida Considerations Energy Infrastructure & Cost Abundant and relatively cheap renewable (wind, solar) and natural gas energy. Deregulated market offers competitive pricing. Existing large-scale mining operations provide an ecosystem. Growing renewable energy sector, but potentially higher base energy costs compared to Texas. Less established large-scale mining ecosystem. Regulatory Environment Generally pro-crypto legislation and business-friendly policies. Active engagement from state lawmakers to attract blockchain businesses. Emerging as a crypto-friendly state with supportive governors and mayors. Focus on innovation and attracting tech businesses. Land & Logistics Vast tracts of affordable land suitable for large industrial facilities. Central U.S. location with strong transportation networks. More developed and potentially denser urban areas.

Recently, the crypto community buzzed with news of a significant on-chain event: a massive Bitcoin transfer . According to Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, a staggering 2,000 BTC, valued at approximately $238 million at the time of the transaction, moved from a Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) address to an unknown wallet. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a colossal movement that sparks questions and speculation across the digital asset landscape. What does such a large Bitcoin transfer signify, and what are its potential implications for the broader market? What Exactly Happened with This Massive Bitcoin Transfer? The core of the news is straightforward yet profound. On a recent day, Whale Alert, known for its real-time tracking of large crypto movements, flagged a particular transaction that immediately sent ripples through the crypto community. This automated service continuously monitors blockchain activity, alerting users to unusually large transfers that could indicate significant shifts in market dynamics. In this instance, the alert detailed the movement of a substantial amount of Bitcoin: Asset Transferred: 2,000 BTC Approximate Fiat Value: $238,000,000 (based on Bitcoin’s price at the time of transfer) Origin Address: Identified as a Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) wallet Destination Address: An ‘unknown wallet’ – meaning an address not publicly associated with an exchange, known institution, or individual. This particular Bitcoin transfer is noteworthy not just for its immense value but also for its origin. Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) is an ERC-20 token that represents Bitcoin on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing BTC holders to participate in Ethereum’s vibrant decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The movement of such a substantial amount from a WBTC address implies a shift away from a DeFi-centric environment, or perhaps a consolidation, raising immediate questions about the whale’s intentions. Was it a strategic move to exit a DeFi position, a preparation for an over-the-counter (OTC) deal, or something else entirely? The transparency of the blockchain reveals the ‘what,’ but the ‘why’ often remains a captivating mystery. Why Does a 2,000 BTC Transfer Matter to the Crypto World? In the cryptocurrency market, large transactions, often referred to as ‘whale movements,’ are closely watched indicators. Whales are individuals or entities holding significant amounts of crypto, and their actions can have a ripple effect across the entire ecosystem. A Bitcoin transfer of this magnitude matters for several compelling reasons: Market Sentiment Influence: Such large movements can significantly influence investor sentiment. If the market perceives a whale is preparing to sell a large sum, it might trigger fear and a downward price movement. Conversely, if it’s seen as a move to secure funds for long-term holding or an OTC deal, it could be neutral or even perceived as a positive signal for future demand. Potential for Volatility: While this particular transfer was to an ‘unknown wallet’ and not directly to an exchange, the possibility always exists that these funds could eventually be moved to an exchange. Such a move could significantly impact market liquidity and potentially trigger price fluctuations, either upwards if bought or downwards if sold. Insight into Whale Behavior: Tracking these transfers provides invaluable clues about the strategies of major holders. Are they accumulating more assets, distributing their holdings, or simply rebalancing their vast portfolios? These insights can help analysts identify broader market trends. Network Activity and Health: The execution of such a massive Bitcoin transfer highlights the continued utility, security, and robust activity on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. It demonstrates the underlying infrastructure’s capacity to handle colossal value transfers efficiently and securely. These large transactions act as a pulse check for the market, offering glimpses into the actions of its most influential participants and shaping narratives around Bitcoin’s immediate future. Demystifying Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) in Large Bitcoin Transfers To fully grasp the significance of this Bitcoin transfer , it’s crucial to understand Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and its role in the broader crypto landscape.

2025-07-29 07:21:08+00:00,Has a Correction Signal Appeared in Bitcoin and Altcoins? Singapore-based Analysis Company Examined and Explained Options,"Cryptocurrency analysis firm QCP Capital has published a comprehensive market assessment for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) following the recent market volatility. The report particularly highlighted Ethereum''s rising momentum and its superior performance in spot ETF inflows. According to QCP Capital, Ethereum is on a remarkable rally, approaching the $4,000 level for the first time since December 2023. Spot ETF inflows into ETH have outpaced Bitcoin ETF inflows over the past seven days, suggesting growing institutional interest in the Ethereum narrative. The company stated that Ethereum''s market capitalization is still around one-fifth of Bitcoin''s, adding, “It takes much less institutional or treasury capital to move the price of ETH compared to BTC.” In recent weeks, while ETH has dominated the news, Bitcoin has demonstrated quiet resilience. Despite a slowdown in spot BTC ETF inflows, prices have held firm. The 80,000 BTC sold by a long-term investor last Friday was absorbed without causing significant market panic. The sudden surge in volatility quickly reversed. According to the analytics firm, BTC dominance remained stable at around 60%, indicating that investors continue to view Bitcoin as a store of value. QCP Capital noted that this isn''t a complete shift towards altcoins, but that ETH and other major projects still have room to increase their market share. As you may recall, at ETH''s peak in November 2021, BTC dominance had fallen below 45%, while ETH''s was approaching 20%. Related News: BREAKING: SEC Updates Two Cryptocurrency Spot ETF Applications - One Linked to Trump According to the report, the market is showing signs of oversold positioning in the short term. Open interest in perpetual futures is approaching year-highs of $45 billion for BTC and $28 billion for ETH. At the same time, funding rates on major exchanges have risen above 15%. QCP Capital stated that these levels haven''t yet signaled a major correction, but even a small trigger could trigger a chain reaction sell-off similar to last Friday. Indeed, some large investors took profits by closing their 3.6k/4k/4.2k ETH Call Fly positions due September 26, 2025. Meanwhile, there was strong demand for $110,000 BTC Put options due August 8, 2025, indicating a search for protection against near-term risks. Profit-taking is expected around $4,000 for ETH and $120,000 for BTC in the coming days. However, QCP Capital predicts that, given the current momentum, strong trends, and supporting macroeconomic factors, the market will continue to buy on pullbacks. The rapid recovery observed after Friday''s decline, in particular, suggests that institutional investors are continuing their “buy the dip” strategy. *This is not investment advice.

Cryptocurrency analysis firm QCP Capital has published a comprehensive market assessment for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) following the recent market volatility. The report particularly highlighted Ethereum''s rising momentum and its superior performance in spot ETF inflows. According to QCP Capital, Ethereum is on a remarkable rally, approaching the $4,000 level for the first time since December 2023. Spot ETF inflows into ETH have outpaced Bitcoin ETF inflows over the past seven days, suggesting growing institutional interest in the Ethereum narrative. The company stated that Ethereum''s market capitalization is still around one-fifth of Bitcoin''s, adding, “It takes much less institutional or treasury capital to move the price of ETH compared to BTC.” In recent weeks, while ETH has dominated the news, Bitcoin has demonstrated quiet resilience. Despite a slowdown in spot BTC ETF inflows, prices have held firm. The 80,000 BTC sold by a long-term investor last Friday was absorbed without causing significant market panic. The sudden surge in volatility quickly reversed. According to the analytics firm, BTC dominance remained stable at around 60%, indicating that investors continue to view Bitcoin as a store of value. QCP Capital noted that this isn''t a complete shift towards altcoins, but that ETH and other major projects still have room to increase their market share. As you may recall, at ETH''s peak in November 2021, BTC dominance had fallen below 45%, while ETH''s was approaching 20%. Related News: BREAKING: SEC Updates Two Cryptocurrency Spot ETF Applications - One Linked to Trump According to the report, the market is showing signs of oversold positioning in the short term. Open interest in perpetual futures is approaching year-highs of $45 billion for BTC and $28 billion for ETH. At the same time, funding rates on major exchanges have risen above 15%. QCP Capital stated that these levels haven''t yet signaled a major correction, but even a small trigger could trigger a chain reaction sell-off similar to last Friday. Indeed, some large investors took profits by closing their 3.6k/4k/4.2k ETH Call Fly positions due September 26, 2025. Meanwhile, there was strong demand for $110,000 BTC Put options due August 8, 2025, indicating a search for protection against near-term risks. Profit-taking is expected around $4,000 for ETH and $120,000 for BTC in the coming days. However, QCP Capital predicts that, given the current momentum, strong trends, and supporting macroeconomic factors, the market will continue to buy on pullbacks. The rapid recovery observed after Friday''s decline, in particular, suggests that institutional investors are continuing their “buy the dip” strategy. *This is not investment advice.

At first glance, it seemed like a niche shift. But now, the bigger picture is becoming clear: Ethereum is entering a new institutional chapter , and Lubin is at the forefront. ETH’s Utility Meets Real-World Demand Speaking with Bloomberg , Lubin said the long-awaited moment for Ethereum has arrived. For years, Bitcoin dominated the narrative as a digital store of value, while Ethereum was viewed as a platform with potential. But now, thanks to staking, programmability, and growing regulatory clarity, Ethereum is becoming a critical part of real-world financial strategies. Institutions are no longer just exploring Ethereum, they’re integrating it. Lubin emphasized that Ethereum offers more than just value storage; it’s an engine for programmable finance and decentralized infrastructure. “We believe that we’ll be able to accumulate more Ether per fully diluted share much faster than any other Ethereum-based project, or certainly faster than the Bitcoin-based projects,” Lubin told Bloomberg Television on Monday . Companies Are Building Ethereum Treasuries A clear sign of this shift is how companies are holding and using ETH. SharpLink Gaming now holds over 360,000 ETH, worth more than $1.3 billion, as part of its core treasury strategy. Inspired by this, BitMine Immersion, a former Bitcoin mining firm, pivoted to Ethereum and amassed 566,776 ETH worth over $2.1 billion in just a few weeks. The results were immediate: both companies saw a stock surge, and Ethereum’s price climbed past $3,600 in July after dipping to $1,450 in April. These companies aren’t just holding ETH, they’re staking it. That means their holdings are generating passive income and actively supporting the network, making Ethereum a productive, yield-bearing asset in a way Bitcoin is not. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Bull Run Faces Reality Check as 10x Research Warns of Market Slowdown , Vitalik Buterin: Building for the Long Term While Lubin steers Ethereum into corporate treasuries, Vitalik Buterin continues shaping the protocol’s technical roadmap .

2025-07-29 07:35:10+00:00,Bitcoin Correction: Unpacking the Alarming Dip as U.S. Demand Wanes,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Correction: Unpacking the Alarming Dip as U.S. Demand Wanes The cryptocurrency market is an ever-evolving landscape, often characterized by rapid shifts and unexpected turns. Currently, the buzz among traders and analysts revolves around a potential extended Bitcoin correction . What exactly is fueling this growing concern, and how might it impact your crypto portfolio? Recent data points to a significant shift in U.S. investor behavior, suggesting that the current market downturn might persist longer than some anticipate. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Correction? At the heart of the recent market unease is a key metric known as the 60-day BTC premium. This indicator, as reported by CoinDesk, measures the price difference between Bitcoin (BTC) traded on Coinbase, a popular U.S.-based exchange, and Binance, a global exchange. Historically, a positive premium on Coinbase has indicated strong buying pressure from U.S. investors, often signaling bullish sentiment. However, for the first time since late May, this 60-day BTC premium has turned negative. What does a negative premium signify? It suggests that U.S. investors are either selling more Bitcoin than they are buying, or their buying interest has significantly diminished compared to global markets. This reduced buying pressure from a traditionally dominant market participant like the U.S. can have profound implications for Bitcoin’s price trajectory. To better understand the implications, consider the following: Positive Premium: Coinbase price is higher than Binance. Indicates strong U.S. demand, often leading to price rallies. Negative Premium: Coinbase price is lower than Binance. Suggests weaker U.S. demand, potentially signaling further price declines or a prolonged Bitcoin correction . Zero Premium: Prices are roughly equal. Indicates balanced demand between the U.S. and global markets. The shift to a negative premium is a clear signal that a significant source of demand is currently on the sidelines or actively taking profits, contributing directly to the ongoing Bitcoin correction . Why is U.S. Investor Demand Crucial for Bitcoin’s Health? The United States plays an undeniable role in the global cryptocurrency market. Its influence stems from several factors, including a large and sophisticated investor base, significant institutional adoption, and the presence of major crypto companies and regulatory frameworks. Here’s why U.S. investor sentiment is so pivotal: Institutional Clout: The U.S. is home to numerous institutional investors, hedge funds, and publicly traded companies that have embraced Bitcoin. Their large-scale buying or selling can move markets dramatically. When these big players reduce their exposure or halt new investments, it creates a substantial vacuum in demand. Retail Participation: Millions of individual U.S. investors actively participate in the crypto market. While individual trades might be small, their collective action can significantly impact market dynamics. A decline in retail interest or an increase in profit-taking can amplify downward trends. Regulatory Influence: U.S. regulatory developments often set precedents for other nations. Uncertainty or stricter stances from U.S. regulators can deter investment, not just domestically but globally, affecting overall market sentiment and contributing to a Bitcoin correction . Access to Capital: U.S. markets provide deep liquidity and access to capital, making them attractive for large-volume trades. A slowdown in this liquidity can lead to less efficient price discovery and increased volatility. Therefore, when U.S. investor demand weakens, it’s not just a domestic issue; it sends ripples across the entire global crypto ecosystem, making a sustained Bitcoin correction a more likely scenario. Has This Bitcoin Correction Happened Before? Lessons from History For seasoned crypto enthusiasts, market corrections are a familiar, albeit often painful, part of the journey. Bitcoin has a history of dramatic price swings, including significant pullbacks that have tested investor resolve. Understanding these past cycles can provide valuable perspective on the current Bitcoin correction . Consider these historical patterns: 2017-2018 Bear Market: Following its parabolic rise to nearly $20,000, Bitcoin entered a prolonged bear market, shedding over 80% of its value. This period saw a significant drop in retail enthusiasm and a re-evaluation of the market. 2021-2022 Correction: After hitting all-time highs above $69,000, Bitcoin experienced another substantial downturn, driven by macroeconomic concerns, regulatory crackdowns, and a general deleveraging in the crypto space. Shifts in Dominant Demand: Historically, periods of strong Asian market demand have sometimes counterbalanced Western market weakness, and vice-versa. The current situation, where U.S. demand is specifically highlighted as weakening, suggests a significant shift in a primary demand driver.

This period saw a significant drop in retail enthusiasm and a re-evaluation of the market. 2021-2022 Correction: After hitting all-time highs above $69,000, Bitcoin experienced another substantial downturn, driven by macroeconomic concerns, regulatory crackdowns, and a general deleveraging in the crypto space. Shifts in Dominant Demand: Historically, periods of strong Asian market demand have sometimes counterbalanced Western market weakness, and vice-versa. The current situation, where U.S. demand is specifically highlighted as weakening, suggests a significant shift in a primary demand driver. Thes"

The total aggregate inflow, while lower than previous days, was $65.2 million, or 17,549 ETH. This is the lowest for three weeks, yet still higher than the daily production figure of 2,571 ETH, or around $9.7 million. “Even on slow days, the ETH ETFs are gobbling up all of the supply,” said industry educator Anthony Sassano. Net new ETH issuance today: ~2,571 ETH ($9.7 million). Net inflows into the ETH ETFs today: ~17,549 ETH ($65.77 million). The ETH ETFs bought 7x more ETH than was net issued by the network today. Even on slow days, the ETH ETFs are gobbling up all of the supply. Accelerate! — sassal.eth/acc (@sassal0x) July 29, 2025 $5 Billion Infows in 17 Days BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ) had another three-figure inflow day with $132 million, but that was offset by Fidelity’s FETH fund outflowing $49.2 million, according to Farside Investors. ETF analyst Eric Balchunas reported that ETHA was the 17th most traded ETF today, in the top 0.4% of all ETFs, “first time I recall seeing it in there,” he said. Spot Ethereum ETFs have not seen an outflow day since July 2, almost a month ago. Moreover, they have seen a whopping $3.8 billion in inflows over the past ten trading days. The inflow streak is now 17 days with almost $5.2 billion in new capital, and the record streak was 19 days from May to June, though only $1.4 billion in inflows, observed industry expert Nate Geraci. Ethereum issuance is currently inflationary, but only at 0.12% per year. Comparatively, Bitcoin issuance is 1.34% per year, but both assets are being accumulated at faster rates by ETPs and corporations. Over the past week, the ETH supply has increased by around 17,910 ETH, according to Ultrasound.money. However, spot ETFs consumed almost all of that in one slow day on Monday. Where to Next For ETH? The asset has retreated slightly over the past 24 hours but was still trading around a multi-month high of $3,800 at the time of writing. Position trader Bob Loukas said it “still feels like juice in the tank,” predicting a move to $4,700 in the short term, “if we get the BTC move over next four weeks.” Additionally, August is usually a bullish month for Ethereum during post-Bitcoin halving bull market years, with big gains in 2017 and 2021.

Investors seemed unconvinced by the plan to make BitMine a major holder and staker of Ethereum. The dip came after shares slid over 10% during regular hours to $35, then dropped another 15% in after‑hours trading. BitMine Shares Plunge Despite Big Claims According to FundStrat’s Tom Lee, BitMine plans to hold 5% of Ethereum’s total supply and become a “made in America validator network.” He highlighted that BitMine already has 600,000 ETH on its balance sheet—worth more than $2 billion at current prices. Lee even floated the idea that Ether could reach an implied valuation of $60,000, citing unnamed research firms. But those bold figures failed to calm the market. 10/18We asked several research firms to give us “replacement” value (of Wall Street) to value ETH – this is for illustrative purposes only– implied value for ETH is $60,000– ETH currently ~$3,800 pic.twitter.com/mXa5uCZukv — Bitmine BMNR (@BitMNR) July 28, 2025 Analysts had pointed out that BitMine’s stock had wildly surged earlier this month.

That rally was met with a wave of profit‑taking once the plan was fully laid out. Many traders sold into the strength, and the mood shifted quickly when shareholders saw the fine print. Investors Question Execution Risks Based on reports from Kronos Research, treasury rollouts on this scale require a solid plan to protect capital and maintain liquidity. Vincent Liu, Kronos’s chief investment officer, warned that without clear steps for custody and staking infrastructure, holding large amounts of Ether could create big swings in value. And those swings spooked some investors when Lee’s “chairman’s message” failed to pin down exact timelines or reveal audit partners. On top of that, the implied $60,000 target for Ether came from sources that remain unnamed. That lack of transparency set off alarm bells.

2025-07-29 08:00:38+00:00,Analyst Says The Patient Will Be Rewarded As Ethereum Price Retests 4-Year Resistance,"Despite what is akin to a bull market with the Bitcoin price hitting multiple new all-time highs, the Ethereum price continues to hit major resistances in its campaign for new highs. The most recent is the resistance push at the $3,800, which perfectly aligns with the 4-year resistance line that has kept the leading altcoin by market cap from hitting new all-time highs. However, as Ethereum once again gears up for a retest, this time could be the chart that signals the breakout. Ethereum On The Verge Of Breakout Crypto analyst MMCrypto highlighted a possible breakout on the Ethereum price chart after the altcoin moved back toward a 4-year resistance trendline. This trendline had begun back in 2021 when the Ethereum price had hit its $4,800 all-time high, and since then, it has become the resistant trendline to beat for the ETH price to rally to new highs. Related Reading: Dormant Whale Sells $80,000 BTC, But Bitcoin Bulls Still In Control Over the last four years, this resistance trendline has held firmly, beating the Ethereum price back down from the $4,000 level. This has prevented a rally toward its $4,800 and made the $5,000 expected target push even farther away. But now, there could be another opportunity for Ethereum to turn the tide and break this resistance once and for all. Currently, the ETH price is still trending below $4,000, suggesting that the bears are still holding the resistance line. With the price trading below this resistance, MMCrypto points out that ETH has now been underperforming for four years. Given this, a large number of investors have lost money on their investments or haven’t seen a profit. The major target now is for the resistance to be broken. The crypto analyst explains that once this happens, then the Ethereum price could see a monumental pump from here. This pump, he explains, will be fueled by investors who have yet to realize any profit on their ETH holdings over the last four years. Related Reading: XRP Bullish Cross Playing Out Again: $9 Or $24 Next? With the expectation that the resistance trendline will be broken, the analyst urges investors to be patient. He points out that once the pump begins, those who were patient will be the ones to reap the profits of this ETH price action. Additionally, Ethereum will not be the only altcoin to benefit from a pump. Previous altcoin seasons have been sparked by movements in the Ethereum price, and if ETH is able to break toward a new all-time high, then the altcoin market is expected to follow suit. “The Ethereum Pump if & when it happens, will have a broad influence on the whole Crypto Space & take many Altcoins with it! Be ready, be prepared,” the analyst said in closing.

He points out that once the pump begins, those who were patient will be the ones to reap the profits of this ETH price action. Additionally, Ethereum will not be the only altcoin to benefit from a pump. Previous altcoin seasons have been sparked by movements in the Ethereum price, and if ETH is able to break toward a new all-time high, then the altcoin market is expected to follow suit. “The Ethereum Pump if & when it happens, will have a broad influence on the whole Crypto Space & take many Altcoins with it! Be ready, be prepared,” the analyst said in closing. Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com"

2025-07-29 08:05:17+00:00,Best crypto to buy now ahead of the Fed meet,"Bitcoin hovered around $119,000 on Tuesday, with traders largely sidelined as they await clearer signals on US trade policy and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate decision. After surging to an all-time high above $123,000 earlier in July, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has remained rangebound, showing little momentum in either direction. The subdued price action reflects broader market caution as investors digest the potential impact of renewed global trade tensions and the Fed’s next move on interest rates. With the central bank widely expected to hold rates steady later this week, focus will turn to Chair Jerome Powell’s guidance on inflation and future policy shifts. However, in this cautious environment, Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU), a meme-inspired token, has raised over $1 million within a day of its presale launch, signalling a shift in investor appetite amid a lull in major crypto price action. The Fed meeting Ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on July 29–30, US President Donald Trump has renewed his calls for lower interest rates, but the Federal Reserve appears poised to hold firm. According to CME FedWatch data, there is a 96.9% probability that the Fed will keep its benchmark rate unchanged—between 4.25% and 4.5%—marking the fifth consecutive meeting in 2025 without a cut. The central bank has maintained this range since January, defying repeated presidential pressure to ease monetary policy amid strong economic performance. Chair Jerome Powell and the Committee have consistently signalled a preference to wait and assess the broader effects of existing economic policies, including the Trump administration’s tariffs, before adjusting rates. Despite Trump’s visit to the Fed last week, where he again urged cuts citing the “booming” US economy, policymakers have so far resisted. Markets will watch closely for any change in tone from Powell following the July meeting, especially as inflation trends and trade-related uncertainty continue to shape the Fed’s path forward. The best crypto to buy now has raised over $1 million The presale for Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU) brings rare structure and urgency to an early-stage token offering, combining a fixed timeline, transparent pricing model, and clear path to listing—at a time when open-ended presales have begun to wear thin on investors. Split across 15 stages, the crypto presale increases BPENGU’s price by 5% at each step, leading to a cumulative rise of 75% from Stage 1 to Stage 15. Early entrants stand to capture notional gains of over 75% by the time the token lists. So far, the presale has raised over $1 million, with the next price jump scheduled within the next 25 hours. The escalating price structure is designed to reward early participation and drive sustained momentum—an intentional contrast to the prolonged, often delayed presales that have tested investor patience. The presale is capped at 30 days, ending August 27 or sooner if the $10 million hard cap is met. A claim and listing date of September 2 has already been confirmed, giving investors the rare advantage of knowing the token’s public timeline from the outset. That clarity has struck a chord with buyers seeking transparency and timely execution. With its Bitcoin integration, meme-powered branding, and strong early demand, BPENGU is shaping up as a serious contender in the current altcoin rotation—and possibly the next meme project to break into the mainstream.

2025-07-29 08:15:43+00:00,Bernstein says Ethereum treasuries face liquidity risks,"Equity research and brokerage firm Bernstein revealed that Ethereum treasuries are generating more on the digital asset than their Bitcoin-focused counterparts. According to the report, the treasuries are generating staking rewards in addition to holding the virtual asset as a reserve asset. On Monday, the analyst wrote in a note that Ethereum treasuries are facing challenges such as liquidity constraints and smart contract risks that differ from Bitcoin treasury models. The company argued that Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism allows the firms to stake assets for yield, but Bitcoin’s proof-of-work structure allows entities to hold BTC without staking. Ethereum Treasuries emerge as next evolution of Strategy’s playbook Bernstein noted that Ethereum treasuries are also attempting to address limitations on how they deploy capital. According to the report, the treasuries’ staking contracts are liquid, but often wait for days in the queue to unstake. The analyst argued that ETH treasuries need to balance Ethereum liquidity and yield optimization as they stake the digital asset for yield. The brokerage firm added that yield optimization techniques such as the Eigenlayer staking model and DeFi-based yield generation require smart contract security risk management. “The ETH treasury model has the benefit of actual cash flow yield driving operating earnings, however liquidity risk and security would be important considerations.” -Bernstein. The report also noted that companies, including SharpLing Gaming (SBET), Bit Digital (BTBT), and BitMine Immersion (BMNR), are focusing on building Ethereum treasuries. According to Bernstein, the trio had accumulated around 876,000 ETH in July, which accounts for 0.9% of the total supply. BMNR revealed last week that it surpassed $2 billion in its ETH holdings. The firm also announced that it’s aiming to hold and stake around 5% of the total Ethereum supply. Bernstein believes that the growth of the digital dollar and tokenized assets will drive higher user growth in the Ethereum ecosystem. The firm argued that ETH’s transaction volume on layer-2 chains, operated by platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood, will help Ethereum accrue value from the growth of the asset’s financial economy. At the time of publication, the digital currency is currently exchanging hands for around $3,809, a 56.42% rise in the last 30 days. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes has predicted that ETH will surpass its previous record high of $4,800 this year and reach $10,000 by the end of 2025. BitMine Immersion Chair Tom Lee also predicted that the digital asset could hit $60,000, almost 18 times its current value. The equity research firm also argued that Ethereum treasuries have mirrored Strategy’s model, which shifted its focus from software development to purchasing Bitcoin in 2020. The firm now holds around $72 billion in BTC, but Bernstein believes ETH treasuries could have a more involved risk management strategy compared to Strategy’s model. DAOs face centralization risks The brokerage company cautioned that Ethereum treasuries also face centralization risks, particularly in governance token distribution and control. The firm argued that treasury platforms such as Karpatkey, Llama, and Avantgarde are controlled by core contributors, which raises concerns over accountability due to the large sums of public capital they manage. According to the firm, DAO’s internal legal framework makes it hard to identify the responsible party for asset mismanagement. The equity research company believes that, as much as treasury protocols offer undisputed composability, there’s a void in scaling in a decentralized and compliant manner. Bernstein acknowledged that ETH treasuries are unregulated asset managers, warning that a lack of a clear legal framework would expose them to enforcement action or internal governance breakdowns. The brokerage firm still believes the treasuries will grow as DAOs adapt to financing parameters. The company also hopes that the category will mature as the regulatory environment begins to incorporate clearer standards for decentralized entities.

Is U.S. Demand for Bitcoin Collapsing? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market is on high alert today after new data from CryptoQuant shows that the Coinbase Premium Gap for Bitcoin has turned negative for the first time in two months. This important metric may be signaling that buying demand in the United States is growing weaker, which could put more pressure on Bitcoin in the short term. Coinbase’s Bitcoin Premium Turns Negative For the past 60 days, Bitcoin has been trading at a higher price on Coinbase compared to Binance. This usually signals strong buying interest from U.S.-based investors, especially big institutions. Coinbase is preferred in the U.S. due to its regulatory trust and cleaner reputation. But now, for the first time since late May, this premium has flipped. Bitcoin is cheaper on Coinbase than on Binance. Meanwhile, this flip suggests that U.S. demand has slowed down, especially from big institutions that usually use Coinbase to trade. If this trend continues, Bitcoin might drop further. Analysts believe prices could retest support levels between $118,000 and $116,000 CryptoQuant: Weak U.S. Demand Could Pressure Prices Experts at CryptoQuant warn that this drop in U.S. interest might lead to short-term price pressure. In the past, similar negative shifts were linked to U.S. traders becoming cautious. Adding to this concern, Bitcoin ETF inflows have also slowed down in recent weeks, further showing that investor interest from the U.S. might be cooling off, at least for now. Ethereum Coinbase Premium Turn Neutral On the other hand, CryptoQuant’s data also highlights that the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Gap is now neutral, which also means US investors are no longer eager buyers. The shift indicator shows that the Ethereum price will slide toward $3,750 to $3,800. But if the premium gap turns positive again soon, it could be a sign that US buyers are returning, which might help push prices back up.

2025-07-29 08:30:02+00:00,"A Matter Of Time? US May Start Buying Bitcoin Soon, Says Anthony Pompliano","On Monday, Anthony Pompliano, founder and CEO of Professional Capital Management, discussed the state of the crypto market, Wall Street’s growing interest and adoption of Bitcoin (BTC), and some of the events to look forward to. Wall Street’s Eyes On Bitcoin In an interview with CNBC’s Squawk Box, Anthony Pompliano praised the flagship cryptocurrency, affirming that Bitcoin has established itself as the “king of the market,” which won’t change anytime soon. The CEO asserted that most of Wall Street’s time and attention is on BTC, as it has “kind of broken away,” while other assets, like Ethereum, have yet to set a new all-time high (ATH) this cycle. He explained that BTC’s current leading status “doesn’t mean that some of these other assets, maybe, in the future, can’t do that,” but noted that BTC continues to dominate the market in market capitalization, capital flow, and attention. Pompliano highlighted that over the past five to seven years, BTC has gone from “a contrarian trade to a consensus trade,” where everyone is convinced that the leading cryptocurrency will be “around for a long time.” Therefore, “Wall Street, who really was kind of ignoring it or trying to stiff-arm Bitcoin, has now said, wait a second, let’s open up the doors and let’s embrace this thing because they figured out how to make money.” He noted that the flagship crypto has been “put into Wall Street wrappers,” like spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), public companies, and real estate funds, which is a trend that will likely continue in the future as it will bring more customers and more profits for these institutions. I think you’re going to continue to see Wall Street take Bitcoin and put it in every single corner of the traditional financial system, because ultimately, Bitcoin brings volatility. Bitcoin brings financial return in a way that they’re not used to seeing. BTC’s Next Big Thing When asked about the “next big thing” for Bitcoin, Pompliano stated that there are some key factors that people will be paying attention to in the future. One of them will be the US government’s potential announcement of a BTC purchase. “The United States government at some point is going to announce that they’re buying bitcoin,” he affirmed. The CEO explained that creating the initial Strategic BTC Reserve (SBR) with the assets that the government already had “was good,” but was never “the main dish.” To him, “the main dish” will be the US government buying BTC, which he thinks “will happen at some point.” Notably, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on March 6 to officially create a Strategic BTC Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, funded by crypto seized from government criminal and civil forfeiture proceedings. Since then, the government has been exploring “budget-neutral” mechanisms to acquire the flagship crypto. In March, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, originally introduced on July 31, 2024, to establish “a strategic Bitcoin reserve to serve as an additional store of value to bolster America’s balance sheet and ensure the transparent management of Bitcoin holdings of the federal government.” The bill aims to implement a BTC Purchase Program to buy around 5% of the total BTC supply, or 1 million BTC, over 5 years, mirroring the “size and scope” of the US gold reserves. The legislation proposes a hold period of at least 20 years for the BTC acquired under the purchase program. Pompliano also named Wall Street’s “white flag” moment as another event that investors will look forward to. He forecasted that one of the things we are “going to see is some of the last standing people on Wall Street capitulate,” with a couple of firms continuing to say that BTC is speculative, before they “eventually give up and wave the white flag,” he concluded.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/a-matter-of-time-us-may-start-buying-bitcoin-soon/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA,Crypto News|Anthony Pompliano|bitcoin|BITCOIN Act|bitcoin ETFs|Bitcoin Reserve Asset Trump|btc|BTCUSDT|Crypto Market|Digital Asset Stockpile|US President Donald Trump|US Strageic Bitcoin Reserve|wall street bitcoin,BTC,"A Matter Of Time?

In March, Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis reintroduced the Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, originally introduced on July 31, 2024, to establish “a strategic Bitcoin reserve to serve as an additional store of value to bolster America’s balance sheet and ensure the transparent management of Bitcoin holdings of the federal government.” The bill aims to implement a BTC Purchase Program to buy around 5% of the total BTC supply, or 1 million BTC, over 5 years, mirroring the “size and scope” of the US gold reserves. The legislation proposes a hold period of at least 20 years for the BTC acquired under the purchase program. Pompliano also named Wall Street’s “white flag” moment as another event that investors will look forward to. He forecasted that one of the things we are “going to see is some of the last standing people on Wall Street capitulate,” with a couple of firms continuing to say that BTC is speculative, before they “eventually give up and wave the white flag,” he concluded."

2025-07-29 08:55:11+00:00,Altseason Unleashed: Why Bitcoin Dominance Signals Explosive Gains for Altcoins,"BitcoinWorld Altseason Unleashed: Why Bitcoin Dominance Signals Explosive Gains for Altcoins The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation, and for good reason. Whispers of an impending Altseason are growing louder, fueled by significant shifts in Bitcoin’s market dynamics. If you’ve been following the crypto space, you know that when Bitcoin (BTC) makes a move, the rest of the market often follows. But what happens when Bitcoin’s grip on the market loosens? That’s precisely what analysts are observing, and it could unlock a period of extraordinary growth for altcoins. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and the Dawn of Altseason Bitcoin dominance, or BTCD, is a metric that tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Historically, a rising Bitcoin dominance often means capital is flowing into BTC, sometimes at the expense of altcoins. Conversely, a falling dominance suggests that money is rotating out of Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies, paving the way for an Altseason . According to BeInCrypto, a notable shift has occurred: Bitcoin’s market-share index has slid a significant 6.3% in just one month. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a critical indicator that has formed a bearish cross on the three-week chart and, even more notably, broken a three-year uptrend line. These technical signals are not to be ignored, as they often precede major market movements. What Do These Signals Mean for the Crypto Market? Bearish Cross Formation: This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, often signaling a downtrend for the asset (in this case, Bitcoin’s dominance). Break of a Three-Year Uptrend Line: A long-standing trend line breaking suggests a significant change in market structure, indicating a potential reversal of the previous trend. For Bitcoin dominance, this means a sustained move downwards. Capital Rotation: When Bitcoin dominance falls, it typically means investors are taking profits from BTC and reallocating them into altcoins, seeking higher potential returns. Why Are Analysts Predicting an Impending Altseason ? The sentiment among experts is clear. Ash Crypto, a prominent analyst, highlighted these bearish signals for Bitcoin dominance as direct harbingers of an Altseason . This isn’t just speculative talk; it’s based on historical market cycles where similar patterns have led to substantial rallies in altcoin valuations. Trader Ted further reinforced this view, acknowledging that while short-term pullbacks might occur to “shake out weak hands,” the broader outlook for Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins is overwhelmingly positive. He anticipates strong gains over the next three to six months. This period aligns with typical market cycles where capital flows from the dominant asset (Bitcoin) into the broader altcoin market once Bitcoin has established a strong foundation or experienced significant gains. The Role of Ethereum in the Next Altseason Ethereum (ETH), often considered the bellwether for the altcoin market, is expected to lead the charge. As the largest smart contract platform, Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand with innovations in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Layer-2 scaling solutions. Its strong fundamentals and upcoming upgrades make it a prime candidate for significant appreciation during an Altseason . When Ethereum gains momentum, it often pulls the entire altcoin market with it. Many altcoins are built on the Ethereum blockchain or are closely tied to its ecosystem, meaning ETH’s performance can have a ripple effect across hundreds of other projects. Navigating the Opportunities: Which Altcoins Could Thrive? While Ethereum is a strong contender, an Altseason typically sees a broad range of altcoins experience parabolic growth. Investors should look beyond just the top few and consider various sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Here are a few areas that often perform well during these periods: Category Description & Potential Examples (Illustrative) Layer-1 Blockchains Alternative foundational networks competing with Ethereum, offering scalability or unique features. Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) Layer-2 Scaling Solutions Protocols built on top of Layer-1s (like Ethereum) to improve transaction speed and reduce costs. Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Polygon (MATIC) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols offering financial services without intermediaries (lending, borrowing, trading).

BitcoinWorld Altseason Unleashed: Why Bitcoin Dominance Signals Explosive Gains for Altcoins The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation, and for good reason. Whispers of an impending Altseason are growing louder, fueled by significant shifts in Bitcoin’s market dynamics. If you’ve been following the crypto space, you know that when Bitcoin (BTC) makes a move, the rest of the market often follows. But what happens when Bitcoin’s grip on the market loosens? That’s precisely what analysts are observing, and it could unlock a period of extraordinary growth for altcoins. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and the Dawn of Altseason Bitcoin dominance, or BTCD, is a metric that tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. Historically, a rising Bitcoin dominance often means capital is flowing into BTC, sometimes at the expense of altcoins. Conversely, a falling dominance suggests that money is rotating out of Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies, paving the way for an Altseason . According to BeInCrypto, a notable shift has occurred: Bitcoin’s market-share index has slid a significant 6.3% in just one month. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; it’s a critical indicator that has formed a bearish cross on the three-week chart and, even more notably, broken a three-year uptrend line. These technical signals are not to be ignored, as they often precede major market movements. What Do These Signals Mean for the Crypto Market? Bearish Cross Formation: This occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average, often signaling a downtrend for the asset (in this case, Bitcoin’s dominance). Break of a Three-Year Uptrend Line: A long-standing trend line breaking suggests a significant change in market structure, indicating a potential reversal of the previous trend. For Bitcoin dominance, this means a sustained move downwards. Capital Rotation: When Bitcoin dominance falls, it typically means investors are taking profits from BTC and reallocating them into altcoins, seeking higher potential returns. Why Are Analysts Predicting an Impending Altseason ? The sentiment among experts is clear. Ash Crypto, a prominent analyst, highlighted these bearish signals for Bitcoin dominance as direct harbingers of an Altseason . This isn’t just speculative talk; it’s based on historical market cycles where similar patterns have led to substantial rallies in altcoin valuations. Trader Ted further reinforced this view, acknowledging that while short-term pullbacks might occur to “shake out weak hands,” the broader outlook for Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoins is overwhelmingly positive. He anticipates strong gains over the next three to six months. This period aligns with typical market cycles where capital flows from the dominant asset (Bitcoin) into the broader altcoin market once Bitcoin has established a strong foundation or experienced significant gains. The Role of Ethereum in the Next Altseason Ethereum (ETH), often considered the bellwether for the altcoin market, is expected to lead the charge. As the largest smart contract platform, Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to expand with innovations in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and Layer-2 scaling solutions. Its strong fundamentals and upcoming upgrades make it a prime candidate for significant appreciation during an Altseason . When Ethereum gains momentum, it often pulls the entire altcoin market with it. Many altcoins are built on the Ethereum blockchain or are closely tied to its ecosystem, meaning ETH’s performance can have a ripple effect across hundreds of other projects. Navigating the Opportunities: Which Altcoins Could Thrive? While Ethereum is a strong contender, an Altseason typically sees a broad range of altcoins experience parabolic growth. Investors should look beyond just the top few and consider various sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Here are a few areas that often perform well during these periods: Category Description & Potential Examples (Illustrative) Layer-1 Blockchains Alternative foundational networks competing with Ethereum, offering scalability or unique features. Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Cardano (ADA) Layer-2 Scaling Solutions Protocols built on top of Layer-1s (like Ethereum) to improve transaction speed and reduce costs. Arbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), Polygon (MATIC) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols offering financial services without intermediaries (lending, borrowing, trading). Uniswap (UNI), Aave (AAVE), Chainlink (LINK) Gaming & Metaverse Projects integrating blockchain into gaming, virtual worlds, and digital ownership.

2025-07-29 09:00:08+00:00,"Expect A New Bitcoin Price Rally: Analyst Connects M2 Lag To $130,000 Target","As the Bitcoin price hovers just 4% below its all-time high of $123,000, crypto analyst Doctor Profit has issued a new report that could spark increased bullish sentiment among investors, suggesting that a new rally could be on the horizon. Bitcoin Price Poised For Growth After Major Trade Deal In a recent post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Doctor Profit highlighted a significant technical development for the Bitcoin price, noting that the cryptocurrency has recently broken through a diagonal resistance line on its monthly chart—a barrier that had proven insurmountable for several months. According to the analyst, the Bitcoin price faced repeated rejections at this crucial resistance level from November 2024 through February 2025. However, this month marked a decisive breakout for the cryptocurrency, followed by a successful retest of the $114,000 level last Friday and a “strong bullish impulse” forming. Related Reading: Memecoins, NFTs Get Called Out By Their Own Architect: ‘Zero Intrinsic Value’ Doctor Profit emphasized that this breakthrough signals a potential upward movement, asserting that the market is primed for the next leg up. He even predicts that the “bullish chart” will soon dominate discussions across social media. Adding to this optimism are recent developments surrounding a US-Europe trade deal announced on Monday by the White House. Doctor Profit noted that tariffs have been a lingering concern for both the Bitcoin price and the broader stock market, suppressing momentum. However, the analyst asserts that the announcement of a new trade agreement—valued at $750 billion in US energy exports and $600 billion in EU investments—has alleviated some of that pressure. Links Between M2 Money Supply And BTC’s Potential On a macroeconomic level, Doctor Profit highlighted the M2 money supply as a crucial factor influencing the Bitcoin price trajectory. Following a 25% expansion of M2 in 2020 due to pandemic-related measures, Bitcoin experienced an 800% rally. Currently, M2 has increased by 2.3% since the beginning of 2025, despite ongoing quantitative tightening measures by the Federal Reserve (Fed). The analyst believes that this indicates that the Fed may be poised to adopt more aggressive monetary policies in the near future. Related Reading: Ethereum Is About To Breakout Of Massive Consolidation Toward $5,000 Historical data suggests a correlation between increases in M2 and Bitcoin price movements, with the analyst estimating a potential upside of 30-35% for Bitcoin with every 1% increase in M2. The most significant expansion has occurred in recent months, particularly between May and June 2025, when M2 saw a monthly increase of 0.63%. Given Bitcoin’s typical lag in response to M2 changes—approximately 60 to 90 days—there is speculation that this could lead to a 15-17.5% rally in the coming weeks, positioning Bitcoin toward the $130,000 mark. Looking ahead, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is slated for Wednesday, with a strong expectation of no interest rate cuts. As of this writing, the market’s leading cryptocurrency trades at $117,569, up nearly 71% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis.

US law enforcement seizes $31M in cryptocurrency linked to the 2021 Uranium Finance exploit, according to SDNY @SDNYnews . #UraniumFinance #DeFiHacks https://t.co/mnHFNg0AYn — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 25, 2025 The recovery followed coordinated efforts with Homeland Security Investigations to trace funds laundered through Tornado Cash mixers and cross-chain bridges. Similarly, in May, federal prosecutors charged Rustam Gallyamov, a Russian national accused of developing Qakbot malware since 2008, with seizing over $24 million in Bitcoin and stablecoins . The malware infected thousands of computers worldwide, creating botnets used for ransomware deployment by groups including REvil, Conti, and Black Basta. Most recently, the BidenCash dark web marketplace generated $17 million in revenue by selling over 15 million stolen credit cards before authorities seized 145 associated domains. The operation led by the US Secret Service and the FBI involved international partners, including the Dutch National Police. International cooperation has expanded enforcement reach, with authorities in nine countries participating in major takedowns.

Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Plans Transform Seized Asset Policy President Trump’s executive order establishing a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has fundamentally altered the government’s approach to seized cryptocurrency assets. The reserve will utilize approximately 200,000 Bitcoin previously confiscated through law enforcement operations rather than selling assets at auction. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan argues the reserve eliminates the final existential threat to Bitcoin by removing fears of government prohibition. @BitwiseInvest CIO @Matt_Hougan believes @realDonaldTrump ''s executive order to establish a Bitc"

2025-07-29 09:14:59+00:00,DOJ pursues $2.3M in Bitcoin recovered from a suspected ‘Chaos’ ransomware operator,"Federal prosecutors have launched a forfeiture action to claim $2.3 million in Bitcoin allegedly tied to a ransomware actor from the newly identified Chaos group. According to a July 28 press release from the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, the Department of Justice filed a civil complaint seeking the forfeiture of approximately 20.3 Bitcoin. The FBI’s Dallas Division originally seized the Bitcoin in question in mid-April from a wallet linked to an individual known as “Hors,” who is alleged to be a member of the Chaos ransomware group. Authorities claim the funds are connected to schemes that targeted victims in the Northern District of Texas and other regions, and constitute property involved in or derived from “unlawful activity, including money laundering and extortion” related to ransomware attacks. Law enforcement reportedly accessed the wallet using a recovery seed phrase associated with Electrum, an older Bitcoin wallet platform. However, the government has not disclosed how the seed phrase was obtained. According to court documents, federal agents successfully transferred the seized funds to a government-controlled address. At the time of the seizure in April, the Bitcoin was worth approximately $1.7 million. By the time the complaint was filed in late July, the value had increased to over $2.4 million. New entrant in the ransomware market Chaos is a newly identified ransomware-as-a-service operation that has been active since at least February 2025. The group was first documented by cybersecurity firm Cisco Talos, which has warned of its cross-platform capabilities that allow it to target systems running Windows, Linux, ESXi, and NAS systems. Like other RaaS models, Chaos licenses its malware to affiliates in exchange for a share of the ransom payments. Victims are typically pressured into paying in cryptocurrency to regain access to encrypted files or to prevent the public release of stolen data. Despite sharing its name with a well-known ransomware builder, Chaos appears to be a separate group entirely. Researchers believe the threat actors behind the ransomware campaign may be intentionally leveraging the name to obscure attribution and make tracking efforts more difficult. The alias “Hors” is believed to represent one of several active participants using the Chaos platform. A busy month for the DOJ Earlier this month, the DOJ filed a similar civil forfeiture action to recover more than $7 million in cryptocurrency seized by Homeland Security as part of an investigation into a $97 million oil and gas investment scam. The funds were allegedly laundered through wallets linked to suspects in Russia and Nigeria and routed through offshore exchanges. Also in July, the DOJ disclosed that it had collaborated with Tether to recover $40,300 in USDT linked to a phishing scam that impersonated the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee.

Pseudonymous analyst Rekt Capital tells his 553,600 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin needed a weekly candle close above $119,200 to trigger a breakout from a bullish continuation pattern. With BTC closing the previous week at around $119,400, the analyst says Bitcoin is now in the process of flipping the resistance level into support and that breakout rallies are in sight. “Bitcoin did it. Bitcoin Weekly Closed above the ~$119,200 Bull Flag Top and is now in the process of retesting it to fully confirm the breakout. Downside wicking is possible on this retest, as long as the Bull Flag Top is maintained as support.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $118,183. Another crypto asset that had a strong weekly close is the memecoin Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ), according to the trader. While Rekt says the altcoin looks strong, he notes that it needs to flash signs of sustained momentum to invalidate a bearish divergence on the daily chart. A bearish divergence is a reversal signal, suggesting that momentum is waning for an asset after a move up. “Pudgy Penguins has performed its highest ever Weekly Close, doing so above its final major Weekly resistance (blue). Retesting the $0.04 old resistance (blue) into new support would confirm a successful post-breakout retest. While the positioning is favourable, there are mounting Bearish Divergences on the Daily that PENGU will need to soon invalidate for stronger bull bias.” Source: Rekt Capital/X At time of writing, PENGU is worth $0.041.

Here Are the Details,"Joe Lubin, one of the founders of Ethereum, announced that SharpLink Gaming, which he leads, aims to accumulate Ethereum (ETH) as quickly as possible. SharpLink''s Joe Lubin: “We Will Be the Fastest to Collect Ethereum” With this aggressive strategy, the company aims to get ahead of its competitors in the race for institutional Ethereum treasury. Lubin said in an interview: “In terms of fully diluted Ethereum per share accumulation, we will be the fastest progressing among Ethereum-focused projects, and even Bitcoin-focused ones if we include them.” SharpLink Gaming is growing its Ethereum reserves by raising capital daily through at-the-market financing methods. The company also invests its existing ETH holdings through staking, aiming to multiply its position by reinvesting these returns. Joe Lubin is also known as the CEO of Ethereum infrastructure company ConsenSys and one of the eight founding members of Ethereum. SharpLink currently sits in second place with 360,800 ETH (approximately $1.35 billion). Tom Lee''s BitMine Immersion Technologies holds the top spot, which holds 566,800 ETH (approximately $2.13 billion). Other names in the top five for ETH holdings include the Ethereum Foundation, The Ether Machine, and PulseChain. Larger players like Coinbase, Bit Digital, and the Golem Foundation also hold over 100,000 ETH. The race to accumulate ETH is believed to be putting upward pressure on Ethereum''s price. Behind assets like Bitcoin and Solana, ETH has surged 110% to $3,800 in the last three months. Most of its competitors have had to settle for double-digit gains during the same period. Crypto security analyst Wilson Ye stated the following in a post on social media platform X: “What we''re seeing is institutional-scale FOMO (fear of missing out). Large players are racing to gain dominant positions ahead of ETF approvals. This competition validates the thesis that ETH is becoming institutional infrastructure.” SharpLink states that it will adopt a cautious approach to leverage. The company currently has no debt, but is reportedly evaluating new financing options such as issuing convertible bonds. This was a strategy MicroStrategy frequently used in its Bitcoin holdings. Joe Lubin added the following on the subject: “Whatever we do, we will carefully manage risk levels. We will always keep leverage under control.” Lubin stated that this cautious approach will provide significant benefits to shareholders in the long run.

2025-07-29 09:48:00+00:00,Bitcoin (BTC) Breakout Looms: Is a Massive Surge Coming Soon?,"The Bitcoin price is approaching the top of its bull flag once again. Will there be a definitive breakout? If the breakout is weak, or if it fails to happen, could this be the beginning of the end for this current bull market cycle? A changing Bitcoin cycle? If Bitcoin is to make this current bull market cycle one of the more successful ones, the price is going to need to break out soon. On the other hand, some analysts believe that the typical 4-year cycle is changing, and that the sheer amount of institutional money entering the Bitcoin space will push the end of the cycle out to Q1 or Q2 of 2026. If this is going to be the case, the Bitcoin price would have plenty of time for more consolidation before heading into the final phase. However, if we are still in the 4-year cycle, the clock is starting to run down, with only three or four months left before a potential blow-off top at some time in November perhaps? A huge turnaround in the U.S. stock market Source: TradingView On the macro side of things there are positives for Bitcoin. Recent huge trade deals have been agreed with Japan and the EU, which have led to renewed optimism in the U.S. stock market. The chart above of the S&P 500 shows the most incredible turn around from the depths of pessimism over the Trump tariffs, to the record-breaking surge that is currently being experienced. It’s in this kind of environment that Bitcoin can generally be expected to surge. Therefore, it is possibly just a matter of time before Bitcoin embarks on another strong rally to the upside. Shallow rejection for $BTC? Source: TradingView The short-term price chart for $BTC reveals that the price was rejected at the top of the bull flag once again. However, the correctional impulse has so far been rather shallow, only descending as far as the important $118,000 horizontal support. From there, the price has bounced back and is once more flirting with the upper trendline of the bull flag. Will there be a breakout from here? It is entirely possible. All shorter term Stochastic RSI indicators have a way to go before reaching their tops, so momentum is still with the $BTC price. Flag or ascending triangle? Source: TradingView As one zooms further out into the daily time frame, the bull flag becomes less reliable as a pattern, with candle wicks rather than candle bodies unsatisfactorily forming some of the touch points. Therefore, there is the possibility of other patterns becoming valid. The chart above shows an ascending triangle pattern, which keeps the touch points to the candle bodies. If this is a valid pattern, it would be a very bullish one. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators now angled back to the upside. This would also tend to suggest that positive price action is likely to follow. Probabilities of more upside price action Source: TradingView The weekly time frame illustrates that whatever the candle pattern is, it does have the sideways movement of a continuation formation. Also, given that this pattern is smaller than previous ones, it is far more likely to break out sooner. Moving down the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has the indicator lines shaping to cross back down, while at the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator line may have a bullish bounce from the ascending yellow moving average line. Predicting price movements is a very uncertain art. All the price action and indicators can do is to give hints on probabilities of future price direction. Fundamentally, it does look as though the direction for Bitcoin should be up, but technically this is still uncertain. That said, the probability is of more upward price action rather than downside.

A huge turnaround in the U.S. stock market Source: TradingView On the macro side of things there are positives for Bitcoin. Recent huge trade deals have been agreed with Japan and the EU, which have led to renewed optimism in the U.S. stock market. The chart above of the S&P 500 shows the most incredible turn around from the depths of pessimism over the Trump tariffs, to the record-breaking surge that is currently being experienced. It’s in this kind of environment that Bitcoin can generally be expected to surge. Therefore, it is possibly just a matter of time before Bitcoin embarks on another strong rally to the upside. Shallow rejection for $BTC? Source: TradingView The short-term price chart for $BTC reveals that the price was rejected at the top of the bull flag once again. However, the correctional impulse has so far been rather shallow, only descending as far as the important $118,000 horizontal support. From there, the price has bounced back and is once more flirting with the upper trendline of the bull flag. Will there be a breakout from here? It is entirely possible. All shorter term Stochastic RSI indicators have a way to go before reaching their tops, so momentum is still with the $BTC price. Flag or ascending triangle? Source: TradingView As one zooms further out into the daily time frame, the bull flag becomes less reliable as a pattern, with candle wicks rather than candle bodies unsatisfactorily forming some of the touch points. Therefore, there is the possibility of other patterns becoming valid. The chart above shows an ascending triangle pattern, which keeps the touch points to the candle bodies. If this is a valid pattern, it would be a very bullish one. The Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart has the indicators now angled back to the upside. This would also tend to suggest that positive price action is likely to follow. Probabilities of more upside price action Source: TradingView The weekly time frame illustrates that whatever the candle pattern is, it does have the sideways movement of a continuation formation. Also, given that this pattern is smaller than previous ones, it is far more likely to break out sooner. Moving down the chart, the Stochastic RSI on this time frame has the indicator lines shaping to cross back down, while at the bottom of the chart, the RSI indicator line may have a bullish bounce from the ascending yellow moving average line. Predicting price movements is a very uncertain art. All the price action and indicators can do is to give hints on probabilities of future price direction. Fundamentally, it does look as though the direction for Bitcoin should be up, but technically this is still uncertain. That said, the probability is of more upward price action rather than downside.

Production is expected to begin in early 2026, with hiring already underway for 250 local workers. The move comes roughly a year after President Donald Trump called for all remaining bitcoin to be “made in the U.S. ” Bitmain has long dominated the market for specialized cryptocurrency mining hardware. That dominance has been threatened by growing U.S. scrutiny of Chinese tech firms and supply disruptions triggered by escalating trade tensions and tariff threats. Opening a U.S. plant could speed up deliveries and repairs for customers in the country, Gao said, adding that while labor costs are higher, the move still makes commercial sense. Heightened scrutiny from U.S. Customs and Border Protection has delayed mining equipment shipments, and the U.S. Commerce Department has blacklisted Sophgo, an artificial intelligence firm linked to Bitmain, accusing it of “acting at the behest of Beijing to further the PRC’s goals of indigenous advanced chip production,” referring to the People''s Republic of China. Bitcoin mining was historically dominant in China given the low energy costs miners could leverage in the country. After the practice was banned there in 2021 , the U.S. became a prominent crypto mining hub, with American crypto miners like MARA Holdings (MARA) and CleanSpark (CLSK) now being publicly traded. Still, Bitmain’s U.S. move faces obstacles, including regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty over whether crypto hardware like ASIC miners will be subject to the same export rules as AI chips.

This continues despite the meme coin being unable to reclaim its $0.7 all-time high from 2021. Nevertheless, it has not deterred the bulls from predicting that $1 is inevitable this cycle, as many analysts have even predicted that it will jump higher than this by the time the bull run is over. Why Dogecoin Can Rise To $10 Crypto analyst XForceGlobal recently published an analysis showing the Dogecoin price path and where the meme coin could be headed from here. Unlike some who believe that the bull run is over for the meme coin, XForceGlobal predicts that it is destined to rise higher from its current level. The analysis came with both a conservative point of view and a much more ambitious forecast that could see the Dogecoin price hit double-digits . Going with the more conservative prediction, the crypto analyst predicts that Dogecoin could see an initial rise to the $0.65 level, followed by a decline, before rising above the $1 level. Thus, in this scenario, the crypto analyst believes that Dogecoin has the opportunity to rally at 2x-3x before the wave is over. Then moving on to the more ambitious target , the analyst shows an at least 5x surge that will first push its price above the coveted $1 level. However, it will not end there. In a total of five waves, the Elliot Wave certified analyst puts the Dogecoin price above $10, expecting it to reach as high as $16 if this plays out as expected. As to why Dogecoin could see such an insane rally, the crypto analyst explains that DOGE has proven to be a resilient legacy coin. In a market where there are thousands of altcoins, XForceGlobal explains that while the altcoins will rise, finding those like Dogecoin that have the opportunity to rise higher is the most important. Analysts Are Bullish On DOGE Another crypto analyst who has predicted that the Dogecoin price could cross the $10 level is DOGECAPITAL. According to a report from NewsBTC , the analyst believes that if the DOGE price does follow the previous cycles using the Fibonacci tool, then the meme coin is destined to cross $10. Additionally, crypto analyst Dima James Potts has been one of the most vocal voices for Dogecoin price reaching the $10 level. This call has been made by the analyst months ago, and like DOGECAPITAL, he points to the historical performance of Dogecoin to forecast why its price could beat $10 this time.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-eyes-rise-to-10/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA,Dogecoin|crypto|crypto news|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,BTC,"Forget $1: Dogecoin Eyes Rise To $10 If It Follows This Path.

2025-07-29 10:00:55+00:00,"Bitcoin Is A Lifeline, Says Billionaire, As US Faces Debt Time Bomb","Ray Dalio, the billionaire behind Bridgewater Associates, says people should think about putting 15% of their money into gold or Bitcoin. His call comes as America’s debt nears the $37 trillion mark. He argues that holding hard assets can help when paper money loses value. Related Reading: Countdown To August 15: What XRP Investors Need To Know “If you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have around 15% of your money in Bitcoin or gold,” Dalio said during the Master Investor podcast this week. Dalio admits he owns only a little Bitcoin and still leans toward gold. But he’s clear that splitting that 15% between the two is up to each investor. Optimizing For A Debt‑Strained Dollar According to Dalio, the US government will need to sell about $12 trillion more in treasuries over the next year to deal with its growing bill. He pointed out that recent Treasury data shows borrowing in the third quarter of 2025 could hit $1 trillion—$453 billion above earlier estimates—and another $590 billion in the fourth quarter. He warns that printing or selling more debt tends to weaken a currency. That’s why gold and Bitcoin, which aren’t tied to any central bank’s balance sheet, can act as buffers against plain old dollars. Balancing Gold And Bitcoin Dalio said gold remains his go‑to choice. It has centuries of track record against inflation and crisis. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is newer and can swing wildly in price. It’s trading around $118,862, roughly 4% below its July 14 all‑time high of $123,250. While its ups and downs can add spice to returns, they can also give some investors sleepless nights. Dalio suggests you pick a mix that feels right. If you hate big price moves, tilt toward gold. If you can stomach Bitcoin’s roller‑coaster, you might give it a bigger slice. Midway Through The Conversation On Risk He raised the idea back in January 2022 with 1% to 2% in Bitcoin. Now he’s tripling that bucket. That jump shows how fast the mood can shift when national debt climbs. Dalio noted that other Western nations like the United Kingdom face the same “debt doom loop” he sees in the US. He said their currencies may lag behind hard assets, making gold and Bitcoin effective diversifiers when government bills keep piling up. Related Reading: Memecoins, NFTs Get Called Out By Their Own Architect: ‘Zero Intrinsic Value’ Role Of Reserve Currencies Despite his nod to Bitcoin, Dalio said it won’t replace the dollar or euro for central banks.

2025-07-29 10:02:40+00:00,Ika Launches Mainnet to Enable Native Cross-Chain Asset Control on Sui Blockchain,"Zug, Switzerland, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire Ika , the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability. At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control. The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework. The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance. Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika’s mainnet, demonstrating the protocol’s versatility and robustness: Native is enhancing Bitcoin liquidity through native lending and DeFi services. Human Tech delivers “Wallet-as-a-Protocol” solutions, seamlessly managing cross-chain assets. Rhei Finance offers institutional-grade zero-trust multi-chain DeFi services. Aeon advances decentralized custody solutions optimized for AI-driven financial management. Nativerse pioneers Bitcoin-backed stablecoins without synthetic or wrapped intermediaries. Ekko integrates AI chatbots with decentralized security via MPC technology. Legacy Link facilitates secure digital asset inheritance through streamlined estate management. Full Sail introduces an advanced Automated Market Maker (AMM) leveraging Ika’s interoperability. “Today marks the start of a new era in blockchain interoperability,” said Ika Co-Founder Omer Sadika. “Our mainnet launch is not just a technological milestone, but a paradigm shift, bringing native Zero-Trust interoperability to Sui , and unlocking unprecedented possibilities for developers, institutions, and individual users alike.” With Ika now live, blockchain projects, financial institutions, and developers can deploy multi-chain applications on Sui, operate as network participants, or engage with the Ika network.

2025-07-29 10:03:00+00:00,"Dogecoin (DOGE) Can Hit $0.50 In August, But Remittix (RTX) Is The Best Crypto To Buy Now For Huge Gains","After a recent retracement from its high in July, Dogecoin (DOGE) is starting to pick up again as crypto analysts predict a bullish shift to $0.50 as a short-term target. But while DOGE speculators are utterly focused on the meme token, which is fueled by perhaps another hype, serious traders and investors are positioning in something better – Remittix (RTX). Let’s talk DOGE first before we explore what Remittix is all about and why it’s a fundamentally stronger project that could do a 10x or more move by year-end. Can DOGE Actually Break $0.50 This Summer? Dogecoin has been on a tear this cycle, with renewed mainstream mentions and listings among top retail platforms, and many are now eyeing $0.50 as a possible milestone by August. Traders point to bullish patterns in Dogecoin’s price on the weekly chart and increasing sentiment on crypto forums and social channels. If Bitcoin breaks out of the current range to the upside and capital rotates into meme coins, DOGE could spike. Still, technical resistance between $0.45 and $0.50 will be challenging if retail enthusiasm fades or meme hype loses steam. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Be the Better Play Now While DOGE rides the meme wave, investors looking for outsized gains are turning to Remittix (RTX), a project built for practical impact, not just social media chatter. Real-world remittance model: Remittix addresses a massive global need: low-cost, near-instant cross-border payments, which the legacy systems have failed to address. Growth-driven tokenomics: Since real-use cases back RTX, its price is expected to be sustainable, thereby driving long-term investor confidence. What’s more, there’s an ongoing $250,000 crypto giveaway. Token success and surging adoption: Remittix has raised over $17.5 million, and adoption continues to widen with new partnership rollouts and a polished user interface. Whales are quietly building positions, and smarter capital is betting on long-term upside, not short-lived hype. Better risk-to-reward profile: DOGE might return 2× from $0.25, but speculative sentiment can fade fast. In contrast, RTX offers potential 10× 50× gains, especially for early stakeholders riding behind tangible product development. Also, Dogecoin wins when it comes to brand recognition and cultural relevance. Elon Musk’s tweets can still send it soaring, and the community is as passionate as ever. But for investors looking for solid fundamentals and actual use cases, Remittix offers far more upside, particularly in a market cycle that’s starting to reward utility over memes. So, if you’re chasing short-term meme gains, Dogecoin price might still move toward $0.50 this summer, with volatility and quick exits in mind. But if you’re looking for longer-term growth paired with real utility, Remittix makes a strong case.

2025-07-29 10:03:16+00:00,Ika Launches Mainnet to Enable Native Cross-Chain Asset Control on Sui Blockchain,"Zug, Switzerland, July 29th, 2025, Chainwire Ika , the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability. At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control. The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework. The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance. Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika’s mainnet, demonstrating the protocol’s versatility and robustness: Native is enhancing Bitcoin liquidity through native lending and DeFi services. Human Tech delivers ""Wallet-as-a-Protocol"" solutions, seamlessly managing cross-chain assets. Rhei Finance offers institutional-grade zero-trust multi-chain DeFi services. Aeon advances decentralized custody solutions optimized for AI-driven financial management. Nativerse pioneers Bitcoin-backed stablecoins without synthetic or wrapped intermediaries. Ekko integrates AI chatbots with decentralized security via MPC technology. Legacy Link facilitates secure digital asset inheritance through streamlined estate management.

July 29th, 2025 – Zug, Switzerland Ika , the pioneering blockchain infrastructure provider, has officially launched its mainnet, marking a significant milestone in blockchain interoperability. The launch introduces the first-ever zero-trust multiparty computation (MPC) network capable of native cross-chain asset control directly from smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. Ika’s protocol allows Sui-based smart contracts to securely and seamlessly manage native assets across many blockchains, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and modern L1s and L2s, without relying on bridges, token wrapping, or trusted third parties. This breakthrough eliminates common risks associated with cross-chain solutions, such as vulnerabilities inherent in bridging protocols or wrapped tokens, fundamentally transforming blockchain interoperability. At the heart of Ika’s innovation is the introduction of dWallets, a decentralized, programmable, and transferable signing mechanism. dWallets enable both the user and the Ika network to collaboratively sign transactions, while enforcing logic governed by smart contracts. This empowers developers and institutions to build and operate securely across various blockchains with native asset control. The technological core of Ika is its novel 2PC-MPC cryptography protocol, previously thought impractical for decentralized environments due to latency, scalability, and security constraints. Ika has overcome these hurdles, delivering sub-second latency and linear scalability, without compromising on decentralization, delivering a network that can be supported by hundreds of operators globally. Each operation includes cryptographic safeguards that require explicit user participation, supporting a zero-trust security framework. The network’s native token, IKA, plays a critical role by securing the infrastructure through a decentralized, permissionless proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. IKA tokens are integral for transaction fees, spam prevention, rewarding reliable operators, and network governance. Several leading blockchain projects on Sui are already utilizing Ika’s mainnet, demonstrating the protocol’s versatility and robustness: Native is enhancing Bitcoin liquidity through native lending and DeFi services. Human Tech delivers “Wallet-as-a-Protocol” solutions, seamlessly managing cross-chain assets. Rhei Finance offers institutional-grade zero-trust multi-chain DeFi services. Aeon advances decentralized custody solutions optimized for AI-driven financial management. Nativerse pioneers Bitcoin-backed stablecoins without synthetic or wrapped intermediaries.

2025-07-29 10:10:11+00:00,Bitcoin Demand: The Crucial Shift as US Investors Await Lower Prices,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Demand: The Crucial Shift as US Investors Await Lower Prices Are you feeling the chill in the crypto air? Recent reports suggest a significant shift in the landscape of Bitcoin demand , particularly among investors in the United States. It appears a ‘wait-and-see’ approach is taking hold, with many anticipating a dip in prices before re-entering the market. This isn’t just a hunch; market indicators are painting a clear picture of this evolving sentiment. Understanding the Current State of Bitcoin Demand According to Arab Chain, a respected contributor at CryptoQuant, the appetite for Bitcoin (BTC) among U.S. investors has noticeably cooled. This observation isn’t just anecdotal; it’s backed by the behavior of key market indicators. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, understanding these shifts in Bitcoin demand is crucial for navigating potential price movements. The primary tool for gauging U.S. investor interest in Bitcoin is the Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index. This index measures the price difference between BTC traded on Coinbase’s USD market and Binance’s USDT market. A positive premium indicates stronger buying pressure from U.S. investors, who typically use Coinbase for their USD-denominated trades. Conversely, a shrinking or negative premium suggests declining U.S. buying interest. The Coinbase Premium Index: A Key Indicator for Bitcoin Demand The Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index has recently experienced a sharp decline. While it remains positive, its significant drop signals a clear change in investor behavior. Let’s break down what this index tells us about Bitcoin demand : Positive Premium: Historically, a strong positive premium has indicated robust U.S. buying pressure, often preceding or accompanying upward price movements. It means U.S. investors are willing to pay a slight premium for Bitcoin. Declining Premium: A sharp drop, even if still positive, suggests that U.S. investors are becoming less aggressive buyers. They are no longer eager to pay a premium, indicating a pause or a re-evaluation of their positions. Negative Premium: If the index were to dip into negative territory, it would signify that U.S. investors are actively selling or are completely disengaged from buying. This typically precedes or accompanies a market correction or prolonged consolidation. Historical Precedent: When U.S. Bitcoin Demand Surged History often provides valuable lessons, and the current situation is no exception. Arab Chain highlighted that U.S. Bitcoin demand historically surged when Bitcoin traded below $105,000. This period saw significant accumulation by U.S. investors, contributing to upward price momentum. What does this tell us? It suggests a psychological threshold or a perceived ‘fair value’ that U.S. investors are comfortable buying at. When prices are above this comfort zone, they tend to hold back, waiting for a more opportune entry point. This pattern underscores the importance of understanding investor psychology in driving market trends. What Drives Investor Caution? Factors Influencing Current Bitcoin Demand Several factors could be contributing to this cautious approach among U.S. investors, influencing overall Bitcoin demand : Factor Impact on Bitcoin Demand Macroeconomic Uncertainty High inflation, interest rate hikes, and recession fears can lead investors to de-risk, reducing speculative investments like crypto. Regulatory Environment Uncertainty or tightening regulations in the U.S. can make investors hesitant, fearing potential restrictions or market disruptions. Profit-Taking & Market Cycles After significant rallies, investors often take profits, leading to temporary dips in demand as they await new entry points. Halving Cycle Dynamics Post-halving, there’s often a period of consolidation before the next major bull run, leading to reduced immediate buying pressure. Geopolitical Tensions Global instability can prompt a flight to safety, but for some, it might mean reducing exposure to volatile assets like crypto. What Happens Next? Potential Scenarios for Bitcoin Demand The current state of Bitcoin demand sets the stage for several potential scenarios. Understanding these can help investors prepare: Continued Consolidation: If the Coinbase Premium Index continues to hover in low positive territory, it could signal a period of sideways trading, where Bitcoin’s price moves within a relatively narrow range. This ‘calm before the storm’ can be frustrating for traders but might offer accumulation opportunities for long-term holders. Market Correction: A move into negative territory for the premium index would strongly suggest a more significant market correction. This would imply U.S. investors are selling off their holdings, potentially leading to a sharper price decline.

2025-07-29 10:34:05+00:00,Ripple v. SEC court case update amid August deadline,"The long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is approaching another deadline, one that could redefine the global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies . Namely, the SEC is required to update the appellate court on the status of the case by August 15, particularly in regard to the appeals that were put on pause to allow the two parties to discuss the matter in private. In a social media post , the former SEC attorney Marc Fagel noted that even though the August date is not a dismissal but rather a procedural update deadline, he still believes we might see the appeals dropped by then. I believe that’s the date for the parties to report on the status of their appeals. It doesn’t mean it’s a hard deadline by which they must file their dismissal papers, but I assume they will try to do so before then. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 28, 2025 Crypto regulation and clarity A court ruling has already clarified that XRP sold to retail investors doesn’t count as a security. Institutional sales, on the other hand, still remain a regulatory gray area. The market thus hopes the Ripple case will provide a hint or two as to what future compliance frameworks might look like. Adding to both optimism and uncertainty is the upcoming BRICS 2025 Summit scheduled for August 9–15 in Kazan, Russia. The summit’s agenda includes discussions on a new BRICS currency or settlement mechanism, a global de-dollarization strategy, and the integration of digital assets and blockchain-based financial infrastructures. The timing has naturally caught the attention of crypto analysts and investors, who wonder whether Ripple’s technology or XRP’s liquidity might reinforce some of the efforts. 3/ 🌍 BRICS 2025 Summit Road Rally: An Economic Power Shift?

SEC court case update amid August deadline. The long-running legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is approaching another deadline, one that could redefine the global regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies . Namely, the SEC is required to update the appellate court on the status of the case by August 15, particularly in regard to the appeals that were put on pause to allow the two parties to discuss the matter in private. In a social media post , the former SEC attorney Marc Fagel noted that even though the August date is not a dismissal but rather a procedural update deadline, he still believes we might see the appeals dropped by then. I believe that’s the date for the parties to report on the status of their appeals. It doesn’t mean it’s a hard deadline by which they must file their dismissal papers, but I assume they will try to do so before then. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 28, 2025 Crypto regulation and clarity A court ruling has already clarified that XRP sold to retail investors doesn’t count as a security. Institutional sales, on the other hand, still remain a regulatory gray area. The market thus hopes the Ripple case will provide a hint or two as to what future compliance frameworks might look like. Adding to both optimism and uncertainty is the upcoming BRICS 2025 Summit scheduled for August 9–15 in Kazan, Russia. The summit’s agenda includes discussions on a new BRICS currency or settlement mechanism, a global de-dollarization strategy, and the integration of digital assets and blockchain-based financial infrastructures. The timing has naturally caught the attention of crypto analysts and investors, who wonder whether Ripple’s technology or XRP’s liquidity might reinforce some of the efforts. 3/ 🌍 BRICS 2025 Summit Road Rally: An Economic Power Shift?

2025-07-29 10:35:16+00:00,Is Institutional Profit-Taking About to Derail Bitcoin’s Rally?,"Long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders appear to be taking profits as prices test the $120,000 mark. This has sparked concerns about whether the actions signal cautious profit-taking or a larger trend. Incoming Correction? On-chain data shared by CryptoQuant shows that LTHs have flipped net negative at this key resistance level. This indicates that some are cashing out after riding previous bull cycles. While overall selling pressure remains moderate, one major player is drawing attention – Galaxy Digital. Reports suggest the firm offloaded around 80,000 BTC, which points to institutional activity rather than retail-driven selling. This raises questions about whether this is a short-term adjustment or the early signs of broader de-risking. CryptoQuant also speculated that such actions could prompt other large holders to follow Galaxy’s lead. While this can simply be prudent profit-taking after a historic rally, either way, investor behavior at these levels may set the tone for Bitcoin’s next move. In yet another concerning trend, CryptoQuant found that US demand for Bitcoin may be cooling after observing signals from the Coinbase Premium Index. The index has recently declined, which indicates that US-based participants are showing less interest in acquiring Bitcoin at current price levels. It is still important to note that the index remains in positive territory, which means that a premium continues, though notably smaller than during previous accumulation phases. This softening contrasts with past patterns where demand surged when Bitcoin traded below $105,000. Such zones previously triggered renewed buying interest from US investors, implying those levels were perceived as favorable entry points. With Bitcoin now trading higher, it seems US investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach and are potentially holding out for lower prices. Historically, US demand has played a crucial role in the crypto asset’s upward momentum. When the premium index rises alongside price, it’s typically a bullish sign. But if the index slips into negative territory, it may reflect a weakening in one of the market’s most influential buyer segments. Liquidity Metrics Paint Strong Bull Case Amid concerns over weakening US demand and long-term holders cashing out, some voices remain confident in Bitcoin’s strength. Vtrader Founder Steve Gregory believes that Bitcoin is poised for another significant move upward following recent positive trade developments and strong market momentum. In a statement to CryptoPotato , Gregory said that the “next move this week is up,” and predicted a climb to $139,000. While he acknowledges the path won’t be a straight line, Gregory added that current momentum feels like “peak cycle gains.” “Bitcoin being an indicator of global liquidity is becoming more of a credible narrative. If the bitcoin price is just a marker of global liquidity via M2 and global liquidity relative to Bitcoin supply has reached a 12-year high, with ~$5.7 million in global M2 supply per Bitcoin in circulation.

2025-07-29 10:35:41+00:00,SEC Postpones Verdict on Trump-Backed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its decision timeline on the proposed Truth Social Bitcoin ETF, shifting the deadline from August 4 to September 18. Backed by Trump Media and Technology Group, the fund seeks to launch on NYSE Arca under the SEC’s commodity-based trust share structure. The regulator said the additional time is necessary to evaluate the proposal thoroughly and consider any feedback from the public or relevant stakeholders. This delay falls within the SEC’s legal window of up to 270 days to approve or deny ETF applications. If greenlit, the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF would be the first crypto-based investment product tied directly to a U.S. president’s business ventures, prompting broader concerns about political and ethical implications. Multiple Crypto ETF Applications Face Delays The Truth Social ETF is not alone in facing regulatory hesitation. On the same day, the SEC also pushed back decisions on two other cryptocurrency-focused funds: Grayscale’s Solana Trust, now delayed until October 10, and Canary Capital’s proposed Litecoin ETF. These delays underline the agency’s cautious approach as it navigates the intersection of traditional finance, digital assets, and political influence. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, often referred to as “Crypto Mom” for her support of digital assets, has repeatedly urged the crypto community to manage expectations around ETF approvals. “People have to be patient,” she said in a May interview with Bloomberg. “We have some ongoing litigation we’re trying to work through. We have lots of other considerations.” Despite recent delays, progress is notably quicker than in the past. The SEC took over a decade to approve the first spot Bitcoin ETF, which was finally greenlit in January 2024. Trump’s Growing Crypto Footprint Raises Red Flags While the SEC has not raised formal objections to the Truth Social ETF, the Trump family’s expanding involvement in crypto has drawn scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers. In May, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley raised ethical concerns in a letter to the Office of Government Ethics, calling a Trump-linked crypto deal involving World Liberty Financial, Binance, and a UAE firm “a staggering conflict of interest.” Critics argue that the former president could personally profit from favorable regulatory decisions, particularly if the Truth Social ETF increases demand for digital assets associated with his brand.

2025-07-29 10:40:11+00:00,Ethereum OI Dominance: A Pivotal Shift in Crypto Speculation,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum OI Dominance: A Pivotal Shift in Crypto Speculation In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptocurrency, discerning subtle shifts in market sentiment and capital flow can provide invaluable insights. Recently, a significant development has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike: Ethereum OI dominance has surged to levels not seen in over a year. This isn’t just a fleeting statistic; it signals a potentially pivotal redirection of speculative capital within the digital asset space, moving notably from Bitcoin towards Ethereum. Understanding the Rise of Ethereum OI Dominance On-chain analytics firm Glassnode recently shared compelling data on X, highlighting that Ethereum’s perpetual futures open interest (OI) dominance climbed to nearly 40%. This figure represents its highest level since April 2023. But what exactly does this mean, and why is it so significant? Let’s break down the core concept: What is Open Interest (OI)? Open Interest refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not been settled. In simpler terms, it’s the total number of open positions in a particular asset’s derivatives market. A higher OI generally indicates increased market participation and liquidity. What is OI Dominance? When we talk about Ethereum OI dominance , we’re referring to Ethereum’s share of the total open interest across all cryptocurrency perpetual futures markets. If Ethereum’s OI dominance is increasing, it means a larger proportion of speculative capital in the derivatives market is being allocated to Ethereum-based contracts compared to other cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin. Why 40% is a Milestone: Reaching nearly 40% dominance signifies a substantial concentration of speculative interest in Ethereum. It suggests that traders are increasingly looking to ETH for potential price movements and leverage opportunities, possibly viewing it as having greater upside potential or more interesting short-term catalysts than Bitcoin at the moment. What’s Fueling This Shift? Unpacking the Reasons Behind Increased Ethereum OI Dominance The movement of speculative capital from one major asset to another is rarely arbitrary. Several factors could be contributing to the notable increase in Ethereum OI dominance : The Bitcoin Halving Aftermath and Market Maturity Bitcoin recently underwent its fourth halving event, a pre-programmed reduction in mining rewards. While historically bullish, the immediate post-halving period can sometimes lead to a ‘sell the news’ reaction or a period of consolidation. Institutional adoption of Bitcoin via spot ETFs has also matured, potentially leading to more stable, less volatile price action compared to its earlier, more speculative phases. As Bitcoin becomes more ‘mainstream’ and its price discovery perhaps less dramatic in the short term, some speculative capital may seek higher volatility and potential returns elsewhere. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Momentum and Upcoming Catalysts Ethereum, on the other hand, continues to be a hotbed of innovation. Its robust ecosystem, encompassing decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a burgeoning layer-2 scaling solution landscape, offers numerous avenues for growth and speculation. Furthermore, the market is keenly watching for potential future developments, such as the ongoing discussions around a spot Ethereum ETF, which, if approved, could unlock a new wave of institutional investment and further boost confidence in ETH. Consider these points: DeFi and L2 Growth: The total value locked (TVL) in Ethereum’s DeFi protocols and the increasing adoption of Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism demonstrate the network’s ongoing utility and expansion. This organic growth provides a fundamental underpinning for speculative interest. Staking Yields: Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake allows for staking, offering yields to holders. This mechanism adds an attractive income-generating component that Bitcoin does not natively possess, potentially drawing in long-term capital that might also dabble in derivatives for hedging or amplified returns. Technological Upgrades: While the Dencun upgrade has passed, the continuous pipeline of technological advancements on Ethereum’s roadmap keeps the network dynamic and forward-looking, attracting attention from traders looking for future catalysts. Implications for Investors: Navigating the New Landscape of Ethereum OI Dominance The rising Ethereum OI dominance has several important implications for investors and traders: Increased Volatility and Liquidity for ETH A higher concentration of open interest typically means increased liquidity in the futures market.

Ethereum and Altcoins Could Outperform Soon Top crypto analyst Miles Deutscher says this pullback is a typical shakeout in what he calls the final phase of the bull cycle. He believes this phase still holds the most explosive upside, especially for Ethereum and altcoins. “Historically, 80% of returns happen in the final 20% of the cycle,” Deutscher noted . Bitcoin has already climbed from $16K to over $120K this cycle, but Ethereum is still catching up. After months of consolidation, ETH recently surged toward $4,000. Capital rotation from Bitcoin to Ethereum is a familiar pattern. As Ethereum gains momentum , altcoins historically follow with even greater volatility. This “catch-up play” often sets the stage for a full-blown altseason, with retail investors and new money flowing in.

He urged traders to share their altcoin picks early, saying this might be the last chance before small investments could turn into life-changing profits. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-29 10:55:10+00:00,Ethereum Price: Standard Chartered’s Bold Prediction for a Monumental Rise to $4K+,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price: Standard Chartered’s Bold Prediction for a Monumental Rise to $4K+ The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a groundbreaking prediction that could redefine the market’s landscape. Standard Chartered, a global banking giant, has put forth a compelling forecast for the Ethereum price , suggesting it could soar past the $4,000 mark. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s rooted in a significant shift in institutional investment patterns, where Ethereum is now reportedly outperforming Bitcoin in terms of fresh capital inflows. What does this mean for the future of digital assets and your portfolio? Unpacking Standard Chartered’s Bold Ethereum Price Forecast Geoff Kendrick, the esteemed head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered, recently shared insights that have sent ripples across the crypto community. According to JinSe Finance, Kendrick believes that the increasing purchases of Ethereum (ETH) by listed companies could be the primary catalyst driving the Ethereum price above $4,000. This projection isn’t arbitrary; it stems from a notable observation: institutional buying of ETH is now reportedly outpacing that of Bitcoin. Why the pivot? Kendrick points to existing restrictions on direct crypto investments, suggesting that these limitations are subtly redirecting significant capital towards Ethereum. This forecast is particularly significant given Standard Chartered’s reputation in traditional finance. Their analysis lends a layer of credibility and seriousness to the potential for Ethereum’s growth, moving it beyond the realm of purely retail-driven speculation. For many, a sustained Ethereum price above $4,000 would not only signify a return to previous highs but also a strong validation of its foundational technology and market position. It highlights a growing confidence among major financial players in Ethereum’s long-term viability and its pivotal role in the evolving digital economy. Why Are Institutional Investors Pivoting to Ethereum (ETH)? The shift in institutional preference from Bitcoin to Ethereum is a fascinating development, signaling a maturing market and evolving investment strategies. While Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of digital gold, Ethereum offers a different value proposition—a programmable blockchain powering a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Several factors contribute to this pivot, influencing the potential trajectory of the Ethereum price : Evolving Regulatory Landscape: As regulators worldwide grapple with direct cryptocurrency investments, some institutions might find Ethereum a more accessible or compliant entry point, especially given its utility-driven nature versus Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative. This nuance in regulatory treatment can subtly redirect capital flows. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s network activity, fueled by its role as the backbone for countless innovative projects, presents a compelling growth story. Institutions are increasingly looking beyond simple asset appreciation to invest in platforms with tangible utility and a robust developer community. Staking Rewards: With Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge and subsequent upgrades like Shanghai), investors can now earn yields by staking their ETH. This passive income opportunity adds an attractive layer for institutional funds seeking consistent returns, potentially influencing their decision to allocate more capital to Ethereum price exposure. Diversification: Smart institutional portfolios always seek diversification. While Bitcoin might represent one facet of crypto exposure, Ethereum offers a complementary and distinct investment thesis, appealing to those looking to broaden their digital asset holdings and mitigate risk. This growing institutional interest acts as a powerful demand driver, creating a positive feedback loop that could significantly impact the Ethereum price trajectory, making it a focal point for future market analysis. The Broader Implications for the Ethereum Ecosystem An influx of institutional capital into Ethereum isn’t just about a rising Ethereum price ; it has profound implications for the entire ecosystem. This increased adoption validates Ethereum’s underlying technology and its critical role in the future of decentralized finance and the broader Web3 landscape. It signals a shift from niche interest to mainstream financial recognition, potentially accelerating the development and acceptance of decentralized technologies. Here’s how institutional inflows could reshape the Ethereum ecosystem: Enhanced Liquidity: More institutional money means deeper liquidity pools, making the market more robust and less susceptible to sudden price swings.

Over the past thirty days, the Ethereum price has surged by an impressive 80%, marking a significant recovery after a long period of consolidation and retest of lower levels that saw minimal bullish activity. Ethereum Price Poised For Breakout While other major digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP have reported gains of 10% and 40%, respectively on the monthly time frame, the recent Ethereum price resurgence is particularly notable. Crypto analyst Lark Davis recently took to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to assert that Ethereum is on the verge of breaking the $4,000 mark, indicating that momentum is building rapidly. Related Reading: TRON Sees $1B USDT Mint: Liquidity Wave Incoming? Despite its recent gains, Ethereum remains approximately 25% shy of its peak from the 2021 cycle. Historically, Bitcoin dominance has played a crucial role in determining the Ethereum price trajectory. The analyst observed that for the Ethereum price to reach its peak, Bitcoin’s dominance needs to dip to around 40%. Currently, Bitcoin’s dominance is in a downtrend at 61%, and the last time it fell to similar levels, ETH rallied over 200%. Another analyst, known as JACKIS on X, has made a bold proclamation that Ethereum will likely never trade below $3,000 again, suggesting that any such decline would indicate a catastrophic failure of the asset. However, JACKIS acknowledges that a temporary correction down to around $3,400 is still plausible given Ethereum’s proximity to the $4,000 threshold. Wall Street Sees $60,000 Implied Value Adding to the bullish sentiment surrounding ETH’s momentum, the network’s potential has been emphasized by BitMine, a company involved in Bitcoin and Ethereum mining. In a recent social media thread, BitMine highlighted that many on Wall Street view Ethereum as the most significant macro trade for the next decade. Tom Lee, the chair of BitMine, referred to stablecoins as the “ChatGPT moment” for the cryptocurrency space, projecting that stablecoin market capitalization could soar to $4 trillion—a tenfold increase. Notably, over 60% of these stablecoins are based on the Ethereum network, boosting demand for the token.

2025-07-29 11:00:37+00:00,Bitcoin Blitz: Bakkt Holdings Gear Up To Finance $1 Billion-Dollar Purchase,"On Monday, crypto software firm Bakkt Holdings (BKKT) announced an ambitious plan to raise up to $1 billion through various securities offerings to boost its own Bitcoin (BTC) treasury reserve, in line with the growing trend among publicly traded companies. This move comes amid rising Bitcoin prices , which are hovering just below all-time highs, and increased interest in the cryptocurrency market, further fueled by a new wave of regulatory developments in the United States. Bakkt’s $1 Billion Offering In its announcement , Bakkt revealed its intention to offer shares of Class A common stock and pre-funded warrants in a public offering. The company plans to provide underwriters with a 30-day option to purchase an additional 15% of the shares sold, allowing for potential over-allotments. The offering is contingent upon market conditions, and there are no guarantees regarding its timing, size, or terms. Bakkt has indicated that the proceeds from this offering will primarily be utilized for purchasing Bitcoin and other digital assets , in line with its investment strategy, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. Clear Street LLC and Cohen & Company Capital Markets are acting as joint book-running managers for this offering, which is being made under a shelf registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month. From Trump Media Talks To Bitcoin Treasury This latest initiative follows a tumultuous period for Bakkt. Last year, the company was on the cusp of an acquisition by Donald Trump’s media venture, Trump Media and Technology Group, which operates the social media platform Truth Social. That announcement resulted in a notable 15% spike in Bakkt’s stock price. However, the anticipated acquisition did not materialize, and Bakkt has since pivoted its focus toward the cryptocurrency market, evidenced by moves like amassing over $2 billion in Bitcoin for its newly established crypto treasury. The company has faced challenges as well; in March 2025, its stock plummeted by 30% after announcing that two major clients, including Bank of America, would not be renewing their financial agreements. In the wake of the recent offering announcement, Bakkt’s shares initially surged by approximately 3%, though they ultimately closed the day down 5% at $17 per share. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,960, marking a 10% surge within the monthly timeframe. Since July 13, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has been attempting to consolidate above the $116,000–$120,000 range. It is currently only 4% below the $123,000 record. However, according to CoinGecko data , there has been a 35% surge in Bitcoin trading volume over the last 24 hours, indicating ongoing interest and demand for the cryptocurrency, which could lead to a new phase of price discovery for BTC.

The company has faced challenges as well; in March 2025, its stock plummeted by 30% after announcing that two major clients, including Bank of America, would not be renewing their financial agreements. In the wake of the recent offering announcement, Bakkt’s shares initially surged by approximately 3%, though they ultimately closed the day down 5% at $17 per share. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $117,960, marking a 10% surge within the monthly timeframe. Since July 13, the market’s leading cryptocurrency has been attempting to consolidate above the $116,000–$120,000 range. It is currently only 4% below the $123,000 record. However, according to CoinGecko data , there has been a 35% surge in Bitcoin trading volume over the last 24 hours, indicating ongoing interest and demand for the cryptocurrency, which could lead to a new phase of price discovery for BTC.
