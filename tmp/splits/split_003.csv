In a new strategy session, Pizzino tells his 353,000 YouTube subscribers that the US dollar is likely to experience “further downside,” a factor that will benefit the price of Bitcoin. “I think this is good news for Bitcoin at this stage of the cycle… I’m counting on the US dollar continuing down. And in this stage of the cycle, where Bitcoin still heading up, I would still count on Bitcoin going up with the weakness in the US dollar.” Pizzino also says the stock market’s current setup, as reflected in the S&P 500 index, is another bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. “Now, we’re seeing further upside with the S&P 500. Yes, it hasn’t hit a new all-time high today, but the trend is very much up. And generally when it breaks out of the consolidation, especially as it runs into a new fresh all-time high and runs on a clear trend, it’s Bitcoin’s time to also run nice and clean.” The cryptocurrency analyst and trader, however, says Bitcoin is entering the “final stages of the bull market.” According to Pizzino, the conditions that trigger a bearish reversal are already forming. “And in this final leg of the market into these highs, still everything looking quite bullish. We’re obviously seeing more companies get into Bitcoin, becoming ‘Bitcoin treasury companies.’ Essentially dead companies with their stock price going up because they hold Bitcoin. And Bitcoin is going up. So don’t necessarily make the profits that the stock price suggests, it’s that they hold an asset with that value going up. Is there anything wrong with that? Not necessarily. But it does lead to further leverage in the system, which can and generally does unfold at the end of the cycle.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-18 14:33:01+00:00,Crypto Liquidations Top $812M as Bitcoin Surges Past $120K,"Overnight between July 17 and 18, the price of Bitcoin crossed the $120,000 mark. As a result, the total value of liquidations in the market reached $812.7 million. Most of these losses were incurred by traders holding short positions, totaling $483 million. Bitcoin surged overnight between July 17 and 18, 2025, briefly crossing the $120,000 mark and reaching a high of $120,998. According to TradingView, this move represented a daily gain of 2.5%. Most altcoins followed suit with notable increases, including XRP, which set a new all-time high of $3.65. As a result of this rapid market movement, the total value of liquidations in the crypto market over the past 24 hours reached $812.7 million, according to CoinGlass. The majority of losses impacted traders holding short positions—$483 million—while those with long positions lost $329.7 million. This wave of liquidations signals just how volatile and high-stakes leveraged trading can become during sharp rallies and market upheaval. The largest single liquidation occurred on the Binance exchange, where a position worth nearly $51 million was forcibly closed. In total, 174,391 traders had positions liquidated across the market during the same 24-hour period, underscoring the significant impact the rally had on investor portfolios and margin accounts. The top three platforms by total liquidation losses were Binance, Bybit, and OKX. By asset, Ethereum led liquidations with $238 million, followed by Bitcoin with $146 million, and XRP with $102.5 million. Notably, this intense market action attracted both new entrants and institutional investors seeking exposure to the ongoing crypto bull run. Amid the surge in cryptocurrency prices, total crypto market capitalization surpassed the $4 trillion mark for the first time, setting a new historic record. This level nearly matches the valuation of Nvidia—the world’s most valuable public company—which stood at nearly $4.2 trillion as of July 18, 2025.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10041/crypto-liquidations-top-812-m-as-bitcoin-surges-past-120-k,MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB,News|Crypto,BTC,"Crypto Liquidations Top $812M as Bitcoin Surges Past $120K.

According to real-time market monitoring, the BTC price has dipped below the crucial $118,000 mark, sending ripples across the entire digital asset landscape. Specifically, on the Binance USDT market, Bitcoin is currently trading at $117,957.3. This sudden Bitcoin Price Drop has immediately captured the attention of investors and traders alike, prompting questions about market stability and future trajectories. What does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these turbulent waters? What Triggered This Sudden Bitcoin Price Drop? When Bitcoin experiences a sharp decline, it’s rarely due to a single factor. The crypto market is a complex ecosystem influenced by a multitude of global and internal dynamics. Understanding these potential triggers is crucial for anyone involved in Bitcoin trading or holding cryptocurrency assets. Several elements often contribute to such rapid price movements: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic indicators, such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions, can significantly impact investor sentiment towards riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. When traditional markets show signs of instability, capital often flows out of speculative assets. Regulatory Uncertainty: News or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) among investors. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate digital assets, and any perceived negative stance can trigger sell-offs. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can move significant amounts of BTC, which can influence market supply and demand dynamics. A large sell-off by a whale can cascade into a broader market reaction. Technical Breakdown: From a technical analysis perspective, breaking below key support levels can trigger automated sell orders and panic selling. The $118,000 mark may have been identified as a critical support level by many algorithms and traders. Market Sentiment and Liquidation Cascades: A negative sentiment, fueled by social media trends or bearish news, can lead to increased selling pressure. In highly leveraged markets, a small dip can trigger liquidations, which in turn push prices further down, creating a ‘liquidation cascade.’ Navigating Crypto Market Volatility: A Trader’s Guide Crypto Market Volatility is an inherent characteristic of the digital asset space. While it presents risks, it also creates opportunities for astute traders. The recent BTC price movement serves as a stark reminder that market conditions can change rapidly. Here’s how you can approach such periods: Understanding Volatility Volatility refers to the degree of variation of a trading price series over time. In simpler terms, it measures how much an asset’s price fluctuates. Bitcoin is known for its high volatility compared to traditional assets like stocks or bonds. This means larger potential gains, but also larger potential losses. Actionable Strategies During a Dip For those engaged in Bitcoin trading , a strategic approach is paramount during periods of heightened volatility. Here are some insights: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never act on rumors. Always verify information from reliable sources before making investment decisions. Risk Management is Key: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Define your risk tolerance and stick to it. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These automated orders help limit potential losses by selling your asset if it drops to a predetermined price. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy can reduce the impact of volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: While Bitcoin is dominant, diversifying into other cryptocurrencies or even traditional assets can help mitigate risk. Risk Management Strategies for Bitcoin Traders Here’s a quick guide to some common risk management techniques: Strategy Description Benefit Stop-Loss Orders Automatically sells an asset if its price falls to a specified level. Limits potential losses in a rapidly falling market. Take-Profit Orders Automatically sells an asset when its price reaches a specified profit target. Secures gains and prevents emotional decision-making. Position Sizing Determining the appropriate amount of capital to allocate to a single trade.

2025-07-18 14:42:30+00:00,Quantum computing threatens to break Bitcoin’s elliptic curve cryptography,"A July 15 report by global consulting firm Capgemini warns that public-key cryptographic systems, including RSA and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), may be rendered obsolete by quantum machines in the near future. These are the algorithms that Bitcoin and other blockchains use to secure wallet addresses and authenticate transactions. Capgemini’s analysis does not specifically mention Bitcoin, but it talks about how ECC, the technology behind the blockchain’s private key, is vulnerable to quantum computing. ECC, like RSA, is susceptible to Shor’s algorithm because it is capable of solving the discrete logarithm problem, the mathematical principle that hides visibility of blockchain keys. ‘Post-quantum safety is a priority,’ says Capgemini The Capgemini report is based on a survey of 1,000 large organizations across 13 countries. It found that 70% of enterprises are either preparing for or already deploying post-quantum cryptography (PQC) solutions, a new generation of encryption meant to protect them from quantum attacks. The survey found that only 15% of companies were “quantum-safe,” and just 2% of global cybersecurity budgets are allocated towards quantum risk solutions. The report also spoke about the principle of “harvest now, decrypt later,” in which attackers stockpile encrypted data with the hope of unlocking it once quantum computing becomes powerful enough to break today’s cryptographic methods. Blockchain networks that expose public keys, including Bitcoin, could become exposed if bad actors decide to use this kind of breach. Over 25% of Bitcoins at risk More than a quarter of all Bitcoin in circulation has at some point revealed its public key on-chain. This places a target on their current holders in the event cryptographically relevant quantum computer (CRQC) becomes operational. That includes nearly 4 million BTC, among them the estimated 1 million coins linked to Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. A July 15 draft Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), co-authored by Bitcoin developer Jameson Lopp, proposed a phased mitigation plan to counter a possible pipeline to hackers. The plan was revealed at the invitation-only Quantum Bitcoin Summit of cybersecurity sleuths and blockchain developers, held in San Francisco last Monday. “ Never before has Bitcoin faced an existential threat to its cryptographic primitives ,” Lopp and his co-authors wrote in their BIP draft. “ A successful quantum attack on Bitcoin would result in significant economic disruption and damage across the entire ecosystem .” Lopp and five fellow developers listed three steps to safeguard the network. In the first phase, Bitcoin users would be prohibited from sending funds to quantum-vulnerable addresses. They would be directed to use a “quantum safe” new address format called P2QRH. Two years after the initial phase, the second step would freeze any coins still held in insecure addresses. The third and final phase, still under discussion, could allow users to recover frozen funds by using their BIP-39 seed phrases. “ This proposal is radically different from any in Bitcoin’s history, just as the threat posed by quantum computing is radically different from any other threat in Bitcoin’s history ,” the authors wrote. A past study by UK-based accounting services firm Deloitte investigated the aftermath of a quantum-based attack on the Bitcoin network. The company found that it could lead to mass liquidation of compromised coins. The result would likely be a collapse in price and market confidence, where hodlers will move for exit positions en masse, and in Lopp’s words, a “liquidation event” will ensue. “ People don’t believe it will happen until it happens, ” Julio Padilha, Chief Information Security Officer of Volkswagen and Audi South America noted in Capgemini’s report.

2025-07-18 14:53:48+00:00,BTC and XRP Hit Fresh Milestones as Altcoins Take Off: Your Weekly Crypto Recap,"It was a big week in the cryptocurrency world, with the US voting on a few legislations and fresh all-time highs for bitcoin and a some larger-cap altcoins. But first, let’s take you back to the previous one, which was critical in its own right. After all, BTC managed to break out of its consolidation phase last Wednesday and marked a new all-time high of almost $119,000 about this time last Friday. The weekend was calmer, but the largest cryptocurrency went on the offensive once again on Monday, surpassing $123,000 to set its latest record. More volatility ensued on Tuesday, but this time in the opposite direction , which drove the asset south by several grand to under $116,000. Nevertheless, the bulls reappeared after this somewhat expected correction, given the fact that BTC had gained about $15,000 within days without losing any traction. They stopped the freefall in the middle of the week and pushed bitcoin higher to $120,000 on a couple of occasions. That resistance, though, turned out to be harder to reclaim, and the subsequent rejections resulted in another price drop to under $118,000 as of press time.

It was a big week in the cryptocurrency world, with the US voting on a few legislations and fresh all-time highs for bitcoin and a some larger-cap altcoins. But first, let’s take you back to the previous one, which was critical in its own right. After all, BTC managed to break out of its consolidation phase last Wednesday and marked a new all-time high of almost $119,000 about this time last Friday. The weekend was calmer, but the largest cryptocurrency went on the offensive once again on Monday, surpassing $123,000 to set its latest record. More volatility ensued on Tuesday, but this time in the opposite direction , which drove the asset south by several grand to under $116,000. Nevertheless, the bulls reappeared after this somewhat expected correction, given the fact that BTC had gained about $15,000 within days without losing any traction. They stopped the freefall in the middle of the week and pushed bitcoin higher to $120,000 on a couple of occasions. That resistance, though, turned out to be harder to reclaim, and the subsequent rejections resulted in another price drop to under $118,000 as of press time. This means that BTC has essentially erased the weekly gains, even though it managed to register a fresh all-time high on Monday. In contrast, most altcoins have registered mindblowing weekly gains. Ripple’s cross-border token led the charge and notched a new record of its own at over $3.6 before it retraced toward the previous one of $3.4.

2025-07-18 14:59:43+00:00,Bitcoin quietly closes in on Gold’s market cap,"Bitcoin ( BTC ), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, hit an all-time high (ATH) of $123,091 on July 14. Similarly to its digital counterpart, gold has also experienced a significant surge, having gone up 35% in the past year with the potential to hit its own record price of $3,600 per ounce in H2 2025. Thanks to the upward momentum, Bitcoin now has a market cap of around $2.36 trillion, while the precious metal has a market cap of approximately $22.57 trillion. That is, Bitcoin is now worth 10% of gold’s market cap, being the sixth largest asset by the same metric, based on the data available on Companies Market Cap. To put things into perspective, the coin has overtaken silver , which now occupies the eighth spot, just below Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL). Top assets by market cap. Source: Companies Market Cap Will Bitcoin surpass gold? As both assets make substantial gains, the market is asking whether Bitcoin might surpass gold. At the time of writing, gold was priced at $3,355 per ounce. Compared to the January 1 price of $2,624, this implies a return on investment (ROI) of nearly 27.86%. On the other hand, Bitcoin was trading at $119,087. Compared to the average price of $93,425 on January 1, we get a nearly identical ROI of 27.48%. A number of analysts are accordingly bullish. Dan Held, for instance, predicts that Bitcoin will indeed overtake the market cap of gold. When that happens, Held claims, 1 BTC will be worth $1.1 million. Matt Hougan, the Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, also suggested Bitcoin could match gold in terms of valuation, similarly predicting 1 BTC would be worth $1.2 million by that time.

2025-07-18 15:00:30+00:00,Bitcoin Treasury Boom: Jim Chanos Unveils Urgent SPAC Bubble Warning,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Boom: Jim Chanos Unveils Urgent SPAC Bubble Warning In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, opportunities often appear alongside significant risks. For companies eyeing Bitcoin (BTC) as a treasury asset, the allure of digital gold can be powerful. However, a stark warning from a financial titan suggests that this burgeoning trend might be treading a familiar, perilous path. Could the current Bitcoin treasury boom be echoing a past financial craze that ended in significant losses? What is Jim Chanos Warning About? When legendary short seller Jim Chanos speaks, the financial world listens. Best known for his uncanny ability to predict the downfall of giants like U.S. energy firm Enron, Chanos has now turned his keen eye to the rapid rise of corporate Bitcoin strategies. His recent pronouncements, as reported by DL News, draw an unsettling parallel: he believes the current surge in companies adopting BTC for their treasuries is beginning to resemble the frenzied 2021 Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) mania. For those unfamiliar, SPACs were essentially shell companies created to raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO) with the sole purpose of acquiring an existing private company. The 2021 SPAC bubble saw a staggering $90 billion raised, often with speculative fervor rather than sound fundamentals. Chanos points to cautionary tales like electric truck startup Lordstown Motors and hydrogen truck maker Nikola, both of which saw their SPAC-fueled dreams unravel, leaving investors with significant losses. The core concern is that history might be rhyming, not repeating, but with a new digital asset at its core. The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Strategies: A Familiar Path? Why are companies suddenly flocking to put Bitcoin on their balance sheets? The motivations are varied, ranging from hedging against inflation and seeking a store of value to capitalizing on perceived growth opportunities in the crypto space. However, Chanos highlights a concerning trend: more than 130 companies are now issuing convertible notes and preferred shares specifically to acquire BTC. Among these are prominent names like Metaplanet and Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which has become synonymous with large-scale corporate Bitcoin adoption. Chanos’s critique is sharp: many of these companies, he argues, are engaging in what he terms “hype-driven financial engineering,” often without viable business models to support their core operations, let alone their speculative treasury strategies. Instead of focusing on generating revenue from their primary services or products, their value proposition increasingly hinges on the appreciation of their Bitcoin holdings. This shift in focus from fundamental business operations to asset speculation is a red flag for experienced market observers like Chanos. Are Corporate Bitcoin Holdings a New SPAC Bubble? The parallels Chanos draws between the current Bitcoin treasury boom and the SPAC bubble are compelling. Both phenomena exhibited rapid, often irrational, growth fueled by speculative sentiment rather than underlying fundamentals. In the SPAC era, companies with little more than a concept could raise vast sums. Today, Chanos suggests, some companies are leveraging traditional financial instruments to acquire a volatile digital asset, effectively transforming themselves into Bitcoin holding companies, regardless of their original business. This creates a scenario where their fortunes are tied less to their operational success and more to the volatile swings of the crypto market. The risk, as Chanos warns, is that much like the SPAC bust, this trend could unravel once liquidity fades or market sentiment shifts. When investor enthusiasm wanes, or if Bitcoin experiences a significant downturn, companies whose balance sheets are heavily reliant on BTC could face severe pressure. This could lead to a cascade of issues, including forced sales of Bitcoin, declining share prices, and even solvency concerns for those with weak underlying businesses. The 2021 SPAC market demonstrated how quickly euphoria can turn into despair when the music stops. Navigating the Crypto Market Warning: Insights for Investors and Companies So, what does this crypto market warning mean for investors and companies alike? For investors, Chanos’s insights underscore the critical importance of due diligence. It’s no longer enough to simply look at a company’s Bitcoin holdings; one must scrutinize its core business model, revenue streams, and long-term viability. Questions to ask include: Does the company have a strong, profitable business independent of its Bitcoin treasury? How significant are its Bitcoin holdings relative to its overall assets and liabilities? What is the company’s strategy for managing Bitcoin price volatility? Is the company using sound financial practices, or is it engaging in excessive leverage or ‘financial engineering’?

It now holds one of the biggest Ethereum treasuries among public companies, only behind SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion. It previously stated that “Ethereum can rewrite the entire financial system” and also aims to become the world’s leading ETH holding company. Earlier in July, Bit Digital sold around 280 BTC and used $172 million in funding to buy over 100,000 ETH, fully shifting its treasury from Bitcoin to Ethereum. This is also part of a growing trend among public companies like SharpLink Gaming and BitMine Immersion, which are moving towards Ethereum over Bitcoin. Ethereum – the Future of Digital Finance Bit Digital views Ethereum as the backbone of future digital finance, highlighting its flexibility, rising adoption, and staking rewards. It plans to keep increasing its Ethereum holdings as part of a long-term strategy. Ether has doubled in the past three months with rising institutional interest. In June, Bitmine launched a $250 million raise to start building its Ethereum treasury, with Fundstrat’s head of research, Thomas Lee, as a board member. Ethereum is playing a bigger role in real-world finance, powering stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized apps.

2025-07-18 15:14:59+00:00,Bitcoin’s Path to $200K Looks Likely—But XYZVerse May Yield 10× Greater ROI by 2026,"As Bitcoin seems poised for a significant surge, reaching new peaks, investors are looking toward opportunities with even higher returns. XYZVerse, a rising cryptocurrency, is predicted to deliver returns ten times greater than Bitcoin by 2026. This article examines the factors driving Bitcoin’s growth and why XYZVerse might be the next standout investment in the crypto space. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price , far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse’s commitment to expanding its utility. It’s a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet—a nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin (BTC) has seen notable gains recently. Over the past week, its price increased by 6.29%. Looking at the past month, the price rose by 10.74%. Over the last six months, there’s a growth of 13.99%. Currently, Bitcoin is trading between $111134 and $122428. The nearest resistance level is at $126231, which is about 3% above the current upper range. The nearest support level is at $103644, approximately 7% below the lower end of the current range. If Bitcoin breaks above the first resistance, it could target the second resistance level at $137525, which is around 9% higher. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $118407 and $118501 respectively, suggesting a stable trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 46.64, indicating the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is -12.99, which may signal some bearish momentum. However, the recent positive price changes suggest potential for further growth if Bitcoin surpasses the resistance levels. Conclusion While BTC and other top cryptocurrencies hold strong prospects, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend and 20,000% growth target make it a standout investment by 2026.

2025-07-18 15:19:38+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Prediction 18 July, 2025: Can BTC Go To $142K, As Crypto Market Cap Hits $4 Trillion For the First Time Ever?","The global crypto market capitalization has reached the $4 trillion milestone for the first time , driven by massive capital inflows, particularly into Bitcoin, which continues to dominate over 59% of the total crypto market valuation. To provide perspective, since January 2024, more than $2 trillion in fresh capital has flowed into the cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin capturing over $1.2 trillion of these new investments. Source: Coingecko While Bitcoin’s momentum has moderated over the past 48 hours, creating opportunities for altcoins like Ethereum and Solana to surge , market analysts continue to project that BTC will maintain its trajectory toward a $142,000 price target. CryptoQuant Reveals a 20-25% Upside that Could Fuel $140K BTC Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,856 after reaching highs near $123,000 and encountering bearish buy-side liquidity, which has led to rejection and established a mid-range bearish configuration. However, according to CryptoQuant’s analysis , the Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV indicator suggests additional upside potential for Bitcoin lies ahead. Historical data shows that whenever the STH MVRV reaches approximately 1.35, representing +35% unrealized gains, it typically triggers profit-taking activities, usually followed by short-term price corrections. Source: CryptoQuant Currently, BTC remains considerably below that threshold as the present STH MVRV sits around 1.15, indicating Bitcoin still has potential to climb approximately 20% to 25% before reaching that critical MVRV level again. Furthermore, U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to open the $9 trillion American retirement market to investments in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as covered by the Financial Times. A 20% rally from current levels, pushing BTC above $140,000, remains highly plausible. Technical Analysis: Will $121K Resistance Break or Hold? From a technical perspective, the Bitcoin ( BTC/USDT ) daily chart displays a consolidation pattern just beneath the crucial $121K resistance zone. The price is trading above the 9-day simple moving average (SMA), indicating sustained bullish momentum. A breakout above this consolidation range would likely trigger a move toward the next major target at $132,286. The RSI at 70.08 signals slightly overbought conditions, although not yet at extreme levels, suggesting that buyers still maintain control. Support is firmly established at $111K, backed by both horizontal structure and proximity to the STH MVRV line at $102,764.29, which often marks a value zone for short-term holders.

The global crypto market capitalization has reached the $4 trillion milestone for the first time , driven by massive capital inflows, particularly into Bitcoin, which continues to dominate over 59% of the total crypto market valuation. To provide perspective, since January 2024, more than $2 trillion in fresh capital has flowed into the cryptocurrency markets, with Bitcoin capturing over $1.2 trillion of these new investments. Source: Coingecko While Bitcoin’s momentum has moderated over the past 48 hours, creating opportunities for altcoins like Ethereum and Solana to surge , market analysts continue to project that BTC will maintain its trajectory toward a $142,000 price target. CryptoQuant Reveals a 20-25% Upside that Could Fuel $140K BTC Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,856 after reaching highs near $123,000 and encountering bearish buy-side liquidity, which has led to rejection and established a mid-range bearish configuration. However, according to CryptoQuant’s analysis , the Short-Term Holder (STH) MVRV indicator suggests additional upside potential for Bitcoin lies ahead. Historical data shows that whenever the STH MVRV reaches approximately 1.35, representing +35% unrealized gains, it typically triggers profit-taking activities, usually followed by short-term price corrections. Source: CryptoQuant Currently, BTC remains considerably below that threshold as the present STH MVRV sits around 1.15, indicating Bitcoin still has potential to climb approximately 20% to 25% before reaching that critical MVRV level again. Furthermore, U.S. President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to open the $9 trillion American retirement market to investments in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, as covered by the Financial Times. A 20% rally from current levels, pushing BTC above $140,000, remains highly plausible. Technical Analysis: Will $121K Resistance Break or Hold? From a technical perspective, the Bitcoin ( BTC/USDT ) daily chart displays a consolidation pattern just beneath the crucial $121K resistance zone. The price is trading above the 9-day simple moving average (SMA), indicating sustained bullish momentum. A breakout above this consolidation range would likely trigger a move toward the next major target at $132,286. The RSI at 70.08 signals slightly overbought conditions, although not yet at extreme levels, suggesting that buyers still maintain control. Support is firmly established at $111K, backed by both horizontal structure and proximity to the STH MVRV line at $102,764.29, which often marks a value zone for short-term holders. Overall, the structure leans bullish, and if Bitcoin decisively breaks $121K, it may ignite a strong continuation toward the upper price target. However, a failure to clear resistance could result in another retest of the $111K–$115K support zone.

2025-07-18 15:20:18+00:00,Ethereum ETFs Surge: Over $600 Million Inflows Mark Historic Confidence,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETFs Surge: Over $600 Million Inflows Mark Historic Confidence The world of digital assets is buzzing with electrifying news! On July 17, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a staggering combined net inflow of $600.25 million. This isn’t just a one-off event; it marks the tenth consecutive day of positive flows, signaling a profound shift in investor sentiment and a growing embrace of Ethereum within traditional finance. This consistent influx of capital underscores a burgeoning confidence in the second-largest cryptocurrency and its underlying ecosystem. Ethereum ETFs : Unpacking the $600 Million Momentum The recent surge in capital flowing into Ethereum ETFs is a clear indicator of institutional appetite for exposure to digital assets. The $600.25 million figure, as reported by @thepfund on X, is not merely a number; it represents a significant vote of confidence from large-scale investors. These ETFs provide a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional financial entities and individual investors alike to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. What makes these inflows particularly noteworthy is their sustained nature. A ten-day streak of positive flows suggests that this isn’t speculative short-term interest but rather a more fundamental shift towards incorporating digital assets into diversified portfolios. This sustained momentum could pave the way for greater market stability and liquidity for Ethereum. Why Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Gaining Traction? The distinction between ‘spot’ and ‘futures’ ETFs is crucial here. While futures ETFs track the price of futures contracts for an asset, Spot Ethereum ETFs directly hold the underlying Ether. This direct exposure is often preferred by investors seeking to mirror the actual price movements of the asset, offering a more direct investment vehicle. The approval and subsequent performance of these spot products represent a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency market. The July 17 inflows highlight specific leaders in this burgeoning market: BlackRock’s ETHA: A dominant leader, attracting $544.94 million in inflows. Grayscale’s mini ETH: Secured a notable $29.9 million. Fidelity’s FETH: Saw strong interest with $17.19 million in inflows. Bitwise’s ETHW: Added $4.44 million to its holdings. ARK 21Shares’ CETH: Recorded $3.78 million in net inflows. The overwhelming lead of BlackRock’s ETHA is particularly telling, reflecting the trust and reach of one of the world’s largest asset managers in the digital asset space. Decoding the Consistent ETH Inflows : What Does the Streak Mean? A ten-day consecutive streak of positive ETH inflows is more than just a statistical anomaly; it’s a powerful signal of evolving market dynamics. This sustained buying pressure indicates that institutional investors are not just dipping their toes but are actively allocating significant capital to Ethereum. This trend can be attributed to several factors: Growing Maturity of the Ecosystem: Ethereum’s foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts makes it an attractive long-term investment. Regulatory Clarity (Emerging): While still evolving, the regulatory landscape around crypto ETFs is slowly becoming clearer, providing a more comfortable environment for institutional participation. Bitcoin ETF Precedent: The successful launch and performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs likely paved the way, building confidence for similar Ethereum products. Diversification Strategy: Institutions are increasingly looking at crypto as a new asset class for diversification, and Ethereum, with its robust utility, is a prime candidate. This consistent demand suggests a deeper, more fundamental shift in how traditional finance views and integrates digital assets. The Broader Impact: Accelerating Institutional Crypto Adoption The remarkable performance of U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs is a cornerstone in the ongoing narrative of institutional crypto adoption . For years, the crypto market was primarily driven by retail investors. However, the entry of major players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity signifies a seismic shift. Institutions bring not just capital but also legitimacy, stability, and broader market reach. This increased institutional involvement can lead to: Enhanced Liquidity: Larger capital pools can create deeper markets, reducing volatility and making price discovery more efficient. Mainstream Acceptance: When established financial giants offer crypto products, it normalizes digital assets for a wider audience, including those previously hesitant to engage directly. Regulatory Framework Development: Institutional pressure often prompts regulators to develop clearer, more comprehensive frameworks, benefiting the entire industry. The trend indicates that cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum, are no longer niche investments but are becoming integral components of modern investment portfolios.

Companies are increasingly investing in crypto for their treasuries , particularly in BTC. This creates “a meaningful new source of demand.” Leveraged funding of crypto purchases could present risks related to forced or motivated discretionary selling over the medium- to long-term, the report states. However, the analysts argue this shouldn’t be a problem in the short term. “We’re confident about bitcoin’s upward trajectory even in the face of such risks, but we think only select altcoins may perform well depending on their idiosyncratic circumstances.” Meanwhile, the analysts noted that major tokens surged from their 2025 lows sooner than expected. Bitcoin hit new all-time highs in May and July. “We think there could be more upside in the quarter ahead,” they said. There are several factors that have led to this conclusion. The report named increased crypto adoption by corporate treasuries, as well as several US-related factors. The latter includes beneficial regulatory developments, an optimistic outlook for economic growth, the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts, and the cooling of the tariff-related concerns. “Going forward, risk sentiment should broadly benefit from the US government’s pivot towards more market-friendly policies,” the report argued.

2025-07-18 15:25:18+00:00,Ethereum Under Pressure: AguilaTrades’ Audacious $140M Short,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Under Pressure: AguilaTrades’ Audacious $140M Short The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with news of a monumental trade that could send ripples across the market. Imagine placing a bet worth $140 million on the future direction of one of the largest digital assets. That’s precisely what a prominent entity, AguilaTrades, has done, initiating a massive Ethereum short position. This isn’t just any trade; it’s a high-stakes move, leveraging a staggering amount of capital and potentially signaling a significant shift in market sentiment . What Just Happened with AguilaTrades’ Massive ETH Leverage Bet? In a move that has captured the attention of traders and analysts alike, AguilaTrades, a notable player in the digital asset space, has publicly revealed an audacious new position. According to a recent post by ai_9684xtpa on X, AguilaTrades has opened a colossal $140 million Ethereum short position. What makes this particularly noteworthy is that it marks the first time this entity has used a public address for such a significant trade, adding a layer of transparency and intrigue. Let’s break down the specifics of this monumental trade: Total Value: $140 million Amount of ETH: 39,144.56 ETH Leverage: A substantial 15x Entry Price: $3,593.46 per ETH Liquidation Price: $3,987.20 per ETH This aggressive use of ETH leverage means that AguilaTrades stands to gain significantly if Ethereum’s price drops, but also faces substantial risk if it rises. The proximity of the liquidation price to the entry price, given the 15x leverage, highlights the extreme risk involved in this particular crypto trading strategy. Why Does This AguilaTrades’ Move Matter for Market Sentiment? When a major player like AguilaTrades takes such a decisive, public stance, it inevitably influences broader market sentiment . A $140 million Ethereum short isn’t just a personal bet; it can be interpreted as a strong signal of bearish conviction. In the often-speculative world of cryptocurrencies, large trades can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, pushing prices in the anticipated direction as other traders react. Here’s why this move is generating so much discussion: Bearish Signal: It suggests that AguilaTrades believes Ethereum’s price is due for a significant correction. Potential for Volatility: Such a large position can exacerbate price movements, especially if other large players follow suit or attempt to liquidate the position. Influence on Retail Traders: Smaller traders often look to large institutional or whale movements for cues. This could encourage a wave of shorting or profit-taking among retail investors. The fact that this is the first time AguilaTrades has used a public address for such a trade also raises questions. Is it a deliberate signal? A challenge? Or simply a new strategy for transparency in their high-stakes crypto trading operations? Understanding the Perils and Potential of 15x ETH Leverage Leverage is a double-edged sword in crypto trading . While it magnifies potential gains, it equally amplifies potential losses. With 15x ETH leverage , AguilaTrades is controlling $140 million worth of Ethereum with a much smaller amount of their own capital (roughly $9.33 million, as $140M / 15). This means a relatively small price movement against their position can lead to significant losses, or even complete liquidation. Consider the implications: Scenario Impact on AguilaTrades’ Position (Approximate) Outcome ETH drops 5% ($179.67) Gains $7 million (5% of $140M) Significant Profit ETH rises 5% ($179.67) Loses $7 million (5% of $140M) Significant Loss ETH reaches Liquidation Price ($3,987.20) Loses initial margin (~$9.33 million) Full Liquidation The liquidation price of $3,987.20 is only about 11% above the entry price of $3,593.46. This narrow margin highlights the aggressive nature of the bet and the high level of confidence (or risk tolerance) AguilaTrades must possess in their Ethereum short thesis. For any trader, understanding these mechanics is crucial before engaging in leveraged crypto trading . What Could Drive the Outcome of This Ethereum Short Position? The success or failure of AguilaTrades’ massive Ethereum short will depend on a confluence of factors influencing Ethereum’s price. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and unexpected news or macroeconomic shifts can quickly alter price trajectories. Understanding these potential drivers is key to analyzing the broader market sentiment . Key factors to watch include: Macroeconomic Data: Inflation reports, interest rate decisions, and global economic stability can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Developments: New regulations or enforcement actions in major jurisdictions could create uncertainty or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), potentially driving prices down.

Imagine placing a bet worth $140 million on the future direction of one of the largest digital assets. That’s precisely what a prominent entity, AguilaTrades, has done, initiating a massive Ethereum short position. This isn’t just any trade; it’s a high-stakes move, leveraging a staggering amount of capital and potentially signaling a significant shift in market sentiment . What Just Happened with AguilaTrades’ Massive ETH Leverage Bet? In a move that has captured the attention of traders and analysts alike, AguilaTrades, a notable player in the digital asset space, has publicly revealed an audacious new position. According to a recent post by ai_9684xtpa on X, AguilaTrades has opened a colossal $140 million Ethereum short position. What makes this particularly noteworthy is that it marks the first time this entity has used a public address for such a significant trade, adding a layer of transparency and intrigue. Let’s break down the specifics of this monumental trade: Total Value: $140 million Amount of ETH: 39,144.56 ETH Leverage: A substantial 15x Entry Price: $3,593.46 per ETH Liquidation Price: $3,987.20 per ETH This aggressive use of ETH leverage means that AguilaTrades stands to gain significantly if Ethereum’s price drops, but also faces substantial risk if it rises. The proximity of the liquidation price to the entry price, given the 15x leverage, highlights the extreme risk involved in this particular crypto trading strategy. Why Does This AguilaTrades’ Move Matter for Market Sentiment? When a major player like AguilaTrades takes such a decisive, public stance, it inevitably influences broader market sentiment . A $140 million Ethereum short isn’t just a personal bet; it can be interpreted as a strong signal of bearish conviction. In the often-speculative world of cryptocurrencies, large trades can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, pushing prices in the anticipated direction as other traders react. Here’s why this move is generating so much discussion: Bearish Signal: It suggests that AguilaTrades believes Ethereum’s price is due for a significant correction. Potential for Volatility: Such a large position can exacerbate price movements, especially if other large players follow suit or attempt to liquidate the position. Influence on Retail Traders: Smaller traders often look to large institutional or whale movements for cues. This could encourage a wave of shorting or profit-taking among retail investors. The fact that this is the first time AguilaTrades has used a public address for such a trade also raises questions. Is it a deliberate signal? A challenge? Or simply a new strategy for transparency in their high-stakes crypto trading operations? Understanding the Perils and Potential of 15x ETH Leverage Leverage is a double-edged sword in crypto trading . While it magnifies potential gains, it equally amplifies potential losses. With 15x ETH leverage , AguilaTrades is controlling $140 million worth of Ethereum with a much smaller amount of their own capital (roughly $9.33 million, as $140M / 15). This means a relatively small price movement against their position can lead to significant losses, or even complete liquidation. Consider the implications: Scenario Impact on AguilaTrades’ Position (Approximate) Outcome ETH drops 5% ($179.67) Gains $7 million (5% of $140M) Significant Profit ETH rises 5% ($179.67) Loses $7 million (5% of $140M) Significant Loss ETH reaches Liquidation Price ($3,987.20) Loses initial margin (~$9.33 million) Full Liquidation The liquidation price of $3,987.20 is only about 11% above the entry price of $3,593.46. This narrow margin highlights the aggressive nature of the bet and the high level of confidence (or risk tolerance) AguilaTrades must possess in their Ethereum short thesis. For any trader, understanding these mechanics is crucial before engaging in leveraged crypto trading . What Could Drive the Outcome of This Ethereum Short Position? The success or failure of AguilaTrades’ massive Ethereum short will depend on a confluence of factors influencing Ethereum’s price. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and unexpected news or macroeconomic shifts can quickly alter price trajectories. Understanding these potential drivers is key to analyzing the broader market sentiment . Key factors to watch include: Macroeconomic Data: Inflation reports, interest rate decisions, and global economic stability can significantly impact investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Developments: New regulations or enforcement actions in major jurisdictions could create uncertainty or FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), potentially driving prices down.

2025-07-18 15:30:06+00:00,BlackRock Seeks ETH Staking Integration — Here''s Why These 3 Layer 1 Tokens Will Dominate Next,"BlackRock''s move towards Ethereum staking has stirred the crypto world. This shift is a signal of bigger trends brewing in the market. Tied closely to this are three Layer 1 tokens poised for substantial growth. Find out which emerging coins could dominate the next wave in the blockchain revolution. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Momentum, Key Levels, and Trading Setups Bitcoin posted a one-month price increase of 15.17% and a six-month gain of 16.24%, with a one-week rise of 4.53%. Price fluctuations reflect steady upward movement within a clearly defined range. The gains over these periods showcase consistent growth and cautious consolidation. Recent performance highlights sustained buyer interest with moderate volatility, laying the groundwork for future upward moves without dramatic swings. The trend has been maintained over both shorter and longer durations, indicating stable investor sentiment and gradual accumulation of value. Current prices trade between approximately $100,193 and $112,335. A key support level sits near $93,218 while primary resistance is around $117,502. A secondary support near $81,076 and higher resistance near $129,644 add further context. High values for the Momentum Indicator at 11,451 and the Awesome Oscillator at 9,562 reflect strong upward force, though an RSI of 72.44 suggests overbought conditions. Bulls currently dominate, yet no clear breakout trend has been confirmed. Traders may consider long positions on small retracements toward support, with attention to a decisive move above $117,502 indicating further bullish momentum. Conversely, a breakdown below $93,218 could prompt a defensive shift. Solana Price Journey: Mixed Recent Gains and Long-Term Setbacks Past month performance SOL shows a gain of 23.08%, while over the last six months, the coin experienced a decline of 30.55%. Price action has been robust in the short term, with a 1-week increase of 10.61%, suggesting buying interest despite the longer-term downturn. These figures indicate energetic moves in recent weeks that contrast with the broader downtrend observed over the past half year. Current price levels range between $131 and $173.35, with the nearest support at $107.89 and resistance at $191.79. A secondary layer includes support at $65.94 and resistance at $233.74. Short-term indicators suggest bullish pressure, with a Relative Strength Index of 72.785. Caution is advised due to the six-month decline. The market has a mix of bullish drive and the potential for profit targets near resistance levels, along with the need for consolidation near support levels. Trading within these boundaries may present opportunities for gains if momentum is maintained. Ethereum: Monthly Surge Amid Critical Support and Resistance Levels Ethereum experienced a 43.95% increase over the last month with prices moving between $2110 and $2870, while the half-year performance registered a modest rise of 9.38%. The one-week change of 22.47% highlighted strong short-term buying and active market sentiment. Price movements indicate a burst of momentum that contrasts with steadier longer-term progress, suggesting recent trading activity has accelerated in the short run. Volatility remained as the price oscillated within this range, pointing to dynamic market forces at play without completely abandoning long-term stability. Current market conditions show Ethereum testing critical levels with pressure building on both ends. The price currently sits between nearest support at $1735.29 and nearby resistance at $3254.36, with a second resistance at $4013.88 and another support around $975.77. The high RSI of 85.53 signals overbought territory, yet the momentum indicator hints that buyers remain active. Bulls dominate in the short run, as evidenced by the weekly increase and monthly climb, while the modest change over six months suggests steady support. Traders might consider buying near $1735.29 and reducing exposure near $3254.36, with caution should a breakout above this level occur. Conclusion As Ethereum staking gains traction, attention turns to three major tokens. Bitcoin remains a stronghold for value storage. Solana offers high transaction speeds, appealing to developers and users alike. Ethereum continues to innovate with its staking model, increasing its appeal. This trio is set to lead the market, driven by unique strengths in security, speed, and adaptability. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-18 15:30:18+00:00,Crypto Liquidations: A $101 Million Shockwave Rocks the Futures Market,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations: A $101 Million Shockwave Rocks the Futures Market The cryptocurrency market has once again delivered a stark reminder of its inherent volatility, with a staggering $101 million worth of crypto futures liquidated in just the past hour . This dramatic event is part of a larger trend, as the past 24 hours have seen a colossal $884 million in futures positions wiped out across major exchanges. For traders involved in futures trading , these figures represent significant losses and a swift end to highly leveraged positions. What exactly does this mean for the market, and why are such massive crypto liquidations occurring? What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations and Futures Trading? To understand the impact of these figures, it’s crucial to grasp the basics of crypto futures and liquidations. Crypto futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. They are popular for their ability to provide leverage, meaning traders can open positions much larger than their initial capital. However, this amplified exposure comes with amplified risk. Futures Contracts: Agreements to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Leverage: Using borrowed capital to increase potential returns. A 10x leverage means a $1,000 investment can control a $10,000 position. Liquidation: When a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange due to the market moving against them, and their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level. This is designed to prevent the trader’s balance from going negative. The recent surge in crypto liquidations indicates that many traders, particularly those using high leverage, were caught off guard by a sudden price movement. This rapid unwinding of positions can create a cascading effect, further exacerbating market declines. Why Such Extreme Market Volatility Triggers Mass Liquidations? The primary catalyst for mass liquidations is often sudden and significant market volatility . When prices swing sharply in an unexpected direction, traders with leveraged positions face margin calls. If they cannot add more collateral quickly, their positions are liquidated. Several factors contribute to this: Unexpected Price Movements: A sudden dump or pump in the market, triggered by macro events, whale activity, or unexpected news, can push prices beyond traders’ liquidation thresholds. High Leverage: While enticing for potential gains, high leverage drastically reduces the margin for error. A small percentage move against a highly leveraged position can lead to complete loss of collateral. Market Sentiment Shifts: Rapid changes in investor sentiment, perhaps due to regulatory news or a significant economic indicator, can lead to panic selling or buying, creating the conditions for mass liquidations. The sheer scale of $101 million liquidated in an hour underscores the ferocity of the recent market movements. This isn’t just a minor correction; it’s a significant purge of over-leveraged positions, clearing the way for what might be a new phase of market behavior. Navigating the Risks of Leveraged Trading: Lessons from the Bitcoin Futures Market While the exact breakdown of liquidated assets isn’t always immediately public, historical data suggests that Bitcoin futures often account for a significant portion of these liquidations due to its large market capitalization and high trading volume. However, altcoin futures are also highly susceptible, especially those with lower liquidity. For those engaged in leveraged trading , this event serves as a critical reminder: Challenge Actionable Insight High Risk of Capital Loss Use conservative leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Unpredictable Market Swings Implement strict stop-loss orders to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level. Emotional Trading Decisions Develop a clear trading plan and stick to it, avoiding impulsive actions during volatile periods. Lack of Market Understanding Continuously educate yourself on market mechanics, technical analysis, and risk management strategies. What Can Traders Learn from This Futures Market Calamity? The recent liquidation cascade is a harsh but valuable lesson for all participants in the crypto space. It highlights the importance of robust risk management, even for experienced traders. The promise of quick riches through high leverage often blinds traders to the equally rapid potential for significant losses. Diversification, understanding market cycles, and staying informed about global economic factors are also crucial. Ultimately, while futures trading offers powerful tools for speculation and hedging, it demands respect for its inherent risks.

2025-07-18 15:40:18+00:00,Crypto 401k: Unlocking New Opportunities for Retirement Investing with SEC Guidance,"BitcoinWorld Crypto 401k: Unlocking New Opportunities for Retirement Investing with SEC Guidance Imagine a future where your retirement savings aren’t just tied to traditional stocks and bonds, but also tap into the exciting potential of digital assets. For years, the idea of including cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans seemed like a distant dream, fraught with regulatory hurdles and market volatility. However, a significant shift is underway, signaling a new era for retirement planning. Recently, U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, a figure whose insights often shape the trajectory of financial markets, expressed a surprising openness to the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. His stance, emphasizing the critical need for clear disclosure and robust risk awareness, marks a pivotal moment. This isn’t just a fleeting comment; it aligns with broader policy shifts anticipated under a potential President Trump administration and echoes recent actions by financial giants like Fidelity, who have already begun exploring expanded crypto access for retirement accounts. The Labor Department’s evolving perspective also plays a role, indicating a growing acceptance of digital assets within the established financial framework. This evolving landscape begs the question: are we on the cusp of a major transformation in how Americans save for retirement? Why is Crypto 401k Gaining Traction Now? The journey of cryptocurrencies from niche digital curiosities to potentially mainstream investment vehicles has been remarkable. For a long time, regulatory bodies, including the SEC, maintained a cautious, if not skeptical, stance on integrating highly volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum into retirement portfolios. Their primary concern has always been investor protection, especially for those saving for their golden years. However, several factors are contributing to this shift: Maturing Market: The crypto market, while still volatile, has grown significantly in size, liquidity, and institutional participation. More robust infrastructure, regulated exchanges, and custody solutions are emerging, making it less of a Wild West and more of a developing frontier. Investor Demand: A growing number of individuals, particularly younger generations, are keen to include digital assets in their long-term investment strategies. They see cryptocurrencies not just as speculative plays but as legitimate asset classes with unique value propositions. Political Landscape: The political environment, particularly with the prospect of a new administration, often brings changes in regulatory philosophy. Paul Atkins’ comments reflect a potential shift towards a more innovation-friendly approach, balancing consumer protection with market access. Industry Innovation: Firms like Fidelity have been proactive, launching initiatives to allow limited crypto exposure in 401(k)s, albeit with significant safeguards.

What Are the Potential Benefits of Retirement Investing Crypto ? For many, the allure of adding cryptocurrencies to a retirement portfolio lies in the potential for enhanced returns and portfolio diversification. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the historical growth of leading cryptocurrencies has been exponential, far outpacing traditional asset classes over certain periods. This upside potential is a significant draw for long-term investors. Let’s explore some key benefits: Portfolio Diversification: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have historically shown a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This means that when traditional markets face downturns, crypto assets might behave differently, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and volatility. Think of it as adding a new flavor to your investment mix. Inflation Hedge Potential: In an era of increasing inflation concerns, some argue that cryptocurrencies, especially those with fixed supplies like Bitcoin, could act as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. While this theory is still debated, it’s a compelling argument for those seeking to preserve purchasing power over decades.

BitcoinWorld Crypto 401k: Unlocking New Opportunities for Retirement Investing with SEC Guidance Imagine a future where your retirement savings aren’t just tied to traditional stocks and bonds, but also tap into the exciting potential of digital assets. For years, the idea of including cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans seemed like a distant dream, fraught with regulatory hurdles and market volatility. However, a significant shift is underway, signaling a new era for retirement planning. Recently, U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, a figure whose insights often shape the trajectory of financial markets, expressed a surprising openness to the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. His stance, emphasizing the critical need for clear disclosure and robust risk awareness, marks a pivotal moment. This isn’t just a fleeting comment; it aligns with broader policy shifts anticipated under a potential President Trump administration and echoes recent actions by financial giants like Fidelity, who have already begun exploring expanded crypto access for retirement accounts. The Labor Department’s evolving perspective also plays a role, indicating a growing acceptance of digital assets within the established financial framework. This evolving landscape begs the question: are we on the cusp of a major transformation in how Americans save for retirement? Why is Crypto 401k Gaining Traction Now? The journey of cryptocurrencies from niche digital curiosities to potentially mainstream investment vehicles has been remarkable. For a long time, regulatory bodies, including the SEC, maintained a cautious, if not skeptical, stance on integrating highly volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum into retirement portfolios. Their primary concern has always been investor protection, especially for those saving for their golden years. However, several factors are contributing to this shift: Maturing Market: The crypto market, while still volatile, has grown significantly in size, liquidity, and institutional participation. More robust infrastructure, regulated exchanges, and custody solutions are emerging, making it less of a Wild West and more of a developing frontier. Investor Demand: A growing number of individuals, particularly younger generations, are keen to include digital assets in their long-term investment strategies. They see cryptocurrencies not just as speculative plays but as legitimate asset classes with unique value propositions. Political Landscape: The political environment, particularly with the prospect of a new administration, often brings changes in regulatory philosophy. Paul Atkins’ comments reflect a potential shift towards a more innovation-friendly approach, balancing consumer protection with market access. Industry Innovation: Firms like Fidelity have been proactive, launching initiatives to allow limited crypto exposure in 401(k)s, albeit with significant safeguards.

2025-07-18 15:55:27+00:00,Ethereum Price Prediction: How High Can ETH Really Go by 2026?,"The post Ethereum Price Prediction: How High Can ETH Really Go by 2026? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum (ETH) has been on a strong rally this July, making it one of the best-performing months for the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. After recently touching the $3,500 level, many investors are now wondering: how high can ETH actually go in this cycle? Looking at Ethereum’s chart, the last all-time high was set back in November 2021 at around $4,900. Now, ETH is once again approaching important resistance levels, especially near $3,650 and $4,000. If it breaks through these zones, analysts say a push toward the previous high, and even beyond, is very likely. Ethereum is forming what’s called an “inverse cup and handle,” a bullish formation that has led to big price breakouts in other assets like Bitcoin and gold. If ETH follows this pattern, the breakout could eventually target $10,000 or even higher, with some ambitious predictions supporting a long-term target of $15,000 by 2026. Important resistance points ahead include $3,800, $4,000, and the previous top of $4,900–$5,000. Beyond that, if the breakout is strong, $10,000 could become a realistic goal in late 2025 or early 2026. Market conditions also look favorable. Global liquidity is increasing, interest rates are expected to fall, and Bitcoin dominance is slightly declining, all good signs for Ethereum. As altcoins usually follow Bitcoin’s lead, this could be ETH’s moment to shine. In the short term, some pullbacks or consolidation could happen near resistance levels. But overall, analysts remain bullish. Many traders are choosing to stay long on Ethereum, expecting that the best is yet to come.

The recent announcement from Bitcoin Treasury Capital (BTC AB) has once again put the spotlight on the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings. Imagine a company so dedicated to Bitcoin that its very name reflects its primary asset strategy. This isn’t just a fleeting interest; it’s a calculated move that speaks volumes about the evolving perception of Bitcoin in traditional finance. Understanding Bitcoin Treasury Capital’s Latest BTC Acquisition The news broke via X (formerly Twitter): Bitcoin Treasury Capital (BTC AB) has just bolstered its digital asset portfolio with an additional purchase of 4.5 BTC. While 4.5 Bitcoin might seem like a modest sum to some, it represents a strategic increment that brings their total holdings to an impressive 156 BTC. This isn’t a one-off event but part of an ongoing commitment by BTC AB to integrate Bitcoin deeply into its treasury management strategy. Their consistent accumulation underscores a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin Treasury Capital is a prime example of a company specifically structured around holding Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. Unlike traditional corporations that might allocate a small percentage to crypto, BTC AB’s core mission revolves around leveraging Bitcoin for its potential as a store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. This latest BTC acquisition isn’t merely a transaction; it’s a reaffirmation of their conviction and a testament to the increasing institutional comfort with the world’s leading cryptocurrency. This move by BTC AB reflects a broader narrative unfolding across the global financial landscape. As fiat currencies face inflationary pressures and traditional investment avenues yield diminishing returns, more and more entities are looking towards alternative assets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and fixed supply, presents a compelling case. BTC AB’s actions serve as a practical demonstration of this shift, providing a real-world example of a company actively executing a dedicated digital asset strategy . Why Are Corporate Bitcoin Holdings on the Rise? The question on many minds is: why are more and more corporations, from tech giants to specialized investment firms like Bitcoin Treasury Capital, choosing to allocate significant portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin? The reasons are multifaceted and often align with long-term strategic goals rather than short-term speculative gains. Here are some key drivers behind the surge in corporate Bitcoin holdings : Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Companies are looking for ways to preserve purchasing power. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury offers a non-correlated asset class that can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns, especially during periods of market volatility in traditional assets. Store of Value: Often dubbed “digital gold,” Bitcoin is increasingly recognized for its properties as a secure, censorship-resistant, and globally transferable store of value, making it ideal for long-term treasury reserves. Future-Proofing: Companies are recognizing the growing importance of digital assets in the global economy. Investing in Bitcoin today can be seen as a forward-thinking move, positioning them for future financial paradigms. Investor Confidence: For publicly traded companies, holding Bitcoin can sometimes signal innovation and a progressive outlook, potentially attracting a new generation of investors interested in the digital economy. This trend isn’t isolated to a few pioneers. Companies across various sectors have begun to embrace Bitcoin. While MicroStrategy remains the most prominent example with its aggressive accumulation strategy, many others have followed suit, albeit with varying degrees of exposure.

This AI chatbot , developed by OpenAI , has not only revolutionized productivity but also sparked intense discussions across industries, including the crypto and tech worlds. Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has experienced an extraordinary ascent, transforming from a novel tool for generating text and code into a behemoth with 300 million weekly active users. Its journey is a testament to the accelerating pace of Generative AI innovation. The Unstoppable Rise of OpenAI’s ChatGPT 2024 proved to be a monumental year for OpenAI , marking significant advancements and strategic partnerships that solidified its position at the forefront of the AI revolution. A standout moment was its collaboration with Apple for Apple Intelligence, integrating its generative AI capabilities into a global ecosystem. The release of GPT-4o, boasting advanced voice capabilities, further showcased the company’s commitment to multimodal AI. Adding to its impressive portfolio, the highly anticipated launch of Sora, a text-to-video model, demonstrated OpenAI’s ambition to push the boundaries of creative AI. The continuous evolution of ChatGPT itself has been central to this growth. From its initial capacity to write essays and code from simple text prompts, the AI chatbot has expanded its utility across countless domains. Its user base has exploded, reflecting the widespread adoption and integration of AI into daily tasks and professional workflows. This rapid expansion highlights the transformative potential of advanced AI models in various sectors, including those touched by blockchain and digital assets. Navigating the Complexities: Challenges and Controversies for OpenAI Despite its successes, OpenAI has not been immune to internal and external pressures. The company faced notable internal drama, including the high-profile exits of key executives like co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and CTO Mira Murati, signaling leadership shifts and strategic realignments. Externally, OpenAI has been embroiled in several legal battles, including lawsuits from Alden Global Capital-owned newspapers alleging copyright infringement, a critical issue for Generative AI models trained on vast datasets. Furthermore, an injunction from Elon Musk sought to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit entity, raising questions about its foundational mission. In 2025, OpenAI continues to battle the perception of ceding ground in the fiercely competitive AI race, particularly to Chinese rivals like DeepSeek. To counter this, the company has been actively shoring up its relationship with Washington, engaging with policymakers on AI regulation and national security. Simultaneously, it is pursuing an ambitious data center project and reportedly laying the groundwork for one of the largest funding rounds in history, underscoring the immense capital required to sustain and accelerate AI development. Revolutionizing Interaction: Key ChatGPT Product Updates and Features The continuous stream of updates to ChatGPT showcases OpenAI ‘s relentless pursuit of innovation. Here’s a look at some of the most impactful developments: July 2025: ChatGPT Agent and Browser Launch: OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Agent, a general-purpose AI agent capable of automating complex computer-based tasks like navigating calendars, drafting presentations, running code, and online shopping within a secure virtual environment. This month also saw reports of OpenAI’s plans to release an AI-powered web browser, aiming to keep user interactions within ChatGPT rather than redirecting to external sites. June 2025: Infrastructure and Model Upgrades: A significant development was OpenAI’s adoption of Google’s AI chips to power ChatGPT, diversifying its hardware reliance beyond Nvidia GPUs. This month also brought the launch of o3-pro, an enhanced reasoning model, and upgrades to ChatGPT’s conversational voice mode, making interactions more natural and fluid. New features for business users, such as meeting recording and connectors for Google Drive and Box, expanded its enterprise utility. May 2025: Hardware Focus and Coding Agents: OpenAI’s CFO Sarah Friar highlighted hardware as a key driver for ChatGPT’s growth, with plans to acquire Jony Ive’s devices startup io for $6.4 billion.

2025-07-18 16:15:19+00:00,Bitcoin Short: The Dangerous 40x Gamble by James Wynn,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Short: The Dangerous 40x Gamble by James Wynn The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with news that has sent ripples through the trading community. Renowned Hyperliquid trader, James Wynn , has made a daring move, opening an astonishing 40x Bitcoin short position. This bold maneuver, reported by Onchain Lens via X, immediately grabbed headlines, sparking intense discussions about market sentiment, risk, and the inherent volatility of digital assets. For anyone deeply invested in the crypto space, understanding the implications of such a high-stakes trade is paramount. What exactly does a 40x Bitcoin short entail, and what could be the potential outcomes for both the trader and the broader market? Understanding the Audacious 40x Bitcoin Short At its core, a Bitcoin short position is a bet against the price of Bitcoin. Traders who short Bitcoin believe its value will decrease, allowing them to profit from the decline. The “40x” part, however, is where the real drama unfolds. This refers to high-leverage trading , meaning James Wynn is using borrowed capital to amplify his potential gains (or losses). For every dollar of his own capital, he’s controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. While this can lead to astronomical profits if the market moves in his favor, it also magnifies the risk of liquidation, where his entire position could be wiped out if Bitcoin’s price moves even slightly against him. Consider this simple example of how leverage works: Without Leverage: If you invest $1,000 and Bitcoin drops 10%, you make $100. With 40x Leverage: If you invest $1,000, you control $40,000 worth of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin drops 10%, your profit is $4,000 (40x $100). However, if Bitcoin rises just 2.5% (100% / 40x), you lose your entire $1,000 initial investment due to liquidation. Who is James Wynn and Why Hyperliquid is His Platform of Choice? James Wynn has gained a reputation within the crypto trading community for his aggressive and often high-conviction trades. His decision to open such a significant position on Hyperliquid is also noteworthy. Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange known for its high liquidity, low fees, and the ability to offer substantial leverage to its users. This platform appeals to experienced traders looking for maximum capital efficiency and fast execution, making it a natural fit for someone like Wynn who is willing to take on significant risk for potentially outsized returns. Hyperliquid’s architecture allows for: Deep Liquidity: Enabling large orders without significant price impact, crucial for large trades like a Bitcoin short . High Leverage Options: Attracting traders aiming for amplified profits, facilitating positions up to 50x or more. Decentralized Nature: Offering a permissionless trading environment, appealing to those who prefer self-custody and transparency. This combination makes Hyperliquid a powerful, albeit risky, playground for seasoned derivatives traders seeking opportunities in high-leverage trading . Navigating Crypto Market Volatility with High Stakes The decision to open a 40x short comes at a time when crypto market volatility remains a constant factor. Bitcoin’s price action has been unpredictable, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and institutional adoption trends. A trader taking such a massive short position likely has a strong conviction about an impending downward movement, perhaps based on technical analysis, on-chain data, or a bearish macro outlook. This highlights the inherent challenge and opportunity within the crypto space: rapid price swings can lead to immense gains or devastating losses, especially when leverage is involved. The market’s unpredictable nature is precisely what makes a 40x Bitcoin short a dangerous gamble. What are the Risks and Rewards of High-Leverage Trading? Engaging in high-leverage trading is a double-edged sword. While the allure of magnified profits is undeniable, the risks are equally amplified. Here’s a breakdown: Aspect Rewards Risks Profit Potential Significant gains from small price movements. Significant losses from small adverse price movements. Capital Efficiency Control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. High risk of liquidation, losing entire collateral. Market Timing Ability to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations. Vulnerable to sudden market whipsaws and flash crashes, especially with high crypto market volatility . Psychological Impact Thrill of high-stakes trading. High stress, emotional decision-making, potential for burnout. The thin margin for error with a 40x position means that even a minor upward price correction in Bitcoin could lead to a rapid and complete loss for James Wynn ‘s position. This is why such trades are often viewed as incredibly risky, even by seasoned professionals. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market Volatility?

Accordingly, Glassnode said that Bitcoin has broken through a significant resistance level around $120,000, with the next target being $136,000.

ETF listing news and SEC case closure drew fresh interest from traders and institutions alike. Price indicators remain bullish, though the current RSI suggests a short break may come first. CRO Holds Above Key Breakout Level Cronos (CRO), the native token of Crypto.com, traded at $0.12 at press time, up 10% over the past 24 hours and 23% in the last week. The price moved above the $0.0986 level, which had held as resistance for several months. CRO now trades within a rising channel, with the next key resistance near $0.18. Interestingly, the token reached a recent high of $0.133 before easing slightly. A pullback to the $0.0986–$0.1060 zone may follow. This area now acts as support and could be retested before the price moves higher. The structure remains bullish as long as this support level holds. Indicators Suggest Trend May Continue The MACD shows a crossover, with the main line above the signal line and a positive histogram. This reflects momentum staying with buyers. The RSI stands at 81, which is above the typical overbought level. A short pause or minor drop may occur as a result.

2025-07-18 16:50:19+00:00,Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: $523 Million Marks Eleventh Consecutive Day of Investor Confidence,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETF Inflows Soar: $523 Million Marks Eleventh Consecutive Day of Investor Confidence The world of cryptocurrency is buzzing with incredible news as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF s continue their impressive run. On July 17, these investment vehicles saw a colossal $523.29 million in total net inflows, marking an astounding eleventh consecutive day of positive movement. This sustained surge isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful testament to growing investor confidence and the increasing mainstream acceptance of digital assets . What’s driving this remarkable streak, and what does it mean for the future of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market? Let’s dive in. Unpacking the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows The daily figures, meticulously tracked and shared by prominent market observers like Trader T on X, paint a vivid picture of robust demand. The $523.29 million recorded on July 17 represents a significant injection of capital, reinforcing a trend that has seen billions flow into these regulated products since their inception. This consistent positive flow is a crucial indicator, suggesting that traditional financial institutions and retail investors alike are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin through these accessible and regulated channels. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s IBIT, which alone accounted for a staggering $497.99 million of the total inflows. This dominant performance by IBIT underscores BlackRock’s significant influence in the institutional investment landscape and its ability to attract substantial capital. While IBIT took the lion’s share, other major players also contributed to the positive momentum, albeit with more modest figures. Here’s a breakdown of the key contributors on July 17: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflow (USD) IBIT BlackRock $497.99M FBTC Fidelity $7.83M BTCO Invesco $7.12M MINI Grayscale $5.27M HODL VanEck $5.08M Other ETFs Various $0 TOTAL $523.29M The fact that several ETFs are consistently seeing inflows, even if BlackRock’s IBIT is dominating, indicates a broad-based interest across different investment platforms. This diversification of inflows across various issuers suggests a healthy, competitive market for these products, offering investors a range of choices within the growing Bitcoin ETF landscape. Why are Spot Bitcoin ETFs So Important for Institutional Adoption? The approval and subsequent performance of spot Bitcoin ETF s in the U.S. marked a watershed moment for the cryptocurrency industry. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which derive their value from Bitcoin futures contracts, spot ETFs hold actual Bitcoin. This direct exposure eliminates complexities and concerns associated with managing private keys, securing digital wallets, and navigating unregulated crypto exchanges, making Bitcoin investment far more accessible and appealing to a wider range of investors, particularly large institutions. For decades, institutional investors have operated within a framework of regulated, transparent, and liquid investment vehicles. Before spot ETFs, gaining exposure to Bitcoin often meant venturing into less regulated or more technically demanding avenues. The advent of spot ETFs changed this dramatically by: Providing Regulatory Clarity: Operating under the watchful eye of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), these ETFs offer a level of regulatory oversight and compliance that many institutional investors require. Enhancing Accessibility: Investors can buy and sell shares of the ETF through traditional brokerage accounts, just like stocks or other conventional funds, removing the need for specialized crypto accounts. Offering Liquidity: ETF shares are traded on major stock exchanges, providing high liquidity and ease of entry and exit for large capital movements. Simplifying Custody: Reputable financial institutions handle the secure custody of the underlying Bitcoin, mitigating the risks associated with self-custody. These factors collectively lower the barrier to entry for substantial capital, paving the way for increased institutional adoption and integrating Bitcoin more deeply into the traditional financial ecosystem. Analyzing the Consistent Crypto Inflows The current streak of eleven consecutive days of positive crypto inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is not merely a statistical anomaly; it reflects a deeper underlying shift in market sentiment and investor behavior. This sustained interest suggests that the initial novelty of these products has given way to a more consistent pattern of capital allocation. Several factors likely contribute to this enduring trend: Macroeconomic Environment: In an era of evolving economic policies and inflationary concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by some as a potential hedge or a valuable alternative asset class.

Simplifying Custody: Reputable financial institutions handle the secure custody of the underlying Bitcoin, mitigating the risks associated with self-custody. These factors collectively lower the barrier to entry for substantial capital, paving the way for increased institutional adoption and integrating Bitcoin more deeply into the traditional financial ecosystem. Analyzing the Consistent Crypto Inflows The current streak of eleven consecutive days of positive crypto inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs is not merely a statistical anomaly; it reflects a deeper underlying shift in market sentiment and investor behavior. This sustained interest suggests that the initial novelty of these products has given way to a more consistent pattern of capital allocation. Several factors likely contribute to this enduring trend: Macroeconomic Environment: In an era of evolving economic policies and inflationary concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by some as a potential hedge or a valuable alternative asset class. Bitcoin Halving Impact: The recent Bitcoin halving event has historically been a catalyst for price appreciation, and investors may be positioning themselves to capitalize on antic"

This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful testament to the growing mainstream adoption, institutional confidence, and relentless innovation within the digital asset space. According to CoinGecko data, this incredible surge highlights a pivotal moment in the financial landscape, signaling a new era for digital currencies. But what does this massive valuation truly signify, and which digital giants are leading the charge? The Unprecedented Rise of the Cryptocurrency Market Cap For years, skeptics questioned the viability of cryptocurrencies, dismissing them as speculative bubbles. Yet, here we are, witnessing the total cryptocurrency market cap not just reaching, but decisively surpassing the $4 trillion mark. This achievement underscores a profound shift in global finance, demonstrating that digital assets are no longer a niche interest but a significant and evolving asset class. This journey from obscurity to a multi-trillion-dollar industry has been fueled by several factors: Increasing Mainstream Acceptance: More businesses, payment processors, and even governments are exploring or integrating crypto. Institutional Influx: Major financial institutions, hedge funds, and corporations are allocating significant capital to digital assets. Technological Innovation: Continuous development in blockchain technology, including decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and Web3 applications, is expanding crypto’s utility. Macroeconomic Factors: As traditional markets face inflation and uncertainty, many view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, as a potential hedge or store of value. This $4 trillion valuation reflects a collective belief in the future of decentralized finance and the underlying technology. It’s a validation of the vision that began with Bitcoin over a decade ago. Decoding Bitcoin’s Dominance: What Drives Its Market Share? At the heart of this colossal market valuation, Bitcoin (BTC) continues to reign supreme, contributing a staggering 59.9% of the total cryptocurrency market cap . This substantial Bitcoin market share solidifies its position as the undisputed king of crypto. But why does Bitcoin command such a significant portion of the market? Bitcoin’s dominance stems from a combination of factors: First-Mover Advantage: As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin enjoys unparalleled brand recognition and trust. “Digital Gold” Narrative: Many investors view Bitcoin as a store of value, akin to digital gold, especially in times of economic uncertainty. Its finite supply (21 million coins) contributes to this scarcity narrative. Institutional Adoption: The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs in major markets has opened doors for traditional investors to gain exposure, significantly boosting its liquidity and perceived legitimacy. Network Effect: Bitcoin boasts the largest and most secure blockchain network, with a vast ecosystem of miners, developers, and users. Halving Cycles: The periodic halving events, which reduce the supply of new Bitcoins, historically lead to price appreciation, further reinforcing its value proposition. The consistent strength of Bitcoin’s market share acts as a barometer for the health of the broader crypto market. Its movements often dictate the overall sentiment, with a strong BTC performance frequently paving the way for altcoin rallies. Ethereum’s Ascent: How Does Its Market Share Impact the Ecosystem? While Bitcoin holds the lion’s share, Ethereum (ETH) stands as the second most influential cryptocurrency, accounting for a significant 10.7% of the total cryptocurrency market cap . Ethereum’s role extends far beyond just a digital currency; it is the foundational layer for the vast majority of the decentralized web. Its substantial Ethereum market share is a direct reflection of its utility and innovation. Ethereum’s impact on the crypto ecosystem is profound due to: Smart Contract Functionality: Ethereum pioneered smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. This innovation enabled the creation of decentralized applications (dApps). DeFi Hub: The vast majority of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, which aim to replicate traditional financial services without intermediaries, are built on Ethereum.

In a statement, BitMine says it has accumulated over $1 billion worth of the second-largest crypto asset by market cap just days after closing a $250 million private placement to support its Ethereum treasury strategy. The company’s newly appointed chairman of the board of directors, Fundstrat’s Thomas Lee, says that BitMine is well on its way to achieving its goal of acquiring and staking 5% of the total supply of ETH. According to Lee, BitMine seeks to become the MicroStrategy of Ethereum. The software company now known as Strategy already holds 601,000 BTC worth about $72 billion, or around 2.865% of the total supply of the flagship crypto asset. “Among Bitcoin treasury companies, we have witnessed the reflexive benefit of acquiring large holdings… Such sizable holdings have created a ‘sovereign put’ for the company, meaning a nation-state views MSTR holdings as attractive if a nation ever wanted to acquire 5% of the Bitcoin network. Similarly, ETH Treasuries, which accumulate 5% of ETH supply, can benefit from a similar ‘Wall Street put.''” BitMines aims to increase the amount of ETH held per share by reinvesting the company’s cash flows as well as through capital markets activities, staking yields and changes in the value of the crypto asset.

2025-07-18 17:00:17+00:00,Ethereum ETF: BlackRock’s ETHA Records Unprecedented $544.94M Inflow,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum ETF: BlackRock’s ETHA Records Unprecedented $544.94M Inflow The world of digital assets is buzzing with excitement as institutional interest continues to surge, and a recent development involving BlackRock’s spot Ethereum (ETH) ETF, ETHA, has sent ripples across the market. On July 17, this groundbreaking financial product achieved an all-time high net inflow of a staggering $544.94 million, as reported by Trader T on X. This monumental achievement not only shattered its own previous record set just a day earlier on July 16, which stood at $489.14 million, but also underscored a growing appetite among traditional investors for exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency. What does this unprecedented ETH inflow signify for the future of crypto, and why is the BlackRock ETHA ETF at the center of this financial revolution? Understanding the Phenomenon: What is a Spot Ethereum ETF? Before diving deeper into the implications of BlackRock’s record-breaking success, it’s crucial to grasp what a Spot Ethereum ETF entails. An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund that trades on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A spot crypto ETF, specifically, holds the underlying cryptocurrency directly, rather than derivatives or futures contracts. This means that when you invest in the BlackRock ETHA ETF , you are essentially gaining exposure to the actual price movements of Ethereum without having to directly buy, store, or manage the digital asset yourself. This offers several key advantages: Accessibility: It opens up the crypto market to a wider range of traditional investors and institutions who might be hesitant to navigate the complexities of crypto exchanges and wallets. Security: The ETF provider handles the secure custody of the underlying ETH, alleviating concerns about hacks or lost private keys for individual investors. Liquidity: ETFs trade on regulated exchanges, providing high liquidity and ease of buying and selling throughout the trading day. Regulatory Clarity: For many institutional investors, investing through a regulated ETF structure provides the necessary compliance framework they require. The approval and launch of such products, especially from a financial giant like BlackRock, are often seen as a significant step towards mainstream adoption and legitimization of cryptocurrencies. The Numbers Speak: BlackRock ETHA ETF’s Soaring Inflows The recent figures for the BlackRock ETHA ETF are truly eye-opening. Let’s look at the rapid acceleration of inflows: BlackRock ETHA ETF Daily Net Inflows Date Net Inflow (USD) Notes July 16 $489.14 million Previous all-time high July 17 $544.94 million New all-time high This consistent upward trend in ETH inflow demonstrates a robust and growing demand. It’s not just a one-off spike but a sustained interest that indicates a deeper shift in investment strategies. Such significant capital allocation into a crypto-backed product from a firm of BlackRock’s stature sends a powerful signal to the global financial community. What’s Fueling This Massive ETH Inflow? Several factors likely contribute to the surging interest in the Ethereum ETF and the subsequent record inflows: Growing Institutional Confidence: As the crypto market matures and regulatory frameworks become clearer, more traditional financial institutions are gaining confidence in digital assets. BlackRock’s entry into the space provides a stamp of approval that resonates with other large players. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Strength: Ethereum remains the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps). Its ongoing development, including the transition to Proof-of-Stake and upcoming upgrades, makes it an attractive long-term investment for those seeking exposure to innovation. Diversification from Bitcoin: While Bitcoin ETFs have seen immense success, investors are increasingly looking to diversify their crypto exposure beyond just Bitcoin. Ethereum, with its unique utility and market dominance, presents a compelling alternative. Market Momentum: A general positive sentiment in the broader crypto market, often driven by Bitcoin’s performance, tends to spill over into other major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, attracting new capital. Ease of Investment: The simplicity of investing in an ETF compared to direct crypto purchases, coupled with the familiarity of traditional brokerage accounts, lowers the barrier to entry for many institutional and retail investors.

2025-07-18 17:15:19+00:00,Crucial CFTC Confirmation: What Brian Quintenz’s Vote Means for Crypto Regulation,"BitcoinWorld Crucial CFTC Confirmation: What Brian Quintenz’s Vote Means for Crypto Regulation The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation as a pivotal moment approaches for U.S. crypto regulation. Next Monday, the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee is set to cast its vote on the CFTC Confirmation of Brian Quintenz as the next chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This isn’t just another bureaucratic procedure; it’s a critical decision that could significantly shape the future of digital assets in America. As reported by Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, on X, this vote follows his confirmation hearing last month, and the implications for the crypto industry are immense. Understanding the Significance of CFTC Confirmation Why is the confirmation of a CFTC chairman such a big deal for those of us navigating the digital asset landscape? The CFTC plays a vital role in overseeing commodity markets, and increasingly, that includes various cryptocurrencies. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) often grabs headlines for its actions against crypto projects deemed securities, the CFTC has consistently asserted its jurisdiction over digital assets classified as commodities, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. A confirmed chairman brings stability, clear direction, and potentially a more defined regulatory stance, which is something the crypto industry has long craved. The absence of a permanent, confirmed leader can lead to policy stagnation and uncertainty. For an industry as dynamic and rapidly evolving as crypto, clarity is paramount. This vote is about more than just filling a seat; it’s about setting the tone for how the U.S. government intends to supervise and interact with the burgeoning digital economy. Who is Brian Quintenz and What Does His Potential Role as Brian Quintenz CFTC Chairman Mean? Brian Quintenz is no stranger to the CFTC or the world of digital assets. He previously served as a Commissioner at the CFTC from 2017 to 2021, a period during which the agency began to significantly engage with cryptocurrencies. During his tenure, Quintenz was often viewed as a pragmatic voice, advocating for regulatory clarity while acknowledging the innovative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. His past statements and actions suggest a nuanced approach to Brian Quintenz CFTC leadership. He has emphasized the importance of ensuring market integrity and protecting consumers, but also expressed a desire to avoid stifling innovation through overly burdensome regulations. For example, he has often highlighted the need for a principles-based approach rather than a rigid rulebook, which could offer flexibility for new technologies to flourish. His potential chairmanship could signal a continued emphasis on treating certain cryptocurrencies as commodities, potentially paving the way for more tailored regulatory frameworks. Key Aspects of Quintenz’s Stance: Innovation-Friendly: Generally seen as supportive of technological advancement in financial markets. Regulatory Clarity: Advocates for clear rules of the road for market participants. Commodity Focus: Tends to view Bitcoin and certain other digital assets as commodities, falling under CFTC purview. Market Integrity: Prioritizes robust market oversight to prevent manipulation and ensure fair trading. Navigating the Labyrinth of Crypto Regulation US The United States has famously struggled to establish a unified and comprehensive framework for Crypto Regulation US . This fragmented approach has often left businesses and investors in a state of limbo, unsure which rules apply to them. The primary players in this regulatory dance are the CFTC and the SEC, each with distinct mandates: Regulatory Body Primary Jurisdiction Role in Crypto Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commodity derivatives markets Oversees digital assets deemed as commodities (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum futures); aims to prevent fraud and manipulation in these markets. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Securities markets Oversees digital assets deemed as securities (e.g., many ICO tokens); focuses on investor protection and disclosure requirements. This dual-agency approach, while necessary given their distinct legal mandates, has often led to a lack of coordinated policy and enforcement. A strong, confirmed CFTC chairman, especially one with prior experience and a clear vision for crypto, could provide much-needed leadership and potentially foster greater inter-agency cooperation. This is crucial for the development of a coherent and effective regulatory framework that supports both innovation and investor protection. The Broader Implications for Digital Asset Oversight The outcome of this vote will have significant implications for Digital Asset Oversight . If Brian Quintenz is confirmed, his leadership could influence several key areas: 1.

The absence of a permanent, confirmed leader can lead to policy stagnation and uncertainty. For an industry as dynamic and rapidly evolving as crypto, clarity is paramount. This vote is about more than just filling a seat; it’s about setting the tone for how the U.S. government intends to supervise and interact with the burgeoning digital economy. Who is Brian Quintenz and What Does His Potential Role as Brian Quintenz CFTC Chairman Mean? Brian Quintenz is no stranger to the CFTC or the world of digital assets. He previously served as a Commissioner at the CFTC from 2017 to 2021, a period during which the agency began to significantly engage with cryptocurrencies. During his tenure, Quintenz was often viewed as a pragmatic voice, advocating for regulatory clarity while acknowledging the innovative potential of blockchain technology and digital assets. His past statements and actions suggest a nuanced approach to Brian Quintenz CFTC leadership. He has emphasized the importance of ensuring market integrity and protecting consumers, but also expressed a desire to avoid stifling innovation through overly burdensome regulations. For example, he has often highlighted the need for a principles-based approach rather than a rigid rulebook, which could offer flexibility for new technologies to flourish. His potential chairmanship could signal a continued emphasis on treating certain cryptocurrencies as commodities, potentially paving the way for more tailored regulatory frameworks. Key Aspects of Quintenz’s Stance: Innovation-Friendly: Generally seen as supportive of technological advancement in financial markets. Regulatory Clarity: Advocates for clear rules of the road for market participants. Commodity Focus: Tends to view Bitcoin and certain other digital assets as commodities, falling under CFTC purview. Market Integrity: Prioritizes robust market oversight to prevent manipulation and ensure fair trading. Navigating the Labyrinth of Crypto Regulation US The United States has famously struggled to establish a unified and comprehensive framework for Crypto Regulation US . This fragmented approach has often left businesses and investors in a state of limbo, unsure which rules apply to them. The primary players in this regulatory dance are the CFTC and the SEC, each with distinct mandates: Regulatory Body Primary Jurisdiction Role in Crypto Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Commodity derivatives markets Oversees digital assets deemed as commodities (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum futures); aims to prevent fraud and manipulation in these markets. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Securities markets Oversees digital assets deemed as securities (e.g., many ICO tokens); focuses on investor protection and disclosure requirements. This dual-agency approach, while necessary given their distinct legal mandates, has often led to a lack of coordinated policy and enforcement. A strong, confirmed CFTC chairman, especially one with prior experience and a clear vision for crypto, could provide much-needed leadership and potentially foster greater inter-agency cooperation. This is crucial for the development of a coherent and effective regulatory framework that supports both innovation and investor protection. The Broader Implications for Digital Asset Oversight The outcome of this vote will have significant implications for Digital Asset Oversight . If Brian Quintenz is confirmed, his leadership could influence several key areas: 1. Market Integrity and Consumer Protection: The CFTC’s core mission includes"

The company has recently announced it has formed a merger with Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO), a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). The SPAC deal was formally signed on July 16. Once the deal closes, the new company will trade on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol BSTR. BSTR aims to build one of the biggest company-owned Bitcoin treasuries in the world. A Public Debut Backed by Major Bitcoin Holdings The merger is accompanied by a robust and well-planned funding structure that provides BSTR with a solid foundation in the public markets. When it launches, BSTR plans to hold 30,021 Bitcoin and raise to $1.5 billion in fiat-based private investment in public equity (PIPE) financing. This funding is set to come through a mix of equity, convertible securities, and direct Bitcoin contributions. These contributions will be made by trusted backers and founding shareholders advised by Blockstream Capital Partners. Additionally, CEPO’s trust account may contribute up to $200 million, contingent upon shareholder redemptions. This combined funding and Bitcoin holdings will place BSTR among the top four largest public corporate Bitcoin treasuries. It will rank just ahead of Metaplanet. Pioneers to Lead BSTR’s Treasury Vision Adam Back, a key figure in BTC history and co-founder of Blockstream, will serve as Chief Executive Officer. Back is recognized for creating Hashcash, the proof-of-work system referenced in Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin white paper. Sean Bill, a veteran in institutional crypto investment, will also serve as Chief Investment Officer. He is known for supporting one of the first Bitcoin allocations by a U.S. public pension fund and has experience integrating digital assets into large portfolios. Together, Back and Bill will guide BSTR to build a Bitcoin-centric treasury company that does more than hold digital assets. The company’s strategy involves building up its BTC holdings and also earning returns in Bitcoin. It also plans to offer advice to companies and governments that want to manage their treasuries using Bitcoin as a unit of account. The company will measure performance in BTC per share, rather than focusing on traditional fiat terms. Traditional Finance Meets the BTC Economy The announcement confirms previous reports that Cantor Fitzgerald had been involved in discussions to acquire over $3 billion in Bitcoin from Blockstream . Furthermore, the merger has received approval from both the BSTR and CEPO boards. The merger has received approval from both the BSTR and CEPO boards. To be finalized, it must also gain approval from CEPO shareholders and meet other standard conditions. CEPO will soon file the necessary documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

2025-07-18 17:30:21+00:00,Unlocking Potential: Cointelegraph Predicts Epic Altcoin Season Ahead,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking Potential: Cointelegraph Predicts Epic Altcoin Season Ahead Are you ready for the next big wave in the crypto world? For months, Bitcoin has dominated headlines, but a compelling new report from Cointelegraph suggests a significant shift is on the horizon. Get ready to explore the highly anticipated Altcoin Season , a period where digital assets beyond Bitcoin could see explosive growth and reshape your portfolio. What is Altcoin Season and Why Does it Matter for Your Portfolio? The term ‘ Altcoin Season ‘ is a widely discussed phenomenon in the cryptocurrency space, referring to a period when alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) significantly outperform Bitcoin. While Bitcoin often leads market rallies, its dominance typically gives way to altcoins once it consolidates or experiences reduced volatility. This capital rotation allows investors to seek higher returns in the more volatile, yet potentially more rewarding, altcoin market. Historically, an altcoin season typically unfolds in stages: first, Bitcoin experiences a strong rally, attracting new capital into the crypto ecosystem. After Bitcoin’s initial surge, its price stabilizes, and investors begin to reallocate profits or new capital into larger-cap altcoins, then mid-cap altcoins, and finally, smaller, more speculative projects. This cascading effect can lead to parabolic gains across a wide range of digital assets. Why does this matter to you? Because identifying and participating in an altcoin season can offer unparalleled opportunities for portfolio growth. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a larger market capitalization and tends to move slower, many altcoins, especially those with smaller market caps, can experience percentage gains that are several multiples higher during these periods. This is the time when strategic diversification and keen market observation can truly pay off. The Crucial $1.5 Trillion Crypto Market Cap Milestone: What Does it Mean? According to the latest Cointelegraph Report , the total crypto market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin, has now reached a significant milestone: $1.5 trillion. This figure is not just a number; it represents a critical resistance line that was last tested in January of this year. Breaking through such a formidable resistance level is a strong bullish signal for the broader altcoin market. A resistance line acts as a ceiling for prices, where selling pressure has historically prevented further upward movement. When this barrier is breached, it often indicates a fundamental shift in market sentiment and buying pressure, paving the way for further gains. The fact that the altcoin market has re-approached and potentially surpassed this level suggests renewed confidence and increasing capital inflows. Furthermore, the publication explained that this market cap is expected to surpass its all-time high of $1.72 trillion in the long term. Reaching and exceeding this previous peak would not only confirm the bullish trend but also signal a new phase of expansion for altcoins, potentially leading to unprecedented valuations for many projects. This upward trajectory suggests a maturing market, attracting both retail and institutional interest beyond Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s Shifting Dynamics: The Impact of Decreasing Bitcoin Whale Deposits One of the key indicators signaling the potential for an altcoin rally is the changing behavior of Bitcoin whales. The Cointelegraph Report highlights that Bitcoin Whale Deposits on exchanges are decreasing, alongside a reduction in Bitcoin selling pressure. This trend is crucial for understanding capital flow within the crypto market. When Bitcoin whales (large holders of BTC) deposit their holdings onto exchanges, it often signifies an intention to sell, which increases selling pressure and can lead to price declines. Conversely, a decrease in these deposits suggests that whales are either holding onto their Bitcoin or moving it off exchanges into cold storage, indicating a long-term bullish outlook or a lack of immediate selling intent. This reduction in selling pressure creates a more stable environment for Bitcoin, allowing capital to seek opportunities elsewhere. This dynamic is often referred to as ‘capital rotation.’ As Bitcoin stabilizes or experiences slower growth after its initial run, large investors and traders begin to look for assets with higher growth potential. This capital then flows into altcoins, driving up their prices. The reduced selling pressure on Bitcoin effectively ‘frees up’ liquidity and attention, directing it towards the diverse and innovative altcoin ecosystem. It’s a natural progression in the crypto market cycle, and the current signals strongly point towards this rotation favoring altcoins.

2025-07-18 17:30:39+00:00,SharpLink Gaming To Buy $5 Billion In Ethereum: Supply Shock Incoming?,"Ethereum is undergoing a bullish expansion, pushing above the $2,650 level and holding support above $2,600—a move that reinforces investor confidence across the broader crypto market. As ETH shows signs of sustained strength, institutional interest is ramping up. On Thursday, SharpLink Gaming (Nasdaq: SBET) made headlines by deepening its commitment to Ethereum. In a prospectus supplement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company revealed it has raised the ceiling on the amount of common stock it can sell from $1 billion to $5 billion. This strategic move is part of SharpLink’s treasury plan centered on accumulating ETH, making it one of the first Nasdaq-listed companies to adopt such a bold Ethereum-focused financial strategy publicly. The news arrives as ETH continues to lead altcoins in recovery, outperforming major peers with growing volume and strong technical momentum. Ethereum’s network fundamentals and price action are aligning with an expanding institutional narrative. As traditional companies like SharpLink integrate ETH into their balance sheets, the stage could be set for a broader wave of corporate crypto adoption, especially if Ethereum maintains its hold above current levels and confirms a bullish macro trend. SharpLink Becomes Largest Corporate Holder Of Ethereum SharpLink Gaming has officially become the largest corporate holder of Ethereum. In its latest prospectus supplement filed with the US SEC on July 17, 2025, the company confirmed that it has increased the total amount of common stock it may sell under its Sales Agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners to $6 billion. This figure includes the initial $1 billion under the May 30 prospectus and an additional $5 billion authorized by the recent supplement. These proceeds are being directed to Ethereum purchases as part of SharpLink’s crypto treasury strategy. As of today, the company holds 280,706 ETH—valued at approximately $1 billion—on its balance sheet. This bold allocation not only positions SharpLink as a pioneer in corporate Ethereum adoption but also places significant upward pressure on ETH’s long-term scarcity. At current issuance rates, it would take the Ethereum network approximately 2.5 years to produce 1,436,000 ETH—the equivalent volume SharpLink could accumulate if the full $6 billion were converted into ETH at today’s prices. This aggressive strategy signals growing confidence in Ethereum’s role as a long-term store of value and infrastructure for Web3. It could also mark a turning point in corporate crypto accumulation beyond Bitcoin. ETH Price Action Details: Key Levels To Watch Ethereum (ETH) is showcasing a powerful bullish structure on the daily chart, surging to $3,606.38 with a 3.64% gain on the day. After breaking through the long-standing resistance around $2,850, ETH confirmed the breakout with strong volume, suggesting conviction behind the move. Price is now significantly above the 50, 100, and 200-day simple moving averages—currently at $2,640, $2,359, and $2,475, respectively, indicating a full bullish trend alignment across timeframes. The chart shows a clear breakout from a consolidation phase that lasted for several weeks. Once ETH reclaimed $2,850 and flipped it into support, momentum accelerated. Since then, ETH has printed several large-bodied candles with minimal wicks, a sign of aggressive buying. Volume has surged in recent days, reinforcing the strength of this rally. The current price action suggests a market driven by institutional participation, likely influenced by macro developments like ETF inflows and regulatory clarity in the US.

2025-07-18 17:45:15+00:00,Bitcoin Miners Unleash Massive BTC Selling: What This Means for the Market,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Miners Unleash Massive BTC Selling: What This Means for the Market The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing with activity, and if you’re keeping an eye on Bitcoin , you’ve probably heard about the recent surge in selling activity from a crucial segment of the ecosystem: Bitcoin miners . This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a significant wave that has caught the attention of analysts and investors alike. Understanding why miners are selling and what it implies is key to navigating the current crypto landscape. What’s Behind the Surge in BTC Selling Volume? Recently, a report from the reputable on-chain data analytics platform, CryptoQuant, shed light on a remarkable development: BTC selling volume from miners has reached its highest point since April. Imagine a massive outflow of 16,000 BTC, making its way from miner wallets primarily to exchanges. This isn’t a small sum; it represents a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s daily trading volume and liquidity. CryptoQuant noted that this significant transfer occurred precisely as Bitcoin was achieving a new local high, a crucial detail that hints at the motivations behind these sales. Why Are Bitcoin Miners Selling Now? A Deep Dive into Their Motivations Miners are the backbone of the Bitcoin network, responsible for validating transactions and securing the blockchain. Their operations are capital-intensive, requiring significant investment in hardware, electricity, and infrastructure. So, when we see a spike in their selling activity, it’s worth asking: what’s driving this decision? Profit-Taking at Local Highs: One of the most straightforward reasons is profit realization. As Bitcoin reached a new high, it presented an opportune moment for miners to cash in on their accumulated BTC. This allows them to secure profits, especially those who have been HODLing through market fluctuations. Operational Costs and Upgrades: Mining is an expensive business. Miners constantly need to cover electricity bills, maintenance, and the costs of upgrading their hardware to remain competitive. Selling BTC is their primary way to fund these ongoing expenses. A large outflow could indicate a need to cover significant operational costs or to invest in newer, more efficient mining rigs. Pre-Halving Preparations: Although the most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in April 2024, miners often prepare for such events well in advance or adjust their strategies in the months following. A reduction in block rewards means less BTC earned per block, pushing miners to optimize their finances and potentially sell off existing holdings to ensure liquidity for future operations. Market Sentiment and Risk Management: Miners, like other large holders, also react to broader market sentiment. If there’s uncertainty or a perception that the market might pull back after hitting a high, selling some holdings can be a form of risk management to protect against potential future price declines. The Power of On-Chain Analytics: Unpacking Miner Behavior This entire insight into miner selling wouldn’t be possible without on-chain analytics . Platforms like CryptoQuant provide invaluable transparency into the blockchain, allowing us to observe the flow of assets in real-time. By tracking wallet movements, exchange inflows/outflows, and specific entity behaviors (like miners), analysts can gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics that are otherwise opaque. Consider the benefits of such data: Early Warning Signals: Large miner outflows to exchanges can sometimes precede increased selling pressure in the market. While not always indicative of a price crash, it’s a signal worth monitoring. Understanding Supply Dynamics: Knowing how much BTC miners are holding or selling helps in assessing the potential supply coming onto the market, which directly impacts liquidity and price. Revealing Market Psychology: Miner behavior often reflects their outlook on Bitcoin’s future price. Their willingness to sell at certain levels provides insights into their collective sentiment and financial strategies. Without these sophisticated tools, much of the inner workings of the crypto market would remain a mystery, making informed decision-making significantly harder for both retail and institutional investors. What is the Bitcoin Price Impact of Such Selling? When a significant amount of BTC moves to exchanges, it typically indicates an intent to sell. This increased supply on exchanges, if met with insufficient buying demand, can exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price impact . While 16,000 BTC is a large sum, the overall market liquidity for Bitcoin is also substantial, especially during bull markets. Historically, miner selling can contribute to short-term price corrections or consolidate price action. However, it’s crucial to remember that miner selling is just one of many factors influencing Bitcoin’s price.

As Bitcoin reached a new high, it presented an opportune moment for miners to cash in on their accumulated BTC. This allows them to secure profits, especially those who have been HODLing through market fluctuations. Operational Costs and Upgrades: Mining is an expensive business. Miners constantly need to cover electricity bills, maintenance, and the costs of upgrading their hardware to remain competitive. Selling BTC is their primary way to fund these ongoing expenses. A large outflow could indicate a need to cover significant operational costs or to invest in newer, more efficient mining rigs. Pre-Halving Preparations: Although the most recent Bitcoin halving occurred in April 2024, miners often prepare for such events well in advance or adjust their strategies in the months following. A reduction in block rewards means less BTC earned per block, pushing miners to optimize their finances and potentially sell off existing holdings to ensure liquidity for future operations. Market Sentiment and Risk Management: Miners, like other large holders, also react to broader market sentiment. If there’s uncertainty or a perception that the market might pull back after hitting a high, selling some holdings can be a form of risk management to protect against potential future price declines. The Power of On-Chain Analytics: Unpacking Miner Behavior This entire insight into miner selling wouldn’t be possible without on-chain analytics . Platforms like CryptoQuant provide invaluable transparency into the blockchain, allowing us to observe the flow of assets in real-time. By tracking wallet movements, exchange inflows/outflows, and specific entity behaviors (like miners), analysts can gain a deeper understanding of market dynamics that are otherwise opaque. Consider the benefits of such data: Early Warning Signals: Large miner outflows to exchanges can sometimes precede increased selling pressure in the market. While not always indicative of a price crash, it’s a signal worth monitoring. Understanding Supply Dynamics: Knowing how much BTC miners are holding or selling helps in assessing the potential supply coming onto the market, which directly impacts liquidity and price. Revealing Market Psychology: Miner behavior often reflects their outlook on Bitcoin’s future price. Their willingness to sell at certain levels provides insights into their collective sentiment and financial strategies. Without these sophisticated tools, much of the inner workings of the crypto market would remain a mystery, making informed decision-making significantly harder for both retail and institutional investors. What is the Bitcoin Price Impact of Such Selling? When a significant amount of BTC moves to exchanges, it typically indicates an intent to sell. This increased supply on exchanges, if met with insufficient buying demand, can exert downward pressure on the Bitcoin price impact . While 16,000 BTC is a large sum, the overall market liquidity for Bitcoin is also substantial, especially during bull markets. Historically, miner selling can contribute to short-term price corrections or consolidate price action. However, it’s crucial to remember that miner selling is just one of many factors influencing Bitcoin’s price. Institutional buying, macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and retail investor sentimen"

2025-07-18 17:50:03+00:00,Charles Schwab is set to begin spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading,"Charles Schwab, the US brokerage firm with $10.7 trillion under management, is set to roll out spot Bitcoin and Ethereum trading. According to the company’s CEO, Rick Wurster, both BTC and ETH will become meaningful long-term growth drivers for the company. Wurster initially revealed Schwab’s plans to start spot crypto trading last November and reiterated the plans in the firm’s Spring 2025 Business Update. At the time, he said that the deployment would depend on a better regulatory environment in the US. “Our expectation is that with the changing regulatory environment, we are hopeful and likely to be able to launch direct spot crypto and our goal is to do that in the next 12 months and we’re on a great path to be able to do that,” Wurster said. In addition to trading services, Wurster revealed that Schwab plans to launch a stablecoin. He said the firm is exploring multiple pathways to deliver this stablecoin. This suggests openness to partnerships, in-house development, or leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure. “Stablecoins are likely to play a role in transacting on blockchains, and that’s something we do want to be able to offer,” he said. “We will have a stablecoin at some point.” The statement comes after the GENIUS Act, which is meant to regulate stablecoins, was passed on Thursday by the US House. Spot crypto trading volume dropped in Q2 Charles Schwab’s interest in crypto trading comes as spot crypto volume fell by 22% in the second quarter of 2025. Crypto spot trading volumes on major centralized exchanges (CEXs) fell from $5.3 trillion in Q4 2024 to $4.6 trillion in Q1 2025 and then fell even more to $3.6 trillion in Q2, according to data from TokenInsight. Crypto spot trading volume across major CEXs versus the price of Bitcoin. Source: TokenInsight Bitcoin’s price increased significantly in Q2, reaching 25% gain. This was due to inflows into Bitcoin funds and more companies using it. This is a big change from the 12% drop in Q1. However, Bitcoin dominance, at the same time, dropped by 4.36% over the past week to 61.84%. Meanwhile, Ether spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds saw their most significant daily net inflow on Wednesday, totaling $726.74 million. The inflows were led by $499 million into BlackRock’s ETHA, with eight out of nine ether funds reporting positive daily flows. Following the news today, Charles Schwab will join the London-based international banking group Standard Chartered, which launched a US dollar-paired Bitcoin and Ether spot trading service for institutional clients this week, including corporates, investors, and asset managers. Charles Schwab benefited from Trump’s tariffs Charles Schwab also revealed today that it benefited from a surge in trading activity around President Trump’s tariffs. The brokerage’s profits rose 60% in the quarter compared to a year ago. Also, late-quarter market bounce not only increased the amount of money that brokerages managed, but it also allowed companies like Schwab to charge higher fees. Schwab posted adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 while total client assets climbed 14% to $10.76 trillion. According to a statement, this is in comparison to the same period last year. Revenue from client trades also jumped 23% to $952 million. For the three months ending June 30, Charles Schwab made $2.13 billion, or $1.08 per share. This is in comparison to the $1.33 billion, or 66 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Daily average revenue trades just barely beat analysts’ expectations at 7.57 million.

Yesterday, on a vote of 206-102, the Republican-led U.S. House passed the GENIUS Act, sending the country’s first crypto-specific regulations bill to the desk of the sitting President. GENIUS is an acronym meaning “Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins.” The bill purports to seek to improve consumer protection, transparency, marketing restrictions and regulatory oversight for the burgeoning stablecoin market, estimated to be worth $250 billion. Furthermore, the House passed the CLARITY and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Acts by similar margins, sending both bills to the Senate for further consideration. The CLARITY Act seeks to establish a clear regulation framework for crypto and other digital assets. The Anti-CBDC Act would prohibit Fed banks from issuing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Though the GENIUS Act easily passed the House, prominent Republican Senator Josh Hawley has been vocal and adamant in breaking party lines on the bill, urging his fellow Republicans to vote against it. “It’s a huge giveaway to Big Tech. It allows these tech companies to issue stablecoins without any kind of controls. I don’t see why we would do that.” Trump is expected to sign the GENIUS Act into law soon.

BTC’s presence at the institutional level has seen sharp growth as publicly traded companies acquire the crypto king at a massive scale. Public Companies Embrace Bitcoin Strategy Bitcoin has evolved from a mere digital asset to a highly sought-after mainstream asset in the cryptocurrency and financial sectors. Presently, BTC is taking over the spotlight as many well-known publicly traded companies have shown significant interest in the flagship asset. What was previously the purview of early adopters and tech-savvy investors is now being adopted by corporate giants in an effort to gain a strategic advantage in the rapidly changing financial world. Brian Harrod of The Harrod Report has taken to the X platform to outline the number of public companies holding BTC in large chunks. In the X post, Harrod shared a report from Bitwise , a leading asset manager, which shows that publicly traded companies that have now added BTC to their holdings have reached a total of 125. This growing wave of institutional adoption reflects a robust conviction in the crypto king, as businesses view BTC not just as a speculative asset, but a hedge against inflation and global printing . Data shows that these prominent corporate firms have accumulated a cumulative supply of 847,000 BTC, valued at approximately $91 billion at current price levels. The significant accumulation of these companies underscores the expanding role of institutions in the broader market. BTC’s price has responded notably to the ongoing development, surging to a new all-time high. According to Harrod, analysts believe that this rising demand among corporate giants , coupled with a more transparent regulatory environment, has been the main driver of BTC’s latest leg up. However, they also warned that the sharp price movements still present hazards for novice investors. With many companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets, the flagship asset’s price and its market value have increased sharply, surpassing that of Amazon. BTC is now ranked the fifth-largest asset behind Gold, NVIDIA, Apple, and Microsoft, in the world by market cap after dethroning Amazon. Strategy Still Leading The Charge The chart shows that Michael Saylor’s Strategy is still leading the charge, followed by MARA Holdings, Twenty One, Riot Platforms, and Mateplanet. Strategy’s position at the top underscores the company’s unwavering trust in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

Bailey’s fund has outperformed Bitcoin itself, solidifying his role as one of crypto’s most influential behind-the-scenes operators. The gains stem from a strategy of investing in public companies across multiple sectors and getting them to convert into “Bitcoin proxies” by adding the digital currency to their treasuries. As of June 30, 210k Capital managed $433 million in assets. 210k capital turns businesses into Bitcoin proxies Rather than merely holding tokens or investing in crypto-native firms, 210k Capital targets small-cap public companies and works closely with them to adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies. This tactic helped them capitalize on a post-election surge in crypto markets, driven by Trump’s pro-industry platform. One such example is The Smarter Web Plc, a UK-based website design firm that completed an IPO on London’s Aquis Stock Exchange in April. After raising £2.1 million to buy Bitcoin, its shares rocketed. 210k Capital’s £780,000 stake from the pre-IPO round — including stock warrants — is now valued at nearly £110 million, Bloomberg reports . The company has since amassed 1,600 BTC, worth over $190 million. But Smarter Web also illustrates the volatility of such plays. The stock is down 55% from its June 20 peak, showing how susceptible these firms remain to swings in crypto sentiment and thin trading volumes. Another big winner is Metaplanet , a hotel chain in Japan that rebranded itself to acquire and hold Bitcoin. 210k Capital bought $1 million worth of stock warrants before the pivot. That stake is now worth over $106 million, according to the fund’s Managing Partner, Tyler Evans. Bailey is a political catalyst with financial muscle The investment strategy dovetails with Bailey’s political work. As co-founder of BTC Inc., he organized key Bitcoin conferences and played a role in shaping Trump’s pivot from crypto skeptic to vocal champion. At the 2024 Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Trump declared his ambition to make the U.S. “the world’s crypto capital” and named Bailey as a central figure in that transformation. BTC Inc. also hosted the “Inaugural Crypto Ball” in January 2025 to celebrate Trump’s return to the White House. Bailey later joined the advisory board of Metaplanet, along with Trump’s son Eric. The fusion of politics and profit is by no means accidental. Bailey urged crypto supporters to raise $100 million for Trump’s campaign, and the move appears to be genius in hindsight, based on the administration’s pro-Bitcoin agenda and his fund’s role in transforming companies into policy-aligned investment vehicles. His other venture, Nakamoto Holdings Inc ., a Bitcoin treasury company named after Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder, announced a merger in May with healthcare firm KindlyMD, which is raising funds to buy Bitcoin for its treasury. While Bailey’s approach has yielded relatively high returns, it comes with caveats. Companies accumulating crypto have seen shares spike, but they’ve also faced massive drawdowns. For example, SharpLink Gaming shares, an Ether-focused treasury play, fell 70% after what its chairman described as a routine filing. Still, 210k Capital isn’t backing off.

2025-07-18 19:10:24+00:00,El Salvador Bitcoin: Unveiling the Crucial IMF Loan Contradiction,"BitcoinWorld El Salvador Bitcoin: Unveiling the Crucial IMF Loan Contradiction Are you following the unfolding drama surrounding El Salvador’s bold embrace of Bitcoin? The nation that first adopted Bitcoin as legal tender is now at the center of a financial controversy, with a crucial report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) directly contradicting President Nayib Bukele’s persistent claims of ongoing cryptocurrency accumulation. This situation has significant implications not just for El Salvador Bitcoin strategy, but for the broader landscape of national crypto adoption . Let’s delve into the details of this intriguing financial standoff. El Salvador Bitcoin: The Bold Experiment and Its Financial Scrutiny El Salvador made global headlines in September 2021 by becoming the first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. This audacious move, spearheaded by President Nayib Bukele, was touted as a way to boost financial inclusion, attract foreign investment, and reduce reliance on traditional financial systems. The nation even launched its own Bitcoin wallet, Chivo, and initiated the purchase of Bitcoin for its national treasury. However, this pioneering spirit has now met with a dose of traditional financial reality, particularly concerning its relationship with the IMF. The latest report from the IMF, a key global financial institution, casts a significant shadow on El Salvador’s recent Bitcoin activities. According to the IMF, El Salvador has not purchased any Bitcoin since signing a substantial $1.4 billion IMF loan deal in December 2024. This directly challenges the narrative put forth by the Salvadoran government, which has frequently asserted that the country continues to accumulate Bitcoin on a daily basis. The report explicitly states that the country’s public Bitcoin holdings remain unchanged, a condition reportedly stipulated by the agreement. Unpacking the IMF Loan Deal: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Holdings? The $1.4 billion loan deal with the IMF is a critical lifeline for El Salvador’s economy, providing much-needed financial stability and support for various development projects. However, such agreements often come with stringent conditions aimed at ensuring fiscal responsibility and mitigating financial risks. In this case, it appears a key condition relates directly to the nation’s volatile digital asset strategy. Why would the IMF impose such a condition on El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings ? The IMF’s primary mandate is to ensure global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. From their perspective, a nation holding significant reserves in a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin introduces considerable risk to its financial stability and ability to repay loans. Limiting or halting further Bitcoin purchases would be a logical step for the IMF to de-risk its exposure and encourage more traditional, stable financial practices. Key aspects of the reported IMF stance include: Risk Mitigation: Reducing exposure to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Fiscal Prudence: Encouraging responsible management of national reserves. Transparency: Ensuring clear reporting on public assets. The contradiction between the IMF’s findings and the government’s claims highlights a significant transparency issue. For a nation that champions financial innovation, the lack of clear, independently verifiable data on its Bitcoin treasury is a point of concern for investors and international bodies alike. President Bukele’s Stance: Navigating the Waters of Crypto Adoption Despite the IMF’s definitive report, President Nayib Bukele has maintained a steadfast public position, insisting that El Salvador continues its policy of accumulating Bitcoin. Cointelegraph, a leading crypto news outlet, has highlighted Bukele’s repeated assertions, which stand in stark contrast to the IMF’s findings. This divergence raises questions about the government’s communication strategy and its relationship with international financial institutions. President Bukele has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, often using social media to announce new purchases or celebrate price milestones. His administration’s narrative has consistently emphasized the long-term benefits of crypto adoption and Bitcoin’s potential to transform the nation’s economy. The current situation, however, puts his claims under intense scrutiny. Is it a matter of political messaging designed to maintain public confidence in the face of external pressure? Or is there a deeper misunderstanding or disagreement about the terms of the loan agreement? This dynamic creates a challenging environment for investors and citizens alike, who rely on clear and consistent information from their government. The discrepancy between official reports and presidential statements underscores the complexities involved when a sovereign nation integrates a novel and ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/el-salvador-bitcoin-imf/,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,Crypto News|BITCOIN|crypto policy|Digital Assets|El Salvador|IMF,BTC,"El Salvador Bitcoin: Unveiling the Crucial IMF Loan Contradiction.

Unpacking the IMF Loan Deal: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Holdings? The $1.4 billion loan deal with the IMF is a critical lifeline for El Salvador’s economy, providing much-needed financial stability and support for various development projects. However, such agreements often come with stringent conditions aimed at ensuring fiscal responsibility and mitigating financial risks. In this case, it appears a key condition relates directly to the nation’s volatile digital asset strategy. Why would the IMF impose such a condition on El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings ? The IMF’s primary mandate is to ensure global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world. From their perspective, a nation holding significant reserves in a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin introduces considerable risk to its financial stability and ability to repay loans. Limiting or halting further Bitcoin purchases would be a logical step for the IMF to de-risk its exposure and encourage more traditional, stable financial practices. Key aspects of the reported IMF stance include: Risk Mitigation: Reducing exposure to Bitcoin’s price volatility. Fiscal Prudence: Encouraging responsible management of national reserves. Transparency: Ensuring clear reporting on public assets. The contradiction between the IMF’s findings and the government’s claims highlights a significant transparency issue. For a nation that champions financial innovation, the lack of clear, independently verifiable data on its Bitcoin treasury is a point of concern for investors and international bodies alike. President Bukele’s Stance: Navigating the Waters of Crypto Adoption Despite the IMF’s definitive report, President Nayib Bukele has maintained a steadfast public position, insisting that El Salvador continues its policy of accumulating Bitcoin. Cointelegraph, a leading crypto news outlet, has highlighted Bukele’s repeated assertions, which stand in stark contrast to the IMF’s findings. This divergence raises questions about the government’s communication strategy and its relationship with international financial institutions. President Bukele has been a vocal proponent of Bitcoin, often using social media to announce new purchases or celebrate price milestones. His administration’s narrative has consistently emphasized the long-term benefits of crypto adoption and Bitcoin’s potential to transform the nation’s economy. The current situation, however, puts his claims under intense scrutiny. Is it a matter of political messaging designed to maintain public confidence in the face of external pressure? Or is there a deeper misunderstanding or disagreement about the terms of the loan agreement? This dynamic creates a challenging environment for investors and citizens alike, who rely on clear and consistent information from their government. The discrepancy between official reports and presidential statements underscores the complexities involved when a sovereign nation integrates a novel and"

Following the massive 96.2 percent rise in 2024, this more moderate increase is considered a signal reflecting cautious optimism from investors. According to the report, the market experienced an 18.61% decline in the first quarter of 2025 but recovered 25.32% in the second quarter, closing the year in positive territory. While global markets experienced volatility during this period due to rising geopolitical tensions and customs duties, this situation presented both risks and opportunities to crypto markets. According to a Binance report, Bitcoin outperformed most traditional stock indices with a 13% increase in value in the first half of 2025. With a market capitalization of over $2 trillion and a 65.1% market dominance, its highest level in four years, BTC remains a favorite asset of institutional investors. Spot Bitcoin ETFs played a significant role in this growth, while more than 140 companies held a total of 848,100 BTC, demonstrating institutional adoption. According to the report, Bitcoin''s fundamental economic model is also undergoing transformation. Despite the slowdown in on-chain activity, Bitcoin''s use in the DeFi (BTCFi) space has increased by over 550% year-over-year. Network security and hash rates remain strong. Layer 1 (L1) blockchains performed differently in the first half of the year. Ethereum maintained its leadership with the Pectra update and strong institutional inflows, while Solana attracted attention with its high transaction volume and increased reliability. BNB Chain broke records in decentralized exchange (DEX) activity and diversified its offerings with memecoins, real-world assets (RWA), and AI-based applications. According to the report, Avalanche grew in enterprise subnets, while Sui chain doubled its DeFi TVL. Tron continued to play a central role in stablecoin transactions, and TON deepened its strategic integration with Telegram. Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) solutions presented a more complex picture. Optimistic rollups maintained their liquidity leadership, while Base and Arbitrum stood out with their sustainable revenue models. ZK rollups, while making technical advancements, lagged behind in terms of TVL and user engagement. Progress in sequencer decentralization and Stage 2 preparations paint a more complex picture. According to Binance, the decentralized finance (DeFi) space transitioned to a more institutional and sustainable structure in the first half of 2025. While total assets locked (TVL) remained stable at approximately $151.5 billion, the number of monthly active users increased by 240 percent year-over-year. DEXs'' share of spot trading volume reached a record 29 percent. Among the notable developments were restaking led by EigenLayer and prediction markets strengthened by the Polymarket-X collaboration. The stablecoin market also continued to grow. Total market capitalization broke a record, surpassing $250 billion. Tether (USDT) maintained its leadership with a market capitalization of $153–156 billion, while Circle''s USDC nearly doubled its supply to $61.5 billion. The US Senate''s passage of the GENIUS Act and the enactment of MiCA regulations in Europe were key factors in boosting institutional confidence.

2025-07-18 19:40:24+00:00,Trump CBDC Stance: A Decisive Blow Against the Digital Dollar,"BitcoinWorld Trump CBDC Stance: A Decisive Blow Against the Digital Dollar In a move that has sent ripples through the financial and cryptocurrency worlds, former U.S. President Donald Trump has once again reaffirmed his staunch opposition to the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States. This declaration, initially highlighted by Walter Bloomberg on X, underscores a consistent position that could significantly shape the future of money and digital assets in America. For anyone invested in the evolving landscape of digital finance, understanding the implications of the Trump CBDC stance is paramount. What is a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) and Why Does it Matter? Before diving into the political ramifications, let’s clarify what a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) actually is. Simply put, it’s a digital form of a country’s fiat currency, issued and backed by its central bank. Think of it as a digital version of the cash in your wallet, but instead of being printed, it exists purely in electronic form. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which are decentralized and often volatile, a CBDC would be centralized, stable, and subject to the direct control of the government. Many nations worldwide are exploring or actively developing CBDCs, aiming to modernize their financial systems, enhance payment efficiency, and potentially foster financial inclusion. However, the concept of a Digital Dollar in the U.S. has sparked intense debate, particularly concerning privacy and government oversight. Here’s a quick breakdown of key CBDC characteristics: Centralized Control: Issued and managed by the central bank. Legal Tender: Would likely be recognized as official currency. Stability: Pegged 1:1 with the national fiat currency. Digital Form: Exists only electronically, no physical counterpart. Former President Donald Trump has consistently voiced concerns regarding a potential U.S. Central Bank Digital Currency. Why the Opposition to a US CBDC? Donald Trump’s Perspective Donald Trump’s reaffirmed commitment to blocking a US CBDC is rooted in specific concerns that resonate with a significant portion of the American populace, particularly those wary of government overreach and the erosion of individual liberties. His primary objections often center on: Privacy Concerns: A CBDC could potentially allow the government to track every transaction made by its citizens. This level of financial surveillance is a major red flag for privacy advocates who fear it could lead to unprecedented control over personal spending and economic activity. Government Control: Opponents argue that a CBDC could give the government the power to directly control individual finances, potentially enabling negative interest rates, expiration dates on money, or even the ability to freeze funds. Trump has framed this as a threat to personal freedom and economic autonomy. Erosion of Financial Freedom: The fear is that a CBDC could pave the way for the elimination of physical cash, forcing all transactions into a digital, traceable system. This would remove the option for anonymous transactions and could limit financial choices. Trump’s rhetoric often positions a Digital Dollar as an instrument of tyranny rather than progress, emphasizing the potential for abuse of power. His stance aligns with a broader sentiment among conservatives and libertarians who prioritize individual freedom and limited government intervention, making the Trump CBDC position a clear policy differentiator. The Broader Implications for US Cryptocurrency Policy The firm opposition to a US CBDC , especially from a prominent political figure like Donald Trump, carries significant weight for the broader Cryptocurrency Policy landscape in the United States. If a CBDC is indeed blocked or significantly delayed, it could have several ripple effects: Boost for Private Cryptocurrencies and Stablecoins: Without a government-backed digital alternative, the demand for decentralized cryptocurrencies and privately issued stablecoins (like USDC or USDT) could see a surge. These assets, which often offer a degree of privacy and decentralization, might become even more attractive to those seeking alternatives to traditional banking and potential government surveillance. Focus on Regulatory Clarity for Existing Assets: Instead of developing a new digital currency, policymakers might be compelled to shift their focus towards establishing clearer regulatory frameworks for the existing crypto market. This could lead to more defined rules for exchanges, stablecoins, NFTs, and other digital assets, fostering a more stable environment for innovation. Preservation of Financial Privacy: The absence of a CBDC, particularly one designed with extensive surveillance capabilities, would mean that current levels of financial privacy for cash transactions and certain crypto transactions would be maintained.

According to the content, a study conducted by Fry (2018) applied a rational bubble model to various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. The model revealed that both Bitcoin and Ethereum exhibited signs of bubble behavior during the observed period, while XRP did not show any characteristics typically associated with a value bubble. This observation is grounded in empirical economic analysis. The excerpt references Ciaian, Rajcaniova, and Kancs (2018), who measured changes in values across Bitcoin and 16 subcoins during 2013 to 2016 using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model. Their findings concluded that macroeconomic and financial developments did not significantly affect XRP’s valuation in the same way they influenced Bitcoin. This implied that speculative pressures had minimal effect on XRP, representing a more stable valuation structure.

These cryptocurrencies demonstrated price patterns that aligned with theoretical expectations for asset bubbles. In contrast, XRP remained outside these dynamics. The study explicitly noted the detection of a bubble in Bitcoin and Ethereum, while none was spotted in XRP . The excerpt underscores the technical and structural reasons for this difference. It states that the absence of bubble-like characteristics in XRP may be due to the superior technological infrastructure underlying Ripple’s system. This includes Ripple’s use of the Unique Node List (UNL) for consensus and transaction validation, which allows for higher consistency, trust, and network efficiency. As explained, at least 40% of nodes must match to initiate block validation, with 80% agreement ultimately required to record a block. These safeguards create conditions less prone to the unregulated speculation often linked to bubble formation. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Technological Superiority as a Core Factor The cited academic analysis concludes that the reason no bubble has been detected in XRP may be directly tied to Ripple’s technological superiority over Bitcoin. This includes Ripple’s consensus mechanism, speed , and governance structure, which contrast sharply with Bitcoin’s energy-intensive proof-of-work model. The excerpt attributes Ripple’s advantage to its resolution of the Byzantine Generals problem through the UNL system, which enhances transaction integrity and ensures broad consensus without needing mining. The system also maintains transparency and anonymity in transaction records, similar to Bitcoin, but achieves efficiency through a different operational logic. These aspects of Ripple’s infrastructure likely contribute to XRP’s resilience against speculative volatility that is more characteristic of Bitcoin and Ethereum. XRP’s Distinct Stability Profile SMQKE summarized these findings in a single statement posted alongside the academic source: “XRP SHOWS NO SIGNS OF A VALUE BUBBLE AS RIPPLE TECHNOLOGY OUTSHINES BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM Documented.” This assertion is substantiated by the referenced academic work, which provides both a model-based and structural explanation for the differing behaviors observed in the cryptocurrency market. The evidence suggests that XRP’s value dynamics are less influenced by speculative behavior and more closely tied to the robust functionality of its underlying technology.

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Crypto Kaleo tells his 709,800 followers on the social media platform X that he envisions the dog-themed digital asset Dogecoin ( DOGE ) surging to a price tag of nearly $7, which would represent a massive gain of over 2,600%. “My target for DOGE this cycle is a one trillion dollar market cap (roughly $6.9420). Memes have proven they have real value throughout the course of the bear market. The king of memes deserves to see $1 trillion.” Dogecoin is trading for $0.24 at time of writing, a 9.97% gain during the last 24 hours. Crypto Kaleo goes on to note he mathematically deduced his prediction by comparing how DOGE did last cycle against Bitcoin ( BTC ) and assuming it would follow a similar pattern. “‘Kaleo, isn’t this a little too bullish?’ Let’s do some math! My target for Bitcoin this cycle is >$500,000. That’s >$10 trillion market cap. Last bull market, Dogecoin hit nearly 10% of BTC’s market cap. 10% of $10 trillion is $1 trillion. $1 trillion market cap for Dogecoin = ~$6.9420 per DOGE.” The analyst concludes by saying that DOGE is currently breaking out versus the top crypto asset by market cap and that traders should expect an upcoming ‘God candle.’ “Dogecoin is breaking out vs. Bitcoin. 100%+ God candle incoming.” Source: Kaleo/X BTC is trading for $118,147 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day.

2025-07-18 19:55:18+00:00,Stablecoin Regulation: Trump’s Historic GENIUS Act Unlocks a New Era for US Crypto,"BitcoinWorld Stablecoin Regulation: Trump’s Historic GENIUS Act Unlocks a New Era for US Crypto The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a monumental development: U.S. President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a comprehensive stablecoin regulation framework in the United States. As reported by Decrypt, this move marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset landscape, promising to reshape how stablecoins operate and are perceived within the traditional financial system. This isn’t just another piece of legislation; it’s a strategic move that could profoundly impact the future of finance, bringing clarity and confidence to a rapidly evolving sector. Understanding the Genesis of the GENIUS Act : A Landmark in Stablecoin Regulation For years, the crypto industry, particularly the stablecoin sector, has operated in a regulatory gray area in the United States. While stablecoins offer immense potential for efficient payments and global remittances, concerns about their stability, reserves, and potential for illicit use have prompted calls for a robust framework. The GENIUS Act (which stands for ‘Guaranteeing an Evolving New Investment in US Stablecoins’ Act, hypothetically) emerges as the answer to these calls, aiming to provide a clear roadmap for issuers and users alike. This legislation didn’t appear overnight. It’s the culmination of extensive debates, proposals, and collaborations between policymakers, industry experts, and financial institutions. The core objectives behind the GENIUS Act are multi-faceted: Ensuring Financial Stability: By mandating stringent reserve requirements and regular audits, the Act seeks to prevent collapses similar to past incidents in the broader crypto market, protecting the integrity of the financial system. Consumer Protection: It introduces measures to safeguard users’ funds, ensuring transparency regarding how stablecoins are backed and providing avenues for recourse in case of issues. Combating Illicit Finance: The framework incorporates robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) provisions, making it harder for stablecoins to be used for illegal activities. Fostering Innovation: By providing regulatory certainty, the Act aims to encourage legitimate innovation within the stablecoin space, attracting more traditional financial players and fostering mainstream adoption. The signing of the GENIUS Act signifies a shift from a reactive approach to a proactive stance on digital asset governance, laying down foundational principles for responsible growth. What Does the GENIUS Act Mean for US Stablecoins ? The implications of the GENIUS Act are profound, especially for US stablecoins . This new law introduces several key provisions that stablecoin issuers will need to adhere to, fundamentally altering their operational models and market positioning. While specific details of the Act would be extensive, here are some hypothetical core components based on common regulatory discussions: Key Provisions of the GENIUS Act: Mandatory Federal Licensing: Stablecoin issuers will likely need to obtain a specific federal license, potentially from a body like the OCC or a newly established regulatory agency, ensuring they meet strict operational and capital requirements. 1:1 Reserve Requirements & Audits: The Act is expected to mandate that all stablecoins are fully backed by highly liquid, high-quality assets (like cash, short-term U.S. Treasuries), held in segregated accounts, and subject to regular, independent third-party audits. These audit reports would likely be made public. Enhanced Consumer Disclosure: Issuers will be required to provide clear, accessible information to consumers about their stablecoin’s backing, redemption policies, and associated risks. Interoperability Standards: The Act might encourage or mandate certain technical standards to promote interoperability among different stablecoins and with traditional financial systems, enhancing efficiency. Supervisory Oversight: Regulators will have the authority to supervise stablecoin issuers, conduct examinations, and enforce compliance with the new rules. This structured approach is designed to instill confidence. For consumers, it means greater security and transparency when using stablecoins. For businesses, it provides a clearer legal framework for integrating stablecoins into their operations, potentially unlocking new payment rails and financial services.

Wilson tells Bloomberg Television in a new interview that Q3 could witness the moderate impact of tariffs. “We’ve been saying, the third quarter is probably the quarter of risk, where you’ll see some of this flow through to the cost of goods sold. I don’t think this is a massive correction. It’s a 5-7% correction. For some companies, it could be bigger, but this is the quarter of risk where the tariffs will start to hit, but the markets are already thinking about this as a temporary impact. And ’26 now, on an earnings growth standpoint, is looking better.” Wilson says he’s hoping the market pulls back for buy opportunities in an otherwise-promising market. “This is what the beginning of a new bull market looks like, right? It’s just explosive. It doesn’t let people in. The rate of change is accelerating beyond what you expected. I think the pullback’s going to be short and shallow, maybe there will be another surprise, another test of some kind, that will cause something more severe.

The company noted that stablecoins offer low-cost and fast solutions, especially in cross-border transactions, and highlighted the future potential of these digital assets. The statement noted that the GENIUS Act, passed by the US Congress, provides the long-awaited legal framework for digital assets and instills confidence in the sector. This step, along with the European Union''s Markets for Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, contributes to a global regulatory momentum. Financial centers such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates are also taking a similar approach by introducing secure and transparent regulations for stablecoins.

2025-07-18 20:10:13+00:00,Strategy is guarding its massive $72 billion BTC stash with an air of secrecy,"Bitcoin giant Strategy is guarding its massive $72 billion BTC stash with an air of secrecy. It has spread its holdings across multiple undisclosed custodians. So far, Coinbase has been confirmed as one of the safekeepers, and speculation points to Fidelity potentially holding some of its BTC. Two weeks ago, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong bragged on X that his company holds Bitcoin for eight of the ten publicly traded BTC holders. This strongly suggests that Coinbase is one of Strategy’s custodians. Our institutional team is crushing it – two awesome stats from our QBR this week: 1) 8 of the top 10 publicly traded companies with BTC on their balance sheet use Coinbase Prime. 2) There''s $140B of crypto in US ETFs, and 81% of that is stored with Coinbase. We’re tracking > 50… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 27, 2025 Strategy has long remained tight-lipped about its arrangements, only referencing “various custody” setups. The Bitcoin giant has carefully avoided naming a single firm responsible for safeguarding its immense digital fortune. Strategy’s most likely custodians What is known about Strategy Bitcoin custodians? They are simply “U.S.-based, institutional-grade custodians that have demonstrated records of regulatory compliance and information security, and all of our custodians are New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”)-regulated custodians.” That’s descriptive enough to whittle down the list of probable custodians. Only 9 of the 35 recipients who had NYDFS BitLicenses had limited purpose trust charters when Strategy sent its letter in the spring of 2023. BitGo, Coinbase, GMO-Z.com, Fidelity, Bakkt, Gemini, NYDIG, Paxos, and Standard Custody & Trust Company are among them. Unsurprisingly, Coinbase is the “principal market for Bitcoin” in MSTR filings. Coinbase was the first place where Strategy bought Bitcoin. Arkham Intelligence says it found $70,000 worth of the company’s BTC going to Fidelity in May. Other than Coinbase and Fidelity, the Bakkt Trust Company could also be on the list. Over the years, Bakkt, the company’s former parent, has been a lot of things. Bakkt bought Digital Asset Custody Company in 2019 and got a limited-purpose trust charter. Will Strategy face FTX’s fate? What Sam Bankman-Fried did with FTX has been a grand cautionary tale for investors. With Strategy’s custody secrecy, the entity could face the same devilish extinction. In another custody scam, the Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank bankruptcy, regulators and shareholders were kept in the dark about how much the company was affected. In that mix, Strategy had used some of its BTC as security for a loan from Silvergate. When asked about their roles in the bankruptcies and how that affected the company, Strategy (then MicroStrategy) told the SEC: Recent bankruptcies in the crypto industry and failures of certain financial institutions have not materially directly impacted the business or financial condition of MicroStrategy. We do not have any material exposure to companies in the crypto industry in our enterprise analytics business, and our customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries. Strategy (then MicroStrategy) The case of FTX could happen to Strategy under Saylor’s leadership – he has faced bankruptcy before. He once lost $6 billion in a day ($11 billion adjusted for inflation) as the dot-com bubble burst. That event was among the biggest single-day personal losses in human history until that point. The rest of the market remains hell bent on getting custody proof, but Micahel Saylor does not think so. He says it is a “bad idea” to publicly share “proof of reserves” or otherwise provide a detailed list of custodians, citing security concerns. However, Armstrong said that Strategy is a public company, trading under the ticker MSTR; therefore, some amount of disclosure is expected. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

So far, Coinbase has been confirmed as one of the safekeepers, and speculation points to Fidelity potentially holding some of its BTC. Two weeks ago, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong bragged on X that his company holds Bitcoin for eight of the ten publicly traded BTC holders. This strongly suggests that Coinbase is one of Strategy’s custodians. Our institutional team is crushing it – two awesome stats from our QBR this week: 1) 8 of the top 10 publicly traded companies with BTC on their balance sheet use Coinbase Prime. 2) There''s $140B of crypto in US ETFs, and 81% of that is stored with Coinbase. We’re tracking > 50… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) June 27, 2025 Strategy has long remained tight-lipped about its arrangements, only referencing “various custody” setups. The Bitcoin giant has carefully avoided naming a single firm responsible for safeguarding its immense digital fortune. Strategy’s most likely custodians What is known about Strategy Bitcoin custodians? They are simply “U.S.-based, institutional-grade custodians that have demonstrated records of regulatory compliance and information security, and all of our custodians are New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”)-regulated custodians.” That’s descriptive enough to whittle down the list of probable custodians. Only 9 of the 35 recipients who had NYDFS BitLicenses had limited purpose trust charters when Strategy sent its letter in the spring of 2023. BitGo, Coinbase, GMO-Z.com, Fidelity, Bakkt, Gemini, NYDIG, Paxos, and Standard Custody & Trust Company are among them. Unsurprisingly, Coinbase is the “principal market for Bitcoin” in MSTR filings. Coinbase was the first place where Strategy bought Bitcoin. Arkham Intelligence says it found $70,000 worth of the company’s BTC going to Fidelity in May. Other than Coinbase and Fidelity, the Bakkt Trust Company could also be on the list. Over the years, Bakkt, the company’s former parent, has been a lot of things. Bakkt bought Digital Asset Custody Company in 2019 and got a limited-purpose trust charter. Will Strategy face FTX’s fate? What Sam Bankman-Fried did with FTX has been a grand cautionary tale for investors. With Strategy’s custody secrecy, the entity could face the same devilish extinction. In another custody scam, the Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank bankruptcy, regulators and shareholders were kept in the dark about how much the company was affected. In that mix, Strategy had used some of its BTC as security for a loan from Silvergate. When asked about their roles in the bankruptcies and how that affected the company, Strategy (then MicroStrategy) told the SEC: Recent bankruptcies in the crypto industry and failures of certain financial institutions have not materially directly impacted the business or financial condition of MicroStrategy. We do not have any material exposure to companies in the crypto industry in our enterprise analytics business, and our customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries. Strategy (then MicroStrategy) The case of FTX could happen to Strategy under Saylor’s leadership – he has faced bankruptcy before. He once lost $6 billion in a day ($11 billion adjusted for inflation) as the dot-com bubble burst. That event was among the biggest single-day personal losses in human history until that point. The rest of the market remains hell bent on getting custody proof, but Micahel Saylor does not think so. He says it is a “bad idea” to publicly share “proof of reserves” or otherwise provide a detailed list of custodians, citing security concerns. However, Armstrong said that Strategy is a public company, trading under the ticker MSTR; therefore, some amount of disclosure is expected. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Crypto founder Arthur Hayes has made a case for ETH leading the way, while Dom Kwok, another crypto founder, believes XRP will pull a surprise. Can XRP Flip Ethereum As Altcoin Season Approaches In an X post , Arthur Hayes indicated that Ethereum will outperform XRP when the altcoin season begins. The BitMEX founder noted that Bitcoin has broken through its all-time high (ATH) on good volume and that ETH is following and will outperform. He further urged market participants to get ready for a “monster” altcoin season. Hayes added that the market is pricing in the likelihood that Donald Trump will again extend the tariffs deadline on August 1 . In another X post , the crypto founder again doubled down on Ethereum, leading the way above other altcoins, such as XRP. He declared that it is ETH season and expects the entire Ethereum ecosystem to thrive as a result. On the other hand, Dom Kwok has doubled down on his prediction that XRP will flip Ethereum. He noted that at the start of the year, he made this prediction and that hw now thinks it is going to happen even sooner than he originally predicted. Earlier in the year, the former Goldman Sachs analyst had highlighted two factors that could make this prediction come true. First, he stated that the RLUSD stablecoin could act as a tailwind by boosting XRP’s demand as the native token of the XRP Ledger, since RLUSD users will need it to transact. It is worth noting that Circle’s USDC has also since launched on the XRP Ledger, another development that could also boost the altcoin’s demand and see it outperform Ethereum. Kwok mentioned the potential XRP ETFs as the second tailwind that could cause XRP to flip Ethereum. He expects these funds to have a positive impact on the altcoin’s price, similar to the effect the Bitcoin ETFs had on the Bitcoin price. These XRP funds are expected to launch this year. Market expert Nate Geraci remarked that Ripple’s decision to drop its cross-appeal in the XRP lawsuit brings these funds one step closer to launch. The Most Simple Bull Case For XRP In another X post , Kwok outlined what he described as the simplest bull case for XRP that no one is talking about. He stated that retail is priced out of Bitcoin and Ethereum , so new retail investors will buy XRP instead of the first two largest cryptos by market cap. He noted that XRP is the third-largest crypto by market cap, yet trades at just around $3.20. The crypto founder believes this combination alone makes it the “most appealing” crypto to any new retail investor.

Fresh reports from Bitcoin World market monitoring indicate that BTC has dipped below the critical $117,000 mark, currently trading at $116,960 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden descent has left many investors wondering about the immediate future and the broader implications for the crypto landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop : What Does it Mean? When Bitcoin, the benchmark cryptocurrency, experiences a sharp decline, it often triggers a ripple effect across the entire digital asset ecosystem. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $117,000 is a notable event, especially given the psychological significance of round numbers and key support levels in market psychology. For many, this price point represents a crucial test of investor conviction and market resilience. A fall below such a level can signal a shift in short-term sentiment from bullish to bearish, potentially inviting further sell-offs. Historically, Bitcoin has been characterized by its extreme price volatility, experiencing numerous significant corrections throughout its journey. These periods of decline, while unsettling for new investors, are not uncommon in the crypto space. They serve as a reminder that digital assets are high-risk, high-reward investments. Understanding the immediate implications involves recognizing that: Liquidation Risks: Traders using high leverage can face forced liquidations, exacerbating selling pressure. Market Sentiment Shift: A drop below key support often fuels fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among retail investors. Opportunity for Accumulation: Long-term investors often view such dips as opportunities to ‘buy the dip’ and accumulate more assets at lower prices. This particular Bitcoin price drop compels us to look deeper into the underlying factors and broader market dynamics that might be at play. Deep Dive into BTC Market Analysis : What’s Driving the Downturn? To truly comprehend the recent price action, a thorough BTC market analysis is essential. Several factors, both internal to the crypto market and external macroeconomic forces, can contribute to such a significant downturn. Pinpointing a single cause is often challenging, as markets are complex systems influenced by a confluence of variables. However, we can explore potential catalysts: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic concerns, such as persistent inflation, rising interest rates by central banks, and geopolitical instability, often lead investors to de-risk. Cryptocurrencies, being risk-on assets, are typically among the first to see outflows during such periods as investors seek safer havens. Regulatory Uncertainty: Ongoing discussions and potential new regulations in major economies can create an environment of caution. Ambiguous or potentially restrictive regulatory frameworks can deter institutional investment and lead to existing holders reducing their exposure. Whale Movements and Institutional Selling: Large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly influence market prices. A substantial sell-off by a few large entities or institutions taking profits after a period of gains can quickly overwhelm buying pressure, leading to rapid price declines. Technical Breakdowns: From a technical analysis perspective, a breach of key support levels (like $117,000 in this case) or the breakdown of established chart patterns (e.g., head and shoulders, rising wedges) can trigger automated sell orders and attract short sellers, accelerating the downtrend. Low Trading Volume and Liquidity: In some instances, a significant price movement can occur on relatively low trading volume, indicating that fewer participants are needed to move the market, making it more susceptible to large swings.

2025-07-18 20:55:18+00:00,Crypto Futures Liquidation: Urgent Warning as $107 Million Vanishes in an Hour,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: Urgent Warning as $107 Million Vanishes in an Hour The cryptocurrency market, a realm known for its exhilarating highs and stomach-churning lows, has once again delivered a stark reminder of its inherent volatility. In a dramatic turn of events that sent ripples across trading desks worldwide, a staggering $107 million worth of crypto futures contracts were liquidated in just the past hour . This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a larger, more ominous trend, with nearly $989 million in futures liquidations recorded over the last 24 hours . For many, this represents a sudden and painful loss, a vivid illustration of the razor-edge risks associated with leveraged trading. But what exactly does this mean, and why are we seeing such a massive crypto futures liquidation event? What Just Happened? Decoding the Crypto Futures Liquidation Event Imagine a high-stakes game where players borrow money to amplify their bets. That’s essentially what happens in futures trading, especially with leverage. When a trader opens a futures position, they’re not buying or selling the actual asset (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) but rather a contract to buy or sell it at a predetermined price in the future. To increase potential profits, many traders use leverage, meaning they put down a small amount of their own capital (margin) and borrow the rest. A liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below a certain threshold, typically due to adverse price movements against their position. Exchanges automatically close these positions to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. The $107 million figure represents the total value of these forced closures in a very short timeframe, indicating a rapid and significant price swing that caught many leveraged traders off guard. The larger 24-hour figure of $989 million paints an even broader picture of the immense financial pressure experienced by the market. Think of it like this: You open a long position: You bet the price will go up. You use 10x leverage: For every $1 you put in, you control $10 worth of crypto. The price drops significantly: Your initial $1 (and the borrowed $9) is quickly eroded. Margin Call/Liquidation: If the price drops enough, your position is automatically closed by the exchange to protect the borrowed funds, and your initial capital is lost. This rapid succession of forced closures can create a domino effect, often referred to as a liquidation cascade , further exacerbating price declines and leading to even more liquidations. Why Does Crypto Market Volatility Lead to Such Events? The very nature of the cryptocurrency market—its crypto market volatility —is a double-edged sword. While it offers unparalleled opportunities for rapid gains, it also presents substantial risks. Unlike traditional markets, crypto markets operate 24/7, are less regulated, and are highly susceptible to sudden shifts in sentiment, news, and whale movements. This inherent unpredictability is a primary driver of large-scale liquidation events. Several factors contribute to this extreme volatility: Low Liquidity (for some assets): While major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum have deep liquidity, many altcoins do not. Lower liquidity means that even relatively small buy or sell orders can cause significant price swings. News and Sentiment: Regulatory announcements, major hacks, celebrity endorsements, or even a single tweet can send prices soaring or plummeting within minutes. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic trends, interest rate changes, or global geopolitical events can also influence investor appetite for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Interconnectedness: The crypto market is highly interconnected. A price drop in Bitcoin can often drag down the entire market, triggering liquidations across various altcoin futures positions. When these factors combine, they can create the perfect storm for rapid price movements that quickly push leveraged positions past their liquidation points, leading to the kind of numbers we’ve just witnessed. Navigating the Perils of Leveraged Trading Leveraged trading, while offering the allure of magnified profits, significantly amplifies risk. It’s a powerful tool, but one that demands extreme caution and a deep understanding of its mechanics. For every dollar of profit you could potentially gain, you risk losing many more, often your entire initial investment, in a flash. Consider the stark difference between spot trading and leveraged futures trading: Feature Spot Trading Leveraged Futures Trading Ownership You own the underlying asset. You own a contract, not the asset. Risk Exposure Limited to your initial investment. Potentially much higher than initial investment (though most exchanges limit losses to margin). Profit/Loss Directly proportional to price movement. Magnified by the leverage ratio. Liquidation Risk None (unless selling under duress).

Surrounded by Republican lawmakers and crypto executives, Trump finalized the bill that brings in new rules for stablecoins, officially locking in Congress’s first real attempt to regulate crypto. According to the fact sheets, the law gives stablecoins a defined legal structure. It also cements crypto’s growing influence in Washington, putting the industry in front of the cameras and into official U.S. policy. Trump didn’t hold back when speaking to the crowd. “This could be perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the internet itself,” he said . “A lot of people are saying that. What do you guys think?

He named Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who wrote the legislation; House Financial Services Chair French Hill of Arkansas; House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota; and Speaker Mike Johnson. Industry names were also recognized: Brian Armstrong of Coinbase, Jeremy Allaire of Circle, and Paolo Ardoino of Tether. “This signing is a massive validation of your hard work and your pioneering spirit and your ability to never give up,” Trump said to the crypto execs in the room. Trump used the 2024 election to push pro-crypto policies in contrast to the Biden administration’s tougher stance. “It’s good for the dollar and it’s good for the country,” he said. “And that’s why I backed you at an early stage. And I also did it for the votes, because you did come out and vote, I will say.” But Trump’s connection to crypto isn’t just about policy. Bloomberg found that he’s made around $620 million from crypto projects during his second term.

2025-07-18 21:05:36+00:00,The Node: The Mad Journey from Terra to GENIUS,"Remember Terra? Do Kwon’s layer 1 was designed in such a way that its native token, LUNA, worked in tandem with the network’s algorithmic stablecoin, UST. When you minted new UST, you destroyed LUNA tokens (thereby constricting supply), and when you redeemed UST, you created new LUNA (expanding supply). That system worked wonderfully as long as UST experienced great demand — which it did, for a while, thanks to a 20% yearly interest on the coin supplied by Anchor Protocol. But in May 2022, huge selloffs caused UST to lose its $1 peg; market participants rushed to redeem their UST, creating a massive new amount of LUNA and pushing the token’s price down, which of course led to more UST redemptions, and so on. Over $40 billion in market value was obliterated in 72 hours. Terra’s collapse shook the crypto industry, which back then was levered to the gills. Crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital blew up , while crypto lenders such as Voyager , BlockFi and Celsius went bust. If that wasn’t enough, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Ethereum’s Tornado Cash, sending developers all over the world in a bit of a panic. After CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported in November 2022 that Alameda was quite possibly broke, people started yanking their funds out of FTX, which led Bankman-Fried to freeze withdrawals. It turned out that SBF had been fraudulently using FTX customer funds to palliate losses incurred by Alameda Research over the course of the years. Bankman-Fried was arrested (and subsequently sentenced to 25 years in prison) shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy. Shortly after FTX’s demise, SEC Chair Gary Gensler began an aggressive campaign against the sector, suing a huge number of crypto firms (including Coinbase and Kraken ) and ushering in an era of “regulation by enforcement” that was decried by the industry and friendly members of Congress alike. That wasn’t the end of crypto’s tribulations. Crypto lender Genesis and bitcoin miner Core Scientific were soon added to the list of casualties. Worse, in March 2023 three crypto-friendly banks (Signature, Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank) suffered from bank-runs and collapsed , making it significantly more difficult for crypto firms to access the banking system. Nic Carter, a prominent crypto VC, accused the Biden administration of trying to debank the crypto industry by employing an Obama-era strategy, a theory which has since gained traction within Congress and the Trump administration. But the winds of fortune finally turned in crypto’s favor. When BlackRock filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in June 2023, it felt like Larry Fink himself was shooting a flare in the dark, signaling that Wall Street was ready to embrace crypto. Two months later, Grayscale defeated the SEC in court on the matter of converting its bitcoin trust into an ETF. The agency had little choice than to greenlight a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, which later became the most successful new ETFs of all time. At first showing signs of reluctance about launching spot ether ETFs, the SEC suddenly scrambled to approve the products at the last minute. Some observers linked the change of heart to Trump’s new friendliness towards the crypto industry, which contrasted with Joe Biden’s hostility . The fact that the crypto industry donated a tremendous amount of money to the former’s campaign (and to other pro-crypto politicians) certainly helped as well; we saw yesterday that the Democratic Party, once in lockstep with Elizabeth Warren’s anti-crypto crusade , strongly voted in favor of both the GENIUS and Clarity bills.

2025-07-18 21:10:09+00:00,Russia considers allowing cryptocurrency payments on two islands,"Russia should allow companies registered on two islands at both ends of the vast country to conduct settlements in cryptocurrencies, a Russian senator has suggested. The destinations are designated as special administrative regions, and the digital transactions there won’t clash with the central bank’s stance that crypto payments must be kept outside the nation’s main jurisdiction. Russia to trial crypto payments in the heart of Europe and the Far East Russian firms based in the special administrative regions (SARs) established on Russky Island, in the Far-Eastern Primorsky Krai, and Oktyabrsky Island, in the Pregolya River in Russia’s European exclave of Kaliningrad, may start testing cryptocurrency settlements. The idea was pitched by Alexander Shenderyuk-Zhidkov, deputy chairman of the Committee on Budget and Financial Markets at the Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, informally called the Senate. Quoted by the business daily Vedomosti, the lawmaker explained that such entities are not considered residents of the Russian Federation as far as currency regulations are concerned. This would allow them to carry out crypto transactions outside the space reserved for the Russian ruble, the only legal tender in the country, as required by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ). While cryptocurrencies are yet to be comprehensively regulated, they have been recognized as property for various purposes, but using them for payments in the Russian Federation is prohibited. So far, Russia’s monetary authority has only agreed to permit their use in cross-border settlements for foreign trade, exclusively within an “experimental legal regime” (ELR) under its strict supervision. The mechanism is allegedly used by Russian businesses to bypass financial restrictions imposed by Western sanctions, but the CBR has not disclosed either the full terms or the organizations involved. According to Zhidkov, the implementation of the ELR is “too slow.” He was quoted as stating: “I would not like it if we spent six years getting the law right … After all, the ELR is experimental, so that we can experiment, and then accept this and spread it.” The senator is convinced it’s possible to extend the ELR rules to the SARs on the two islands and give some leeway in their interpretation. Shenderyuk-Zhidkov believes this can also help attract what he called “foreign companies with Russian roots,” thus bringing some of the crypto assets with Russian origins back to the country as a measure countering capital flight. As of the end of 2024, there were nearly 500 companies registered in Russia’s special administrative regions that offer flexible tax and currency regulations, among which the Russian tech giant Yandex, for example. Experts say it’s a sound idea that still needs Bank of Russia’s nod Allowing companies registered on the two islands to use cryptocurrencies for settlements is fairly realistic, according to Mikhail Uspensky, member of the expert council of the working group on legislative regulation of cryptocurrency circulation at the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. This would increase the number of players authorized to make crypto payments, which will have a positive effect on the development of the whole market in Russia, predicted Uspensky. However, he expects the initiative to face a long series of approval procedures before getting the green light. Maria Agranovskaya, Managing Partner of the Agranovskaya & Partners law firm, largely agreed in her comments: “The idea itself is sound, but we need to think deeply about how to do it correctly without breaking the law … The opinion of the Bank of Russia is important.” Zhidkov’s proposal is not the first of its kind. Back in 2018, the Ministry of Finance suggested using the SARs to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. “We are considering organized trading on Russky Island and Oktyabrsky Island, but we believe this should be allowed in [the rest of] Russia,” its deputy head, Alexey Moiseev, said at the time. Since then, the department seems to have rather sided with the CBR’s position on crypto operations in the country.

Quoted by the business daily Vedomosti, the lawmaker explained that such entities are not considered residents of the Russian Federation as far as currency regulations are concerned. This would allow them to carry out crypto transactions outside the space reserved for the Russian ruble, the only legal tender in the country, as required by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ). While cryptocurrencies are yet to be comprehensively regulated, they have been recognized as property for various purposes, but using them for payments in the Russian Federation is prohibited. So far, Russia’s monetary authority has only agreed to permit their use in cross-border settlements for foreign trade, exclusively within an “experimental legal regime” (ELR) under its strict supervision. The mechanism is allegedly used by Russian businesses to bypass financial restrictions imposed by Western sanctions, but the CBR has not disclosed either the full terms or the organizations involved. According to Zhidkov, the implementation of the ELR is “too slow.” He was quoted as stating: “I would not like it if we spent six years getting the law right … After all, the ELR is experimental, so that we can experiment, and then accept this and spread it.” The senator is convinced it’s possible to extend the ELR rules to the SARs on the two islands and give some leeway in their interpretation. Shenderyuk-Zhidkov believes this can also help attract what he called “foreign companies with Russian roots,” thus bringing some of the crypto assets with Russian origins back to the country as a measure countering capital flight. As of the end of 2024, there were nearly 500 companies registered in Russia’s special administrative regions that offer flexible tax and currency regulations, among which the Russian tech giant Yandex, for example. Experts say it’s a sound idea that still needs Bank of Russia’s nod Allowing companies registered on the two islands to use cryptocurrencies for settlements is fairly realistic, according to Mikhail Uspensky, member of the expert council of the working group on legislative regulation of cryptocurrency circulation at the State Duma, the lower house of parliament. This would increase the number of players authorized to make crypto payments, which will have a positive effect on the development of the whole market in Russia, predicted Uspensky. However, he expects the initiative to face a long series of approval procedures before getting the green light. Maria Agranovskaya, Managing Partner of the Agranovskaya & Partners law firm, largely agreed in her comments: “The idea itself is sound, but we need to think deeply about how to do it correctly without breaking the law … The opinion of the Bank of Russia is important.” Zhidkov’s proposal is not the first of its kind. Back in 2018, the Ministry of Finance suggested using the SARs to trade cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. “We are considering organized trading on Russky Island and Oktyabrsky Island, but we believe this should be allowed in [the rest of] Russia,” its deputy head, Alexey Moiseev, said at the time. Since then, the department seems to have rather sided with the CBR’s position on crypto operations in the country.

Instead of sitting idle in cold wallets or static ETF holdings, BTC can now move freely across applications that were previously out of reach. Trading with near-zero fees, deploying DeFi protocols with native BTC liquidity, or launching NFT drops that are settled on Bitcoin. And while all of that runs on Layer-2, the Bitcoin itself stays locked on the base chain secured by Bitcoin’s own consensus. The bridge uses zero-knowledge proofs for verification, so users can move BTC in and out without middlemen, while keeping full trust in the original network.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a breakout coin, exploding in both investor interest and trading volume amid the broader rally. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 80% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.6 million has been raised to date, and over 13600 investors have entered the presale.

2025-07-18 22:00:12+00:00,"Tom Lee Predicts $30,000 Per Ethereum As Treasury Frenzy Begins","Tom Lee devoted a six-post thread on X yesterday to a single proposition: if companies treat Ethereum (ETH) the way MicroStrategy treats bitcoin, the token price need only follow the mathematics of balance-sheet absorption to reach roughly $30,000. Lee’s argument rests on the mechanics he says really powered MicroStrategy’s spectacular equity rerating. From 11 August 2020 through today the software company’s shares climbed from $13 to about $455, a 35-fold gain. Only eleven of those thirty-five turns came from bitcoin’s own rise—roughly $11,000 to $118,000 in the same period—while twenty-five turns were created by “treasury strategy,” Lee wrote, meaning repeated financings that increased BTC per share even faster than the coin’s spot price. Ethereum To $30,000? Lee lists three moves that made the template work and, in his view, will be even more potent for ETH: issuing new stock above net-asset value to acquire more tokens, exploiting token volatility to lower borrowing costs, and relying on convertibles or preferred shares to cap dilution. Because ether’s realised volatility still exceeds bitcoin’s, Lee argues the cost of debt-and-option structures used to lever the treasury can be driven lower still, accelerating token accumulation. Related Reading: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May’s Playbook Predicts Another Breakout In the same thread he reposted a chart showing that his own vehicle, BitMine Immersion Technologies, purchased four times more notional value in its first week of activity ($1 billion in ETH) than MicroStrategy bought in its first week of bitcoin purchases back in 2020. BitMine’s numbers illustrate the scale. A regulatory filing and follow-up press release on 17 July confirmed the company now holds 300,657 ETH—just over $1 billion at the time of publication—after closing a $250 million private placement on 8 July. Lee, who chairs BitMine’s board, said the firm is “well on our way to acquiring and staking five per cent of the overall ETH supply.” The second-largest treasurer is SharpLink Gaming, chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. On 17 July the company updated its SEC prospectus to increase the stock it can sell from $1 billion to $6 billion, saying proceeds will fund additional ETH purchases. SharpLink had already raised $413 million between 7 and 11 July and disclosed 280,706 ETH on its books as of 13 July, all but a few hundred of which are staked for yield. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst Bit Digital rounds out the trio. After a $172 million underwritten share sale on 7 July and the liquidation of 280 bitcoin, the Nasdaq-listed miner reported a treasury of 100,603 ETH and declared its intention to become “the pre-eminent ETH holding company in the world,” according to chief executive Sam Tabar. Taken together, the three firms now control roughly 682,000 ETH, or about half a per cent of the circulating supply, and each has active authorisations to issue more equity or debt expressly for ether accumulation. Lee insists the reflexive loop this creates—higher share prices providing ever-cheaper capital that buys still more token per share—can compress the time it takes for price to capture scarcity. Crypto analyst DCInvestor, responding to Lee’s thread, distilled the mathematics into a range: “Tom Lee basically calling for like $30-80K ETH. And some of you think we are gonna stop $1-2K after last cycle’s all-time high.” Ether changes hands today near $3,600. An eight-fold move to $30,000 would merely replicate the multiple that bitcoin logged between MicroStrategy’s first treasury purchase and its 2021 peak. The difference, Lee argues, is that MicroStrategy spent four years proving the model; Ethereum treasuries have taken less than two months to raise their first few billion dollars.

Tom Lee devoted a six-post thread on X yesterday to a single proposition: if companies treat Ethereum (ETH) the way MicroStrategy treats bitcoin, the token price need only follow the mathematics of balance-sheet absorption to reach roughly $30,000. Lee’s argument rests on the mechanics he says really powered MicroStrategy’s spectacular equity rerating. From 11 August 2020 through today the software company’s shares climbed from $13 to about $455, a 35-fold gain. Only eleven of those thirty-five turns came from bitcoin’s own rise—roughly $11,000 to $118,000 in the same period—while twenty-five turns were created by “treasury strategy,” Lee wrote, meaning repeated financings that increased BTC per share even faster than the coin’s spot price. Ethereum To $30,000? Lee lists three moves that made the template work and, in his view, will be even more potent for ETH: issuing new stock above net-asset value to acquire more tokens, exploiting token volatility to lower borrowing costs, and relying on convertibles or preferred shares to cap dilution. Because ether’s realised volatility still exceeds bitcoin’s, Lee argues the cost of debt-and-option structures used to lever the treasury can be driven lower still, accelerating token accumulation. Related Reading: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May’s Playbook Predicts Another Breakout In the same thread he reposted a chart showing that his own vehicle, BitMine Immersion Technologies, purchased four times more notional value in its first week of activity ($1 billion in ETH) than MicroStrategy bought in its first week of bitcoin purchases back in 2020. BitMine’s numbers illustrate the scale. A regulatory filing and follow-up press release on 17 July confirmed the company now holds 300,657 ETH—just over $1 billion at the time of publication—after closing a $250 million private placement on 8 July. Lee, who chairs BitMine’s board, said the firm is “well on our way to acquiring and staking five per cent of the overall ETH supply.” The second-largest treasurer is SharpLink Gaming, chaired by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin. On 17 July the company updated its SEC prospectus to increase the stock it can sell from $1 billion to $6 billion, saying proceeds will fund additional ETH purchases. SharpLink had already raised $413 million between 7 and 11 July and disclosed 280,706 ETH on its books as of 13 July, all but a few hundred of which are staked for yield. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst Bit Digital rounds out the trio. After a $172 million underwritten share sale on 7 July and the liquidation of 280 bitcoin, the Nasdaq-listed miner reported a treasury of 100,603 ETH and declared its intention to become “the pre-eminent ETH holding company in the world,” according to chief executive Sam Tabar. Taken together, the three firms now control roughly 682,000 ETH, or about half a per cent of the circulating supply, and each has active authorisations to issue more equity or debt expressly for ether accumulation. Lee insists the reflexive loop this creates—higher share prices providing ever-cheaper capital that buys still more token per share—can compress the time it takes for price to capture scarcity.

2025-07-18 22:00:24+00:00,Bitcoin Realised Cap Hits $1T All‑Time High: Strong Capital Base For Growth,"Bitcoin is currently consolidating just below the psychological $120,000 level, cooling off after last week’s surge to a new all-time high. While bulls maintain control, price action has slowed, giving room for Ethereum to take the spotlight with a sharp breakout above $3,600. Amid this evolving environment, fresh on-chain data from CryptoQuant highlights a historic moment for Bitcoin. The network’s Realised Cap — a metric that values each coin at the price it last moved — hit a new all-time high. This milestone underscores the growing strength and maturity of Bitcoin’s capital base, especially as institutional interest and long-term holding trends continue to rise. To add a bullish note, this period of consolidation follows a major regulatory development: the US House of Representatives has officially passed three key crypto bills, including the GENIUS and Clarity Acts, ushering in long-awaited legal clarity for digital assets. A Signal of Bitcoin’s Growing Maturity Top analyst Axel Adler has highlighted a significant milestone for Bitcoin: the network’s Realised Cap has officially surpassed $1 trillion for the first time in its history, marking a new all-time high. Unlike traditional market capitalization — which multiplies the current price by total supply — Realised Cap calculates the value of each coin based on the price at which it was last moved. This methodology offers a clearer and more grounded view of the capital that is actually invested and held within the Bitcoin network. Adler explains that this metric filters out speculative extremes and emphasizes coins that are truly being held by market participants, making it a more reliable indicator of Bitcoin’s underlying strength. To illustrate the significance of this milestone, he notes: “If a company earned $1 every second, it would take 31,710 years to accumulate one trillion dollars.” This comparison puts into perspective the immense scale of value now stored within the Bitcoin ecosystem. As Bitcoin consolidates below $120,000 following its recent all-time high, the rise in Realised Cap reinforces the idea that this cycle is built on a stronger foundation than in previous rallies. With increasing institutional adoption, regulatory clarity emerging in the US, and growing long-term holder conviction, many analysts believe that Bitcoin is on the verge of another expansive growth phase in the coming months. BTC Price Consolidates After Breakout Bitcoin (BTC) is currently consolidating below the psychological $120,000 level after a strong multi-week rally. The 12-hour chart shows BTC trading between a clear range, with resistance at $123,230 and support at $115,730. This horizontal structure signals a healthy pause after a significant move, allowing the market to digest gains and potentially prepare for the next leg higher. Despite minor pullbacks within the range, price action remains above all key moving averages: the 50 SMA ($111,306), the 100 SMA ($108,314), and the 200 SMA ($102,603), all trending upward. This alignment suggests bullish momentum remains intact, with the 50 SMA acting as dynamic support during shallow corrections. Volume remains elevated compared to earlier in July, indicating continued participation and strong interest from buyers. As long as BTC maintains its structure above the $115K–$116K region, bulls are likely to remain in control. A confirmed breakout above $123,230 could open the door to new all-time highs, while a breakdown below $115,730 might trigger short-term downside toward $111K.

2025-07-18 22:30:00+00:00,"China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts the Price of XRP, Dogecoin and Hyperliquid by the End of July 2025","China’s leading AI platform DeepSeek predicts that prominent altcoins will achieve unprecedented price milestones in the latter half of 2025, driven by Bitcoin’s exceptional rally. Earlier this week, Bitcoin set a new historical benchmark, reaching an all-time high of $122,838. Market analysts believe this bullish momentum could persist, further accelerating cryptocurrency adoption on a global scale. Bitcoin’s impressive ascent has sparked renewed enthusiasm among investors, with speculation mounting that the ongoing rally could eclipse the legendary bull run of 2021, propelling top altcoins to fresh valuation peaks. Outlined below are the digital currencies that China’s cutting-edge DeepSeek AI predicts to deliver strong gains in the coming months. XRP (Ripple): China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts Massive Upside for the Cross-Border Payments Giant DeepSeek’s latest forecasts suggest Ripple’s XRP could soar to $5 by the end of 2025—a remarkable leap from its current value around $3.45, however this is likely too conservative, given that XRP set a new ATH earlier today of $3.65, its first high watermark since it hit $3.40 back in 2018. DeepSeek’s projection is also a quarter of that of its biggest rival, ChatGPT, which suggests heights of $20. XRP has solidified its reputation as a fast, affordable, and regulator-friendly cross-border transaction solution. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) acknowledged XRP’s capability to facilitate rapid global payments without traditional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark court ruling in 2023 declared that retail sales of XRP were not securities transactions, effectively undermining the SEC’s long-standing stance against Ripple and bolstering confidence across the altcoin market. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse officially announced the SEC dropped the four-year case, removing regulatory uncertainty for XRP and setting a precedent for all other altcoins. However, achieving the ambitious $20 target will require a major catalyst, such as regulatory reform in the U.S., where the crypto industry continues to advocate for comprehensive legal frameworks. XRP has been on a strong upward trajectory, climbing 7% over the past 24 hours and 55% in the last fortnight, driven largely by substantial whale accumulation. These large-scale purchases have pushed its relative strength index (RSI) to a heated 89, suggesting potential profit-taking ahead that will depreciate its price. However, the previous $3 resistance level is likely to switch to a strong psychological support level, priming XRP to run up to $5 by mid-fall and possibly even $20 by year end. . Over the past year, XRP has delivered an impressive 499% gain, far exceeding Bitcoin’s 83% rise, and remains the best-performing multibillion-cap crypto asset this year. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Founding Meme Coin Set for Major Breakout Dogecoin ($DOGE) , originally launched as a lighthearted parody in 2013, now commands a robust market capitalisation of over $36.6 billion, driven by a devoted community and increasing utility. Typically mirroring Bitcoin’s price trends, DOGE blends meme-fuelled volatility with long-term resilience. Trading currently at $0.2438, Dogecoin has risen by 14% in the past 24 hours and 19% over the past week. With an RSI of 81 it’s likely to follow XRP into a slight dip which will ultimately help to consolidate its gains while providing profits for its supporters. Chart analysis reveals a distinct falling wedge pattern from November through April, suggesting a likely breakout in the near term. DeepSeek AI predicts DOGE reaching as high as $1 during an extended bull phase, which would equate to a potential 4X gain from its current valuation. In terms of adoption, Dogecoin continues to attract high-profile support. Tesla accepts DOGE payments for select merchandise, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE for transactions, enhancing its practical use case. China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts The $HYPE Token Powering the Eponymous Crypto Millionaire-Maker DEX Will Go Higher Yet Since launching late last year, Hyperliquid and its native $HYPE token have emerged as standout players in the decentralised exchange (DEX) arena. It currently trades at $45 but DeepSeek expects it to hit $100 by the New Year. Operating on its own proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Hyperliquid ensures full user custody over funds—an increasingly critical factor following the collapse of major centralised exchanges like FTX. Offering competitive fees, lightning-fast trade execution, and advanced features like perpetual derivatives, Hyperliquid combines the best of decentralised and centralised exchange platforms.

XRP has solidified its reputation as a fast, affordable, and regulator-friendly cross-border transaction solution. In 2024, the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) acknowledged XRP’s capability to facilitate rapid global payments without traditional intermediaries. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!! UN Endorses @Ripple and @StellarOrg as Cornerstones of New Global Payments Network! #XRP and #XLM will run the new financial system! pic.twitter.com/ufewexCKmR — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) October 13, 2024 A landmark court ruling in 2023 declared that retail sales of XRP were not securities transactions, effectively undermining the SEC’s long-standing stance against Ripple and bolstering confidence across the altcoin market. In March, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse officially announced the SEC dropped the four-year case, removing regulatory uncertainty for XRP and setting a precedent for all other altcoins. However, achieving the ambitious $20 target will require a major catalyst, such as regulatory reform in the U.S., where the crypto industry continues to advocate for comprehensive legal frameworks. XRP has been on a strong upward trajectory, climbing 7% over the past 24 hours and 55% in the last fortnight, driven largely by substantial whale accumulation. These large-scale purchases have pushed its relative strength index (RSI) to a heated 89, suggesting potential profit-taking ahead that will depreciate its price. However, the previous $3 resistance level is likely to switch to a strong psychological support level, priming XRP to run up to $5 by mid-fall and possibly even $20 by year end. . Over the past year, XRP has delivered an impressive 499% gain, far exceeding Bitcoin’s 83% rise, and remains the best-performing multibillion-cap crypto asset this year. Dogecoin ($DOGE): Founding Meme Coin Set for Major Breakout Dogecoin ($DOGE) , originally launched as a lighthearted parody in 2013, now commands a robust market capitalisation of over $36.6 billion, driven by a devoted community and increasing utility. Typically mirroring Bitcoin’s price trends, DOGE blends meme-fuelled volatility with long-term resilience. Trading currently at $0.2438, Dogecoin has risen by 14% in the past 24 hours and 19% over the past week. With an RSI of 81 it’s likely to follow XRP into a slight dip which will ultimately help to consolidate its gains while providing profits for its supporters. Chart analysis reveals a distinct falling wedge pattern from November through April, suggesting a likely breakout in the near term. DeepSeek AI predicts DOGE reaching as high as $1 during an extended bull phase, which would equate to a potential 4X gain from its current valuation. In terms of adoption, Dogecoin continues to attract high-profile support. Tesla accepts DOGE payments for select merchandise, while platforms like PayPal and Revolut have integrated DOGE for transactions, enhancing its practical use case. China’s DeepSeek AI Predicts The $HYPE Token Powering the Eponymous Crypto Millionaire-Maker DEX Will Go Higher Yet Since launching late last year, Hyperliquid and its native $HYPE token have emerged as standout players in the decentralised exchange (DEX) arena. It currently trades at $45 but DeepSeek expects it to hit $100 by the New Year. Operating on its own proprietary Layer 1 blockchain, Hyperliquid ensures full user custody over funds—an increasingly critical factor following the collapse of major centralised exchanges like FTX. Offering competitive fees, lightning-fast trade execution, and advanced features like perpetual derivatives, Hyperliquid combines the best of decentralised and centralised exchange platforms. Technical analysis, since its debut, shows robust bullish trends. Two bulli"

2025-07-18 23:24:13+00:00,Peter Thiel-backed crypto exchange Bullish files for NYSE debut,"Bullish, the crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel, filed to go public on Friday, according to documents reviewed from the company’s IPO registration. The platform, which was launched as a spinout of Block.one, wants to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BLSH, marking another step in crypto’s growing push into traditional equity markets. The filing was submitted by Tom Farley, the firm’s CEO and former president of the NYSE. Tom now leads Bullish as it aims to scale beyond the private markets it’s been operating in. The IPO filing also revealed raw numbers. As of March 31, Bullish has processed over $1.25 trillion in total trading volume since launching. In the first quarter of 2025 alone, it reported $2.5 billion in average daily volume, which places it in the top five exchanges globally for spot Bitcoin and Ether trades. That’s based on internal data provided directly by the company. Bullish builds on big names, big volumes, and big politics The exchange started with cash from Founders Fund, Thiel Capital, Nomura, Mike Novogratz, and others. In 2023, Bullish bought crypto news outlet CoinDesk, adding media muscle to its platform. It now competes directly with Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken, as noted in the public prospectus. Tom didn’t comment directly in the filing, but the document did include a line from Bullish’s leadership that read: “In the first quarter of 2025, Bullish exchange executed over $2.5 billion in average daily volume, ranking in the top five exchanges by spot volume for Bitcoin and Ether.” This year has already seen multiple crypto companies try to grab a piece of the public market. Circle, the stablecoin issuer, went public in June and its valuation has climbed more than sevenfold since. In May, Etoro also debuted with a platform that allows users to trade crypto assets. Novogratz’s own company, Galaxy Digital, migrated its listing from Toronto to the Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Gemini, the exchange created by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, quietly filed for its own U.S. IPO last month. Bitcoin hasn’t been sitting still either. It’s currently trading above $117,000, a major jump from the $94,000 range it was hovering around at the start of 2025. Capital is still pouring into the sector, and that momentum is giving firms like Bullish more leverage when approaching public markets. On the regulatory side, President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on the same day as Bullish’s IPO filing. The act introduces new stablecoin regulations to protect consumers. These digital tokens are supposed to be pegged to things like the U.S. dollar and are marketed as less volatile alternatives to regular crypto. Bullish’s SEC filing made its intentions clear: the company said it aims to “drive the adoption of stablecoins, crypto, and blockchain technology.” That wording wasn’t a throwaway. It’s directly tied to the bigger political forces backing this entire move. Thiel, Elon Musk, and David Sacks, who currently leads Trump’s AI and crypto strategy team, have all dumped massive funding into Trump’s reelection campaign.

2025-07-18 23:26:03+00:00,ChatGPT’s 42-Signal Bitcoin Analysis Flags Critical $121K Test After Historic $123K ATH Pullback,"ChatGPT’s AI model processed 42 live indicators, revealing consolidation momentum as Bitcoin holds $117,600 following a historic $123,091 all-time high (ATH) achieved on July 14th , with a -1.32% daily decline testing whether the rally marks the beginning of a bull market or peak exhaustion. Trading above all EMAs while RSI at healthy 64.37 suggests a technical reset amid institutional positioning uncertainty. A strong structural foundation emerges, with the price 16.9% above the 200-day EMA ( $97,723 ), while the MACD maintains bullish momentum despite a pullback from historic highs. The market cap stands at $2.34 trillion, with a daily volume of $82.25 billion, as Charles Schwab launches Bitcoin trading and Trump’s “Genius Act” opens a $9 trillion retirement market to crypto investments. The following analysis synthesizes ChatGPT’s 42 real-time technical indicators, retirement market developments, institutional adoption acceleration, and historic high implications to assess BTC’s 90-day trajectory amid a critical inflection point that determines whether the continuation or correction will occur. Technical Crossroads: Historic High Pullback Tests Bull Market Validity Bitcoin’s current price of $117,600 reflects a minor 1.32% daily decline from its historic all-time high of $123,091 , achieved on July 14th , marking a critical consolidation phase. The $3,505 intraday range represents 3.0% of the current price, demonstrating controlled volatility during institutional position adjustment periods. Source: TradingView RSI at 64.37 , a healthy level , provides optimal positioning with room for continued appreciation without overbought concerns, suggesting a technical reset rather than a trend reversal. This positioning suggests a sustainable bull market structure rather than an exhaustion spike, although decisive action above the $121K resistance remains crucial for validation. MACD indicators display strong bullish momentum, with a positive histogram at 2,836.92, confirming underlying strength despite a short-term pullback. Source: TradingView The combination of healthy RSI positioning and strong MACD signals creates an optimal setup for continuation toward $125K-$127K targets once consolidation completes. Retirement Market Revolution: Trump’s “Genius Act” Opens $9 Trillion Gateway President Trump’s planned signing of the “Genius Act” represents a revolutionary catalyst opening the $9 trillion US retirement market to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investments. This development could trigger unprecedented institutional demand as 401(k) and pension funds gain regulatory approval for digital asset allocation. The retirement market integration addresses previous regulatory barriers that prevented institutional participation, creating sustainable demand drivers beyond speculative trading. Professional retirement fund managers, who are subject to fiduciary compliance, now have a regulatory framework for allocating Bitcoin to their treasuries. Charles Schwab’s launch of Bitcoin and Ethereum trading services validates the mainstream financial services’ embrace of cryptocurrency infrastructure. The $10 trillion asset manager’s entry provides credibility, attracting conservative institutional capital that was previously excluded from direct cryptocurrency exposure. Market Dominance Dynamics: Altcoin Season Speculation Builds Bitcoin’s market dominance, at 60.86% , shows a slight decline as altcoin season speculation intensifies following BTC’s historic high. This dominance shift creates a binary scenario in which Bitcoin either maintains its leadership or capital shifts toward altcoin alternatives. BTC dominance dropping “hard” according to analysts suggests a major utility season ahead as institutional capital explores high-performance blockchain alternatives. This rotation pattern has historically preceded significant altcoin appreciation cycles, while Bitcoin consolidates its gains. Historical Context: ATH Achievement Creates Psychological Inflection Bitcoin’s July 14th all-time high of $123,091 represents the culmination of institutional adoption momentum that had been building throughout 2021 . Current 4.36% discount to ATH provides attractive positioning while maintaining the psychological significance of historic breakthrough achievement. The 15% appreciation from June’s $108,799 close demonstrates sustained institutional demand despite broader market uncertainty. Historic high achievement creates a psychological inflection point where Bitcoin either validates a new valuation paradigm through continued appreciation or experiences a correction as early adopters secure profits. The next 30-60 days remain critical for determining the long-term trajectory. Support & Resistance: EMA Strength Provides Foundation Immediate support emerges at today’s low around $117,316 , reinforced by psychological support at $115,000-$116,000 .

This change would unlock access to crypto exposure within the $9 trillion retirement market , where even a modest allocation to crypto could translate into tens of billions in new capital flowing into digital assets. Trump’s Crypto Pivot: Retirement Reform Or Risky Bet? In an X post , NewsGate revealed an update concerning the new report in the Financial Times. The expert noted that President Donald Trump is preparing to open the $9 trillion US retirement market to cryptocurrency investments, which marks a significant shift from traditional retirement investment norms. This direction aligns with recent developments, including Trump’s executive order signed on January 23, 2025, which explicitly supports the growth of the U.S crypto industry. The order called for regulatory clarity, innovation incentives, and infrastructure investment, which signals a renewed federal commitment to positioning America as a global crypto leader. Reinforcing this direction, a Washington Post investigation revealed that 1 in 5 of Trump’s top appointees hold personal crypto assets , with a collective value of up to $120 million. These disclosures suggest direct financial alignment within the administration. While interest in adding crypto to retirement accounts is growing, historical data from Investopedia highlights impending volatility. This is akin to Bitcoin’s surge to its previous high of $109,026.02 in January 2025 after Trump’s order, only to experience a sharp and sudden fluctuation in the weeks that followed. Furthermore, this pattern of rapid appreciation has raised concerns about the suitability of cryptocurrencies in retirement portfolios. However, while digital assets like Bitcoin are often praised for their potential diversification benefits and inflation protection, their unpredictability may conflict with the core principles of long-term and stable retirement planning.

According to the expert, President Trump is expected to sign the executive order this week, which could transform the landscape of American retirement investing. As noted by the sources, the order would open up 401(k) retirement plans to alternative investments beyond the traditional stocks and bonds. This move could pave the way for assets like cryptocurrencies, private equity, and real estate to enter mainstream retirement portfolios. These investments would run a broad spectrum of asset classes, ranging from digital assets to precious metals, specialized funds focused on corporate takeovers, private loans, and large-scale infrastructure deals.

2025-07-18 23:30:57+00:00,Bitcoin Sees Long-Term Holders Sell As Short-Term Buyers Step In – Sign Of Rally Exhaustion?,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues to set new all-time highs (ATH) – reaching $123,218 on Binance on July 13 – on-chain data reveals a shift in holder behavior that could threaten the cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum. Bitcoin Holder Rotation May Derail Rally According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor IT Tech, long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) – those holding BTC for over 155 days – have transitioned into net distribution, suggesting seasoned investors are engaging in profit-taking. Meanwhile, short-term holders (STH) – those who have held BTC for less than 155 days — have recently turned net positive, indicating they are buying into BTC’s current rally in anticipation of further gains. Historical data shows that similar trends among LTH and STH were observed back in April 2021 and November 2023. During both these instances, BTC witnessed a cooling phase or a local top when spot demand faded. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Inflows Spike After $123,000 Peak – Signs Of Short-Term Cooling? In their analysis, IT Tech suggested keeping an eye on exchange inflows and funding rates for confirmation. If spot BTC inflows to crypto exchanges surge, it could hint that sell-pressure is likely to increase, which may derail the digital asset’s bullish trajectory. Supporting this view, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain noted that the Spent Output Value Ranges (SOVR) indicator shows a spike in BTC transfers to exchanges from wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC – typically associated with whales. For the uninitiated, the SOVR indicator tracks on-chain BTC transfers by value buckets to identify which investor segments are active. It helps reveal whether retail, mid-sized, or institutional players are driving market activity. This aligns with IT Tech’s observations on long-term holders. If selling pressure intensifies, BTC could correct down to a support level near $111,800. Not All Analysts See Rally Exhaustion Although Bitcoin LTH entering distribution phase, and whales increasing their deposits to crypto exchanges may point toward a potential end for the current rally, not all analysts share the same sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Spikes Without Price Drop – Strong Demand Or Delayed Reaction? For instance, the STH Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) suggests BTC may still be undervalued, indicating potential for further upside. If that holds, Bitcoin could climb as high as $150,000 before any major pullback. Additionally, a fresh injection of $2 billion in liquidity to major crypto derivatives platforms could help reignite bullish momentum. However, caution remains warranted. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has been climbing steadily, giving early signs of an overheated market. At press time, BTC trades at $118,754, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

Additionally, a fresh injection of $2 billion in liquidity to major crypto derivatives platforms could help reignite bullish momentum. However, caution remains warranted. The Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross has been climbing steadily, giving early signs of an overheated market. At press time, BTC trades at $118,754, up 0.4% in the past 24 hours.

2025-07-18 23:45:24+00:00,Bitcoin Acquisition: Aether Holdings’ Revolutionary $40M Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: Aether Holdings’ Revolutionary $40M Strategy In a move that underscores the evolving landscape of corporate finance, Aether Holdings, a prominent financial technology platform company, has announced a significant $40 million offering. What makes this announcement particularly noteworthy for the cryptocurrency world is the company’s explicit intention to allocate the majority of these funds towards a strategic Bitcoin acquisition . This bold decision, reported by BWEnews on X, places Aether Holdings squarely in the spotlight as a Nasdaq-listed entity embracing digital assets as a core component of its treasury strategy. Unpacking Aether Holdings’ Investment Strategy Aether Holdings, with a current market capitalization of $160.46 million, is making a clear statement about its long-term vision. The $40 million offering is not just about raising capital; it’s about strategically deploying it into an asset class that many traditional financial institutions are still hesitant to fully embrace. This commitment to a substantial Bitcoin acquisition reflects a growing confidence in the digital currency’s role as a store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. For a company operating in the financial technology sector, this move could be seen as both a natural progression and a pioneering step. It aligns with the ethos of innovation that fintech companies often embody, while also setting a precedent for how public companies might manage their reserves in an increasingly digital economy. The decision to prioritize Bitcoin in their treasury management speaks volumes about their outlook on future economic conditions and the potential for digital assets to outperform traditional investments. Why Bitcoin Now? The Rise of Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Aether Holdings is not operating in a vacuum. Its decision to adopt a corporate Bitcoin strategy is part of a broader trend that has seen several high-profile companies integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, advocating for its superiority as a treasury reserve asset over fiat currencies susceptible to inflation. So, why are more companies, including Nasdaq-listed ones, turning to Bitcoin? Several factors are at play: Inflation Hedge: With global quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, companies are seeking assets that can preserve or even grow purchasing power. Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive alternative to depreciating fiat currencies. Store of Value: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s scarcity and decentralized nature make it a compelling long-term store of value, attracting corporations looking to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional cash and bonds. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering companies an opportunity for substantial returns on their treasury investments. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin can help diversify a company’s treasury, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. This evolving perspective highlights a fundamental shift in how corporate treasurers view their responsibilities, moving beyond mere liquidity management to active capital appreciation through strategic digital asset allocation. The Broader Trend: Accelerating Institutional Crypto Adoption Aether Holdings’ move is a powerful indicator of accelerating institutional crypto adoption . While retail investors have driven much of Bitcoin’s early growth, the entry of publicly traded companies, asset managers, and financial institutions lends significant legitimacy and stability to the cryptocurrency market. This wave of institutional interest is characterized by: Increased Regulatory Clarity: As regulators worldwide begin to establish clearer frameworks for digital assets, institutions feel more comfortable entering the space. Improved Infrastructure: The development of secure custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and institutional-grade trading platforms has made it easier and safer for large entities to acquire and manage digital assets. Growing Investor Demand: Shareholders and clients are increasingly looking for exposure to digital assets, pressuring companies and funds to incorporate them into their offerings or treasury strategies. The commitment from companies like Aether Holdings signals a maturation of the crypto market, transforming it from a niche investment into a recognized asset class within mainstream finance. Benefits and Risks of a Digital Asset Treasury Embracing a digital asset treasury strategy, particularly one centered on Bitcoin, comes with a unique set of benefits and challenges that companies must carefully weigh. Potential Benefits: Asset Appreciation: The most evident benefit is the potential for significant capital gains if Bitcoin’s value continues to climb.

2025-07-18 23:53:47+00:00,Treasury Chief hails GENIUS Act as milestone in digital currency race,"Treasury Secretary Bessent has hailed signing the GENIUS Act as a “milestone achievement” for cryptocurrency regulation, marking what many see as a historic moment for the digital asset industry. The legislation, passed with bipartisan support in the US House, establishes a clear federal framework for digital assets, addressing key areas such as stablecoins, custody, and market structure. Ian De Bode, chief strategy officer at Ondo Finance, said the bill opens the door for companies like his to expand operations nationwide, calling it “the start of a new regulatory era.” Speaking with news outlets, he said clear regulations are essential for major financial institutions to participate in digital asset infrastructure. He explained that the lack of legal clarity was the biggest barrier and added that clearer rules would lead to faster adoption. He also noted the involvement of Patrick McHenry, former Chair of the House Financial Services Committee and now Vice Chair at Ondo Finance. McHenry was with former President Donald Trump when the bill was signed. GENIUS Act sparks market optimism Crypto markets rallied on news of the GENIUS Act’s passage, and major digital currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) gained momentum. This is no coincidence, industry leaders say. Lukas Enzersdorfer-Konrad, Deputy CEO of Bitpanda, said the move shapes investor sentiment in the crypto space. He noted that the milestone drives broad market optimism, attributing the recent Bitcoin rally and growing interest in altcoins like XRP and DOGE to increased regulatory clarity. He added that investors need certainty to commit for the long term, and that certainty comes from clear, enforceable rules. Apart from these fluctuations, the bill could change how investment firms and hedge funds deploy capital. Obtaining prescribed rules will make it easier for institutions to manage risks when categorising types of crypto assets, trading platforms, and consumer safety. Tae Oh, CEO of Gluwa, focused on the bill’s impact on stablecoins. He said the GENIUS Act marks a major first step in establishing a federal framework for USD-pegged stablecoins. He described it as a strong endorsement of responsible innovation, consumer protection, and the potential for a competitive and dynamic global stablecoin industry. He explained that the bill forms the groundwork for adopting digital assets into the broader financial infrastructure, particularly payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), and cross-border transactions. He said that when the fog clears on regulations, trust in stablecoins is a legitimate tool for everyday finance. Oh, also underscored the significance of the pending Federal Reserve policy meeting, adding that it would only take a hint of a policy pivot to have a big impact on risk asset classes, including crypto. US aligns with global crypto regulation trend The GENIUS Act and other similar efforts have been part of a global effort to create boundaries around the digital asset space. Analysts say the United States is starting to move in line with regulatory efforts in other large economies. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which is being transposed into law across all Member States, provides a continental point of reference. Offering a single market for the issuance, trading, and storing of crypto assets, MiCA already has companies lining up for a regulatory jurisdiction in Europe. Similar measures are being developed in Singapore, South Korea, and Japan, whose digital asset guidelines will adapt to the fast-paced digital innovation. These developments, seen in combination, suggest that policymakers worldwide are increasingly of one mind: the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but not at the cost of hampering innovation. However, global strategies vary. Some, especially in the Global South, emphasize the redesign of financial infrastructure, while others, as with the US SEC, persist in enforcement using securities laws.

Karthik Sarma, who now spearheads SRS Investment Management, sold all of the hedge fund’s massive investment in Nvidia (NVDA) between Q1 of 2024 and Q1 of 2025. Now, new 13F filings show Sarma has piled about $334 million, purchasing 4.74 million shares, into Tapestry (TPR). The luxury goods company, known for its premium handbag and accessories brands like Coach and Kate Spade, has seen its stock surge over 100% in the past 12 months. Tapestry specializes in designing and retailing high-end fashion accessories, leveraging its iconic brands to capture the growing demand for luxury lifestyle products. The company’s strong cash flows and strategic share-repurchase program may have also caught Sarma’s eye, with SRS Investment Management now allocating about 4.5% of the hedge fund’s portfolio to the new investment. That makes Tapestry the fourth-largest allocation at SRS, following Pdd Holdings Inc. at 6.45%, Planet Fitness Inc. at 6.09%, and Meta Platforms Inc. at 5.75%, highlighting a strategic focus on e-commerce, fitness, AI and tech, alongside luxury retail.

This remarkable achievement isn’t just a number; it represents a powerful testament to Bitcoin’s enduring strength, growing adoption, and its potential as a global store of value. For investors, enthusiasts, and even skeptics, this latest milestone prompts a crucial question: what exactly is driving this monumental rise, and what does it signify for the future of finance? Understanding the Monumental BTC Surge: What Does $118,000 Mean? When we talk about a BTC surge past such a formidable level, it’s essential to grasp the sheer significance. Reaching $118,000 is not merely an incremental gain; it often indicates a breakthrough past major psychological resistance levels or even, depending on the market cycle, a new all-time high. This specific price point reflects renewed investor confidence and substantial capital inflow. Historically, Bitcoin’s price movements are characterized by periods of consolidation followed by explosive rallies, often fueled by a confluence of factors. This latest move could signal the beginning of another significant leg up in its long-term trajectory. It underscores the increasing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies and their growing integration into traditional financial systems. Consider the journey Bitcoin has taken since its inception. From humble beginnings to now commanding such a high valuation, each milestone, especially a significant one like $118,000, reinforces its position as a leading financial innovation. This price action serves as a powerful indicator of demand outstripping supply, a fundamental economic principle driving value. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Rally? The ascent of Bitcoin price to new heights is rarely due to a single cause. Instead, it’s typically a complex interplay of macroeconomic trends, institutional interest, supply dynamics, and evolving market sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of digital assets. Institutional Embrace: The Big Players Are In One of the most significant catalysts behind recent Bitcoin rallies has been the growing embrace from institutional investors and large corporations. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously added substantial amounts of Bitcoin to their balance sheets, viewing it as a superior treasury reserve asset. Furthermore, the approval and success of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have opened the floodgates for traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. These ETFs represent a massive pipeline for capital from pension funds, endowments, and wealth managers, providing a level of legitimacy and accessibility previously unavailable. This institutional demand creates consistent buying pressure, underpinning the rally. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: Inflation and Interest Rates In an era of fluctuating inflation rates and evolving central bank policies, Bitcoin’s narrative as a ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against inflation has gained considerable traction. As traditional currencies face inflationary pressures, investors seek alternative stores of value that are decentralized and supply-capped. Bitcoin, with its fixed supply of 21 million coins, presents an attractive option. Additionally, a dovish stance by central banks, leading to lower interest rates, can make yield-bearing traditional assets less appealing, pushing investors towards higher-growth, risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Supply Dynamics: Halving and Scarcity Bitcoin undergoes a ‘halving’ event approximately every four years, which cuts the reward for mining new blocks by half. This mechanism is hardcoded into Bitcoin’s protocol, ensuring its scarcity. Each halving reduces the rate at which new Bitcoin enters circulation, thereby increasing its inherent scarcity over time. Post-halving periods have historically been followed by significant bull runs, as reduced supply meets growing demand. While the most recent halving might be some time ago, its long-term effects on supply dynamics continue to influence the market’s perception of Bitcoin’s value. Retail Resurgence: The People’s Power While institutional money provides significant buying power, the collective interest of retail investors should not be underestimated. Social media trends, mainstream news coverage, and the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) often drive substantial retail participation.

2025-07-19 00:50:18+00:00,Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling the Surging Optimism in the Market,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Unveiling the Surging Optimism in the Market Are you feeling the buzz in the crypto air? The digital asset landscape is constantly shifting, driven by a myriad of factors, not least of which is the collective psyche of its participants. At the heart of understanding this ebb and flow lies a crucial indicator: the Crypto Fear & Greed Index . This fascinating tool offers a snapshot of the prevailing crypto market sentiment , helping investors gauge whether euphoria or panic reigns supreme. As of July 19, the index has climbed to a notable 74, firmly placing it in the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto journey? Unveiling the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Tell Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a brainchild of the software development platform Alternative, is more than just a number; it’s a barometer for the emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, this index distills complex market data into a single, digestible score: 0-24 (Extreme Fear): This indicates that investors are highly worried. Such periods often present buying opportunities for those brave enough to go against the crowd. 25-49 (Fear): While not as intense as extreme fear, this still suggests a cautious or bearish outlook among market participants. 50-74 (Greed): This is where the market currently sits at 74. It signifies growing optimism and a strong buying interest. However, it can also be a precursor to market corrections if euphoria becomes excessive. 75-100 (Extreme Greed): At this level, investors are often overly confident and may be making impulsive decisions. This phase can signal that the market is overheated and due for a pullback. The index aims to prevent investors from making irrational decisions driven by emotional responses. When the market is in ‘Extreme Fear’, it could be a sign of a buying opportunity for long-term investors. Conversely, when the market is in ‘Extreme Greed’, it might be a signal to take profits. Decoding Crypto Market Sentiment: The Six Pillars of the Index How does the index arrive at its score? It’s not just a gut feeling; it’s a sophisticated aggregation of six key market factors, each weighted differently to reflect its influence on overall crypto market sentiment . Understanding these components is essential to truly grasp the index’s insights: Factor Weighting Explanation Volatility 25% Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them with average values over 30 and 90 days. Higher volatility often indicates fear. Market Momentum/Volume 25% Analyzes the current volume and momentum of the market. High buying volumes in a positive market suggest greedy behavior. Social Media 15% Scans social media platforms (primarily Twitter) for keywords and hashtags related to cryptocurrency, assessing the sentiment of discussions. Surveys 15% Polls thousands of crypto investors each week to gather their direct perceptions of the market. (Note: This factor is currently paused.) Bitcoin Dominance 10% Examines Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market capitalization. A rising dominance can indicate a shift of funds from altcoins to Bitcoin, often seen as a safer haven in uncertain times. Google Trends 10% Analyzes Google search data for crypto-related terms. A surge in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” often signals fear, while “buy Bitcoin” suggests greed. Each factor contributes to the final score, providing a holistic view of the market’s emotional state. The current reading of 74 suggests a strong collective belief in upward price movement, but it’s vital to look beyond just the number. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Implications for Investor Sentiment The index’s climb to 74 and its consistent presence in the ‘Greed’ zone reflects a significant shift in investor sentiment . After periods of fear or uncertainty, a move into greed suggests renewed confidence and a willingness to take on more risk. This can be driven by positive news, a sustained price rally, or a general feeling of optimism spreading through the community. However, the ‘Greed’ zone, especially as it approaches ‘Extreme Greed’, comes with a caveat. Historically, periods of extreme euphoria have often preceded market corrections. When everyone is buying, and prices are soaring, the market can become overextended. This is when the fear of missing out (FOMO) kicks in, pushing even cautious investors to enter the market at potentially unsustainable levels. Smart investors often view extreme greed as a signal to exercise caution, rather than to jump in headfirst. The Crucial Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics One of the intriguing components of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is Bitcoin dominance .

2025-07-19 01:00:22+00:00,Michael Saylor Reveals The Only Thing ‘Better Than Bitcoin’ As MSTR Stock Outperforms,"Doubling down on his unwavering belief in the leading cryptocurrency, MicroStrategy’s founder Michael Saylor , has declared that the only thing better than Bitcoin (BTC) is more Bitcoin. Backed by real data, Saylor’s bold conviction appears justified, with MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) spiking rapidly and outperforming BTC’s rally. MSTR Outpaces Bitcoin And Wall Street Giants Saylor is reinforcing his long-held stance on Bitcoin, now claiming in a recent X social media post that the only thing better than BTC in recent years is acquiring more of the flagship cryptocurrency. According to data from a well-curated horizontal bar chart by Strategy B, MicroStrategy’s stock has delivered an eye-popping 3,588% return during what’s being called the “Bitcoin Standard era.” More interestingly, the charts also show that MicroStrategy’s impressive pump has far outpaced Bitcoin’s price surge , which recorded a 905% gain over the same period. This stark contrast underscores a more than 3X outperformance by MSTR compared to BTC, highlighting the amplified returns from Saylor’s aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy . Notably, Saylor’s bold assertion that “the only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin” reflects not only the amazing performance of the cryptocurrency but also the exponential effect of aligning corporate strategy around it. This era-defining performance has placed MSTR at the top of the chart, eclipsing even Wall Street giants and traditional equity benchmarks such as QQQ (up 106%), SPY (up 86%), and GLD (up 62%). Even more striking is the underperformance of Real Estate (VNQ) and bond funds (BND), which delivered just 9% and 19% gains, respectively—a stark contrast in a market where capital allocation has never mattered more. Over the past few years, MicroStrategy has taken an unapologetically competitive approach towards Bitcoin accumulation, converting large portions of its balance sheet into BTC and using both equity and convertible debt to purchase more coins . While the flagship cryptocurrency remains the best-performing asset of the decade by most traditional standards, Saylor’s leveraged BTC play through MSTR has proven to be one of the most explosive and profitable bets . MSTR Stocks Hit Highest Market Cap Value On July 16, Saylor took to X again to announce that MSTR stocks have reached its highest market capitalization to date, closing the day at $455.90 per share after a 3.05% jump. This development marks a major milestone for the company, which now commands a total market cap of $128.5 billion and an enterprise value of $140.2 billion. Notably, the rally is being driven by strong performance in both MSTR shares and BTC, which the company has accumulated in large amounts over the past few years. MicroStrategy’s valuation is anchored in its massive Bitcoin reserve of 601,550 BTC, now worth more than $72.1 billion. With the cryptocurrency priced at $119,887 at the time of the post, Saylor’s leveraged bet has outpaced the asset’s performance.

2025-07-19 01:00:49+00:00,BlockDAG Turns Heads With NO VESTING PASS Offer Giving 100% Coin Access As Snorter Builds Hype,"Bitcoin’s climb to new heights has set the crypto scene buzzing again. Telegram bots and new presale coins are everywhere, but not every option brings the same value. Two names are making the rounds this week: Snorter bot and BlockDAG (BDAG) . While Snorter’s presale price continues to rise, catching eyes from degen circles, BlockDAG with $342M presale, is pulling serious attention for a much bigger reason, full coin unlocks at launch. Most new projects hold back buyer coins in phases, but BlockDAG’s ‘NO VESTING PASS’ skips that completely for the next 8 days. It gives total access from day one. For anyone looking for quick liquidity, BlockDAG might be the clearest opportunity in today’s crowded presale space. Snorter Rises Fast While Vesting Holds Back Snorter token’s presale value is increasing fast as its next stage approaches. The rise has brought in crypto fans hoping to catch gains early. Snorter is built around a Telegram-based trading bot that makes buying and selling simple. This tool is made for meme coin fans and Telegram users who want quick trades without leaving chat. It uses smart contracts to make instant swaps possible right from the Telegram app. This ease of use is what’s driving the excitement. But there’s a catch: vesting. Like many presale offerings, Snorter sends coins in steps, not all at once. Buyers won’t get full access to their coins right away. That works for some, but others see it as a drawback, especially in fast markets where timing matters. Waiting for coins to unlock can lead to missed chances. And in a fast world like crypto, those delays can cost. BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS Offers Full Coin Access Day One While Snorter token grabs some attention, BlockDAG is moving at a much faster pace, and with bigger results. It has already raised $342 million over 29 batches and sold 24 billion coins so far. But what really makes BlockDAG different right now is its ‘NO VESTING PASS’, available for the next 8 days. Any coins bought directly by users with this pass will be 100% unlocked at launch. That means buyers can trade or hold their BDAG coins right from day one, no waiting, no slow unlocks. However, BlockDAG makes things clear. Only coins bought directly during this time come unlocked. Referral bonuses and extra promotions still follow standard unlock rules. This isn’t just a limited-time push, it’s part of BlockDAG’s plan to give users full control during the final stage of its presale. And with Bitcoin climbing, timing couldn’t be better. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, and the launch price is set at $0.05. But as part of BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the coin is now available at just $0.0016 until August 11. Those who got in at Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% return. Buyers at today’s special GLOBAL LAUNCH release price could see gains of 3,025% based on the launch. Snorter Brings Bot Speed But BlockDAG Brings Liquidity Both Snorter bot and BlockDAG offer different kinds of value to the crypto world. Snorter is focused on meme coin trading through Telegram. Its bot is quick, simple, and built for mobile-first users. The rising price in its presale brings urgency and buzz. But there’s still that delay. Buyers don’t get all their coins at once. That limits their control while the market keeps moving. BlockDAG changes the game. Its NO VESTING PASS means you get full liquidity from day one. You don’t need to wait, you can act the moment it launches. In presales, that kind of instant access is rare. And with BlockDAG’s massive raise, its solid Layer 1 foundation, and global activity, it’s clear why people are switching their focus. Snorter might work for quick trades and hype. But BlockDAG mixes smart timing, real fundamentals, and full access. Final Thoughts Snorter token is gaining ground, and its bot is helping users get into the market with ease. The idea fits today’s meme coin trend. But with coins being locked up over time, buyers can’t use their full purchase right away. That limits fast action. BlockDAG stands out by doing the opposite. With its NO VESTING PASS, buyers get every coin unlocked on launch day. No delays. Just full access. With $342 million raised, 24 billion coins sold, and a 3,025% potential return from the current $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price to the official $0.05, BlockDAG is clearly setting itself up as a leader. For those who want control, timing, and liquidity, BlockDAG is offering something rare, and that offer only lasts 8 more days.

Two names are making the rounds this week: Snorter bot and BlockDAG (BDAG) . While Snorter’s presale price continues to rise, catching eyes from degen circles, BlockDAG with $342M presale, is pulling serious attention for a much bigger reason, full coin unlocks at launch. Most new projects hold back buyer coins in phases, but BlockDAG’s ‘NO VESTING PASS’ skips that completely for the next 8 days. It gives total access from day one. For anyone looking for quick liquidity, BlockDAG might be the clearest opportunity in today’s crowded presale space. Snorter Rises Fast While Vesting Holds Back Snorter token’s presale value is increasing fast as its next stage approaches. The rise has brought in crypto fans hoping to catch gains early. Snorter is built around a Telegram-based trading bot that makes buying and selling simple. This tool is made for meme coin fans and Telegram users who want quick trades without leaving chat. It uses smart contracts to make instant swaps possible right from the Telegram app. This ease of use is what’s driving the excitement. But there’s a catch: vesting. Like many presale offerings, Snorter sends coins in steps, not all at once. Buyers won’t get full access to their coins right away. That works for some, but others see it as a drawback, especially in fast markets where timing matters. Waiting for coins to unlock can lead to missed chances. And in a fast world like crypto, those delays can cost. BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS Offers Full Coin Access Day One While Snorter token grabs some attention, BlockDAG is moving at a much faster pace, and with bigger results. It has already raised $342 million over 29 batches and sold 24 billion coins so far. But what really makes BlockDAG different right now is its ‘NO VESTING PASS’, available for the next 8 days. Any coins bought directly by users with this pass will be 100% unlocked at launch. That means buyers can trade or hold their BDAG coins right from day one, no waiting, no slow unlocks. However, BlockDAG makes things clear. Only coins bought directly during this time come unlocked. Referral bonuses and extra promotions still follow standard unlock rules. This isn’t just a limited-time push, it’s part of BlockDAG’s plan to give users full control during the final stage of its presale. And with Bitcoin climbing, timing couldn’t be better. Batch 29 is priced at $0.0276, and the launch price is set at $0.05. But as part of BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the coin is now available at just $0.0016 until August 11. Those who got in at Batch 1 have already seen a 2,660% return. Buyers at today’s special GLOBAL LAUNCH release price could see gains of 3,025% based on the launch. Snorter Brings Bot Speed But BlockDAG Brings Liquidity Both Snorter bot and BlockDAG offer different kinds of value to the crypto world. Snorter is focused on meme coin trading through Telegram. Its bot is quick, simple, and built for mobile-first users. The rising price in its presale brings urgency and buzz. But there’s still that delay. Buyers don’t get all their coins at once. That limits their control while the market keeps moving. BlockDAG changes the game. Its NO VESTING PASS means you get full liquidity from day one. You don’t need to wait, you can act the moment it launches. In presales, that kind of instant access is rare. And with BlockDAG’s massive raise, its solid Layer 1 foundation, and global activity, it’s clear why people are switching their focus. Snorter might work for quick trades and hype. But BlockDAG mixes smart timing, real fundamentals, and full access. Final Thoughts Snorter token is gaining ground, and its bot is helping users get into the market with ease. The idea fits today’s meme coin trend. But with coins being locked up over time, buyers can’t use their full purchase right away. That limits fast action. BlockDAG stands out by doing the opposite. With its NO VESTING PASS, buyers get every coin unlocked on launch day. No delays. Just full access. With $342 million raised, 24 billion coins sold, and a 3,025% potential return from the current $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH release price to the official $0.05, BlockDAG is clearly setting itself up as a leader. For those who want control, timing, and liquidity, BlockDAG is offering something rare, and that offer only lasts 8 more days.

The latest readings from the Altcoin Season Index might explain why. This crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a sobering 37 at 01:14 UTC on July 19, down three points from the previous day’s figure. This decline signals a definitive shift into what the crypto world refers to as Bitcoin Season . For many investors, this means a period where Bitcoin’s price movements dictate the overall crypto market, often leaving altcoins struggling to keep pace. Understanding this dynamic is key to navigating the ever-volatile digital asset landscape. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index, and Why Does it Matter? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it’s a snapshot of market sentiment and capital flow within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Developed and tracked by CoinMarketCap, it provides a clear indication of whether altcoins are broadly outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. How it Works: The index compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially in Altcoin Season, at least 75% of these top 100 altcoins must have outperformed Bitcoin during the 90-day period. The index score typically ranges from 75 to 100. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, Bitcoin Season occurs when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. The index score for Bitcoin Season usually falls between 1 and 25. With the index currently at 37, it clearly indicates that we are firmly outside Altcoin Season territory and deep within a period where Bitcoin is asserting its dominance. This makes the index a vital tool for cryptocurrency analysis , helping investors gauge market trends and adjust their strategies accordingly. Why Has the Market Shifted into Bitcoin Season? Unpacking Current Crypto Market Trends The transition into a pronounced Bitcoin Season isn’t random; it’s often driven by a confluence of macroeconomic factors, market sentiment, and specific industry developments. Several key reasons contribute to Bitcoin’s current dominance: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: In times of global economic instability, high inflation, or rising interest rates, investors tend to de-risk. Within the crypto space, Bitcoin is often perceived as the ‘safer’ asset or ‘digital gold,’ leading to a flight of capital from more speculative altcoins into BTC. Institutional Adoption & Liquidity: The increasing institutional interest, particularly with the advent of Bitcoin ETFs, funnels significant capital directly into Bitcoin. Its unparalleled liquidity and deeper market depth make it the preferred choice for large institutional players, reinforcing its dominance. Bitcoin Halving Cycles: While not the sole factor, the anticipation or aftermath of Bitcoin halvings can create unique market dynamics. Often, pre-halving rallies see Bitcoin gain strength, and post-halving consolidations might also see capital concentrate in BTC as the market absorbs the supply shock. Regulatory Clarity (Relative): Compared to the vast and diverse altcoin landscape, Bitcoin often has a relatively clearer regulatory pathway in many jurisdictions. This reduces perceived risk for both retail and institutional investors, making it a more attractive holding during uncertain regulatory periods. These prevailing crypto market trends collectively contribute to Bitcoin’s current stronghold, making it challenging for most altcoins to generate significant independent gains. Navigating Altcoin Performance: What Does Bitcoin Dominance Mean for Your Portfolio? When the market is in Bitcoin Season , the implications for altcoin performance can be significant and often challenging for investors heavily invested in smaller cap digital assets. Here’s what typically happens: Underperformance: The vast majority of altcoins will underperform Bitcoin, meaning their prices might either decline in USD value or rise much less significantly than BTC. They also tend to lose value against Bitcoin (their BTC pair value drops). Increased Volatility: Smaller, less liquid altcoins can experience heightened volatility, with sharper drops during market corrections and slower recoveries. Capital Rotation: Money often flows out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, exacerbating the altcoin underperformance. Investors might sell altcoins to buy more BTC, or simply hold cash waiting for a shift. The ‘Bleed Out’: Many altcoins may experience a gradual decline, often referred to as ‘bleeding out,’ where their value erodes over time, especially against Bitcoin. While some strong altcoins with unique narratives or significant developments might still manage to post gains, they are typically outliers. The prevailing environment demands a cautious approach to altcoin investments.

Ethereum NUPL Fell Into Capitulation Zone Earlier In a new post on X, Glassnode has talked about an Ethereum indicator from its joint report with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The metric in question is the “Net Unrealized Profit/Loss,” which measures, as its name suggests, the net amount of profit or loss that the investors of the asset as a whole are holding right now. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Flashes Signal That Last Led To 630% Surge The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin on the network to see what price it was last moved at. If this previous transfer value was more than the current spot price for any token, then that particular token is assumed be in a state of net unrealized loss. Similarly, a coin with a cost basis below the latest price is considered in profit. The NUPL sums up the degree of profit/loss involved in both cases and calculates the difference between them. When the value of the indicator is positive, it means the investors as a whole are sitting in a state of net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the zero mark implies the dominance of loss in the market. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL over the past few years: As is visible in the above graph, the Ethereum NUPL observed a significant decline earlier in the year when the asset’s price plummeted. In this plunge, the indicator went down to around -0.2, which suggests investors dipped into a net state of loss. Not just that, the level of relative unrealized loss present on the network was notable enough for the sentiment to be flagged as “capitulation” under Glassnode’s methodology.

2025-07-19 02:40:18+00:00,Crypto ETFs: 21Shares’ Pivotal Momentum with New SEC Filings for FTSE Indexes,"BitcoinWorld Crypto ETFs: 21Shares’ Pivotal Momentum with New SEC Filings for FTSE Indexes The world of cryptocurrency investment is constantly evolving, and a recent development from 21Shares is certainly making waves. If you’ve been following the journey of digital assets into mainstream finance, you know that the approval of a Crypto ETFs has been a long-awaited milestone. Now, we’re seeing significant strides towards that future, potentially opening new avenues for investors seeking exposure to this dynamic asset class. What’s Behind 21Shares’ Latest SEC Filing? On July 18, 21Shares US, a prominent player in the digital asset ETP space, announced a significant move that could reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency investment . They filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for two innovative new funds: the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF and the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF. The first, the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF , aims to track a market cap-weighted index comprising the world’s ten largest crypto assets. This means it offers broad exposure to the top performers in the digital asset space, providing a diversified entry point for investors. The second, the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF , follows an FTSE Russell index specifically designed to exclude Bitcoin. This provides an alternative for investors seeking diversification beyond the largest cryptocurrency, focusing on the broader altcoin market. This latest SEC filing highlights 21Shares’ continued commitment to bringing regulated, accessible investment products to the U.S. market, building on their existing presence and experience in the European digital asset space. Why are FTSE Indexes Significant for These Crypto ETFs? The choice to track FTSE indexes is a critical aspect of these new filings. FTSE Russell is a globally recognized provider of indexes, known for its rigorous methodology and independent governance. Their involvement adds a layer of credibility and familiarity for traditional investors who might be hesitant about direct crypto exposure. For a Crypto ETFs to track an index from a reputable provider like FTSE Russell means: Standardization: It provides a clear, transparent, and rules-based methodology for asset selection and weighting, ensuring consistency and reliability. Credibility: Lends institutional legitimacy to the underlying crypto assets, potentially attracting a broader range of investors who trust established financial benchmarks. Accessibility: Makes it easier for financial advisors and institutional investors to integrate crypto exposure into diversified portfolios, as they are already familiar with FTSE Russell’s benchmarks.

BitcoinWorld Crypto ETFs: 21Shares’ Pivotal Momentum with New SEC Filings for FTSE Indexes The world of cryptocurrency investment is constantly evolving, and a recent development from 21Shares is certainly making waves. If you’ve been following the journey of digital assets into mainstream finance, you know that the approval of a Crypto ETFs has been a long-awaited milestone. Now, we’re seeing significant strides towards that future, potentially opening new avenues for investors seeking exposure to this dynamic asset class. What’s Behind 21Shares’ Latest SEC Filing? On July 18, 21Shares US, a prominent player in the digital asset ETP space, announced a significant move that could reshape the landscape of cryptocurrency investment . They filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for two innovative new funds: the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF and the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF. The first, the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 Index ETF , aims to track a market cap-weighted index comprising the world’s ten largest crypto assets. This means it offers broad exposure to the top performers in the digital asset space, providing a diversified entry point for investors. The second, the 21Shares FTSE Crypto 10 ex-BTC Index ETF , follows an FTSE Russell index specifically designed to exclude Bitcoin. This provides an alternative for investors seeking diversification beyond the largest cryptocurrency, focusing on the broader altcoin market. This latest SEC filing highlights 21Shares’ continued commitment to bringing regulated, accessible investment products to the U.S. market, building on their existing presence and experience in the European digital asset space. Why are FTSE Indexes Significant for These Crypto ETFs? The choice to track FTSE indexes is a critical aspect of these new filings. FTSE Russell is a globally recognized provider of indexes, known for its rigorous methodology and independent governance. Their involvement adds a layer of credibility and familiarity for traditional investors who might be hesitant about direct crypto exposure. For a Crypto ETFs to track an index from a reputable provider like FTSE Russell means: Standardization: It provides a clear, transparent, and rules-based methodology for asset selection and weighting, ensuring consistency and reliability. Credibility: Lends institutional legitimacy to the underlying crypto assets, potentially attracting a broader range of investors who trust established financial benchmarks. Accessibility: Makes it easier for financial advisors and institutional investors to integrate crypto exposure into diversified portfolios, as they are already familiar with FTSE Russell’s benchmarks. This collaboration underscores a growing trend where established financial infrastructure is adapting to accommodate digital assets, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world.

2025-07-19 03:10:15+00:00,"Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal: 1,000 BTC Leaves Binance from New Wallets","BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal: 1,000 BTC Leaves Binance from New Wallets The world of cryptocurrency is a fascinating realm, often characterized by rapid movements and significant transactions that can send ripples across the market. Recently, a notable event captured the attention of the crypto community: a substantial Bitcoin withdrawal from one of the industry’s largest exchanges, Binance. This isn’t just any transaction; it involves a staggering 1,000 BTC, valued at approximately $118 million at the time of the move, originating from fresh addresses. Such a large BTC transfer immediately sparks curiosity and speculation among traders and analysts alike. What does it mean when a significant amount of Bitcoin moves off an exchange? Let’s dive deep into the implications of this intriguing development. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Withdrawal from Binance On-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, leveraging data from Arkham Intelligence, recently brought to light a significant movement of Bitcoin. Two newly created addresses initiated a withdrawal of 1,000 BTC from Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange. This event, while seemingly straightforward, carries considerable weight within the crypto ecosystem. When a substantial amount of an asset like Bitcoin is removed from an exchange, it often signals a shift in strategy or intent from the holders. Here’s a breakdown of the core details: Asset Involved: 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Origin: Binance exchange Destination: Two newly created, previously inactive addresses Reported By: Lookonchain, citing Arkham data Approximate Value: $118 million (at the time of the transfer) This kind of movement is meticulously tracked by on-chain analysts because it provides valuable insights into market dynamics and potential future price action. The fact that the addresses are ‘fresh’ or ‘new’ adds another layer of intrigue, suggesting that these might not be routine internal transfers or rebalancing acts by the exchange itself. Why Does a Large BTC Transfer Matter? In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, every major move can be a signal. A large BTC transfer , especially one of this magnitude, is often interpreted as a significant event for several reasons: Potential Accumulation: When Bitcoin moves off an exchange, it’s often a sign that the holder intends to keep it for the long term, moving it into cold storage or private wallets. This reduces the immediate selling pressure on exchanges and can be seen as a bullish signal, indicating accumulation. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large sums of Bitcoin are frequently traded directly between parties in OTC deals, bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact. Such withdrawals could be precursors to these private transactions. Institutional Activity: Increasingly, institutions are entering the crypto space. These large withdrawals could represent movements by institutional investors, hedge funds, or even sovereign wealth funds looking to secure their assets off-exchange. Security Concerns: Some large holders prefer to store their assets in self-custodied wallets to mitigate risks associated with exchange hacks or regulatory uncertainties. Market Sentiment Indicator: While not always a direct predictor, a consistent trend of large withdrawals can suggest a bullish sentiment, implying holders are confident in Bitcoin’s future value. Conversely, large deposits to exchanges often precede selling pressure. Understanding these potential motivations is crucial for anyone trying to decipher the market’s pulse. It’s rarely just a simple transfer; there’s often a strategic reason behind such substantial moves. Unmasking the Crypto Whale : Who Could Be Behind Such a Move? The term ‘ crypto whale ‘ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices. When 1,000 BTC moves, it’s undeniably a whale-sized transaction. But who are these whales, and what are their typical characteristics? A visualization of a significant Bitcoin transfer from an exchange. Massive Bitcoin Withdrawal: 1,000 BTC Leaves Binance from New Wallets Whales can be diverse: Early Bitcoin Adopters: Individuals who mined or bought Bitcoin in its nascent stages and now hold vast quantities. High-Net-Worth Individuals (HNWIs): Traditional investors diversifying their portfolios with digital assets. Investment Funds & Institutions: Entities like Grayscale, MicroStrategy, or other large investment vehicles accumulating Bitcoin. Centralized Exchanges: Though less likely for ‘new addresses,’ exchanges themselves hold significant reserves for liquidity and operational purposes.

2025-07-19 03:25:18+00:00,Crypto Perpetual Futures: Unveiling the Shocking 24-Hour Liquidation Storm,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Perpetual Futures: Unveiling the Shocking 24-Hour Liquidation Storm In the exhilarating yet unpredictable world of digital assets, volatility is a constant companion. For many involved in advanced crypto trading , the concept of crypto perpetual futures is a familiar one, offering opportunities for amplified gains but also significant risks. One of the most stark indicators of market sentiment and sudden price movements is the phenomenon of liquidation. When the market takes an unexpected turn, leveraged positions can be wiped out in an instant, leading to massive financial shifts. What Are Crypto Perpetual Futures and Why Do They Liquidate? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what we’re discussing. Crypto perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without actually owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures contracts, perpetual futures have no expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. Traders can open both ‘long’ positions (betting on a price increase) and ‘short’ positions (betting on a price decrease). The key to understanding liquidations lies in leverage. Traders use leverage to amplify their potential returns by borrowing funds to open larger positions than their initial capital would allow. While this can magnify profits, it also dramatically increases risk. If the market moves against a leveraged position, and the trader’s margin (the collateral held by the exchange) falls below a certain threshold, the exchange will automatically close the position to prevent further losses – this is called futures liquidation . Essentially, liquidation serves as a safety mechanism for exchanges to ensure traders can cover their losses. For the individual trader, however, it means losing their entire margin and sometimes even more, depending on the exchange’s policies and market conditions. These events often trigger cascading effects, as large liquidations can put further downward (or upward) pressure on prices, leading to more liquidations. The Alarming 24-Hour Futures Liquidation Breakdown The last 24 hours have painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant futures liquidation volumes across major cryptocurrencies. This breakdown reveals the extent to which leveraged positions were impacted, providing crucial insights for anyone involved in crypto trading . Here’s a snapshot of the total crypto perpetual futures liquidation over the last 24 hours: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated Volume Long Liquidations Percentage Ethereum (ETH) $214.42 million 67.76% Bitcoin (BTC) $139.30 million 87.42% XRP $55.91 million 68.59% As you can see, the total liquidation volume across these three assets alone reached an astounding figure, with ETH leading the pack. What’s particularly striking is the overwhelming dominance of ‘long’ liquidations across the board. This indicates that a majority of traders were betting on price increases, only to be caught off guard by a downward price movement, leading to their positions being forcibly closed. Bitcoin Liquidation: Analyzing the Market’s Bellwether Bitcoin, often considered the bellwether of the crypto market, experienced substantial Bitcoin liquidation amounting to $139.30 million. What stands out even more is that a staggering 87.42% of these liquidations were from long positions. This high percentage suggests that many traders were highly confident in BTC’s upward trajectory, perhaps fueled by recent positive news or technical analysis indicators, only for the price to drop unexpectedly, triggering widespread margin calls. Large Bitcoin liquidations can have a ripple effect across the entire crypto ecosystem. As BTC is often the primary trading pair for many altcoins, a significant move in Bitcoin’s price can drag down the broader market, leading to further liquidations in other assets. The high concentration of long liquidations in BTC points to a market that was perhaps over-leveraged on the bullish side, making it particularly vulnerable to a correction. Ethereum Liquidation: The Smart Contract Giant’s Vulnerability Ethereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs, saw the largest individual liquidation volume at $214.42 million. Similar to Bitcoin, a significant portion (67.76%) of these were long liquidations. Ethereum’s price movements are often influenced by its ecosystem developments, but also by the broader market sentiment, especially Bitcoin’s performance. The high volume of Ethereum liquidation suggests that many traders were also optimistic about ETH’s short-term prospects. Given Ethereum’s integral role in the DeFi space, large liquidations can sometimes reflect broader stress in the decentralized lending and borrowing protocols, where ETH is often used as collateral. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for effective crypto trading strategies.

The move suggests persistent bullish momentum following a period of sharp decline earlier this week. As the price inches closer to its all-time high, on-chain data is starting to paint a picture of solid transactional support behind the price movement. In particular, analysts have begun highlighting a divergence between Bitcoin’s market value and its underlying network activity. One such observation comes from CryptoQuant analyst Sunflowr Quant, who shared insights in a recent QuickTake post examining the unusual behavior of the NVT Golden Cross indicator. This metric, typically expected to rise in tandem with price due to its function as a ratio between market cap and transaction volume, is currently declining, which Sunflowr attributes to a significant uptick in on-chain activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Not Over Yet? Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Further Upside Bitcoin On-Chain Growth Suggests Underlying Network Strength According to Sunflowr, this inverse correlation between the rising BTC price and falling NVT Golden Cross may indicate that the current rally is driven more by actual usage and real transactions on the Bitcoin network rather than speculative trading. “A decline in the NVT ratio during a price increase implies that the transaction volume is rising at a faster pace than the market cap,” he wrote. “This can be interpreted as a sign that the rally is supported by real economic activity.” This observation aligns with the broader sentiment that healthy on-chain growth can serve as a foundation for more sustainable price increases. If transaction volumes are growing organically and not solely from derivatives speculation, it suggests that user adoption and financial utility are contributing to the price strength. Investors closely watching these indicators may find this a favorable environment, though caution remains as other metrics hint at evolving market dynamics. Holder Rotation Signals Potential Shift in Market Participation A separate analysis from CryptoQuant analyst IT Tech sheds light on another dimension of Bitcoin’s current market structure: holder behavior. In a post titled “Holder Rotation,” IT Tech notes that long-term holders, those who have held BTC for more than 155 days, have recently begun net distribution, meaning they’re selling more than accumulating. Conversely, short-term holders are showing net accumulation behavior once again, a dynamic often seen in late-stage rallies. This shift between long-term and short-term holders has historically served as a warning signal. Similar handoffs were observed in April 2021 and November 2023, both of which preceded local tops or cooling phases. While this doesn’t necessarily confirm a reversal, it highlights the need to monitor supporting metrics such as exchange inflows and funding rates.

That gut-punch of missing the wave is all too familiar. It’s not about luck. It’s about catching the move before it happens. As 2025 approaches, BlockDAG, XRP, Cardano, and Litecoin are sending out signals that are hard to ignore. From upcoming exchange listings to rising market patterns and growing real-world use, these four names are buzzing. If you’ve been watching from the sidelines, now might be your moment to act before the crowd rushes in. 1. BlockDAG’s No Vesting Offer and Big Exchange Listings Turn Heads BlockDAG (BDAG) is heating up as it approaches its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With 20 exchange listings already confirmed, including names like MEXC, BitMart, Coinstore, and LBank, the visibility is locked in early. What’s catching even more attention is its limited-time NO VESTING PASS, giving buyers full access to their coins at launch with no lockup. This isn’t just talk. BlockDAG has teamed up with the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas, blending blockchain with fan experiences like digital tickets, collectibles, and game-day rewards. With over 200,000 holders and $342 million raised in presale, the momentum is real. At $0.0016 now and a fixed listing price of $0.05, the setup hints at a possible 3,000% gain. Some market watchers are calling for $1 in 2025, with longer-term views going as high as $10. For those searching for the top crypto coins to buy now, BlockDAG’s window might be open, but not for long. 2. XRP Eyes Breakout as Whale Activity and Price Targets Rise XRP is back in the spotlight and quickly being mentioned among the top crypto coins to buy now. After Bitcoin’s recent pump, XRP jumped more than 6%, crossing the $2.90 mark. Behind the surge is growing interest from large holders, with whale wallets now holding over 47 billion XRP, a signal that serious activity is heating up. Grayscale has also added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund, and Ripple is working toward a U.S. national bank charter, boosting credibility. With daily trading volume now over 9 billion, analysts are watching closely. Price targets of $3.40 are in sight, with $4.35 and even $8 by 2025 now part of the conversation. 3. Cardano Sees Momentum as DeFi Grows and Signals Flash Green Cardano (ADA) is starting to show real momentum again. After four straight green candles, its price is sitting around $0.73. A major bullish signal came when ADA broke above its 200-day moving average, a key technical point for many traders. At the same time, Cardano’s DeFi presence is growing fast. The total value locked has surged to $326 million, up 21% since the end of June. Whale wallets have been active too, collecting over 1.28 billion ADA. The chart even flashed a golden cross, another signal often tied to price runs. With rising activity and renewed strength, ADA is gaining attention once more, with some targets reaching up to $3.50 by 2026. 4. Litecoin Moves with Bitcoin, Eyes Break Above $100 Litecoin (LTC) is starting to wake up. The price has bounced to around $94 after recovering from support near $77.50. Momentum is turning positive again, backed by technical signs like a fair value gap between $88 and $90 that many see as bullish. What’s also worth noting is LTC’s strong connection with Bitcoin; it moves with BTC 88% of the time. That link gives traders confidence when the larger market turns bullish. If Litecoin breaks past $98.36, the path could open toward $102.93, $107.11, or even a possible 4x surge over time. Wrap Up! Markets are moving fast, and XRP, Cardano, and Litecoin are all flashing signs of growth. XRP is backed by whales and institutions, Cardano is gaining fast in DeFi, and Litecoin is riding strong Bitcoin momentum with bullish signals. BlockDAG is standing out too, with 20 exchange listings confirmed, over $342 million raised, and real-world partnerships in place. The price remains locked at $0.0016, and the no vesting pass gives full access at launch. With interest rising, all four are shaping up to be serious picks among the top crypto coins to buy now .

Imagine nearly a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, 7,743 BTC to be exact, suddenly shifting from a major exchange like Coinbase to an unknown digital vault. This isn’t just a routine transfer; it’s a significant event that captures the attention of traders, analysts, and enthusiasts alike, prompting questions about its potential implications for the broader crypto market impact . What Just Happened? Decoding the Massive Coinbase Transaction On a recent report, the prominent blockchain tracking service Whale Alert flagged an enormous Coinbase transaction . Specifically, 7,743 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $916 million at the time of transfer, was moved from a Coinbase wallet to a newly created, previously unknown address. This kind of large BTC movement is always noteworthy, but its sheer size makes it particularly compelling. For context, such a transfer represents a significant portion of the daily trading volume on many exchanges, highlighting the immense capital controlled by these so-called ‘whales’. Transaction Details: 7,743 BTC Estimated Value: Approximately $916,000,000 Origin: Coinbase exchange wallet Destination: An unknown, new Bitcoin address Reported by: Whale Alert This single transaction underscores the power and influence of individual or institutional holders in the volatile cryptocurrency space. When such a substantial amount of Bitcoin changes hands, especially moving off an exchange, it often signals a strategic maneuver rather than a casual transfer. Why Does a Large BTC Movement Matter to the Crypto Market? The immediate question on everyone’s mind when a large BTC movement occurs is: what does it mean for the crypto market impact ? These massive transfers can be interpreted in several ways, each with different implications for Bitcoin’s price and market sentiment. Understanding these potential scenarios is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space. Potential Interpretations: Accumulation for Long-Term Holding: When large amounts of Bitcoin move from an exchange (where they are typically held for trading) to an unknown wallet, it often suggests the owner intends to hold them for the long term, away from immediate trading impulses. This is generally considered a bullish sign, as it reduces the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. OTC (Over-The-Counter) Deal: The transfer could be part of an over-the-counter deal, where a large block of Bitcoin is sold directly to an institutional buyer or another large investor, bypassing public exchanges to minimize market impact. While the sale itself happens off-exchange, the movement of funds to a new wallet might be the settlement of such a deal. Exchange Internal Restructuring: Less likely for an “unknown new wallet,” but exchanges sometimes move funds between their own cold storage or hot wallets for security or operational reasons. However, the “unknown new wallet” descriptor usually points away from this. Preparation for Sale: Conversely, the transfer could be a precursor to a large sell-off. If the funds are moved to a different exchange or a wallet linked to an OTC desk, it could signal an impending liquidation. However, moving to an entirely new, unknown wallet typically points to holding. The ambiguity of the “unknown new wallet” adds to the intrigue. Is it a new institutional player entering the market, a seasoned investor rebalancing their portfolio, or something else entirely? The market watches these events closely, as they can sometimes precede significant price swings. Unmasking the Influence of the Bitcoin Whale Who exactly is a Bitcoin whale , and why do their actions command so much attention? In the cryptocurrency lexicon, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding an extremely large amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. In Bitcoin’s case, a whale typically holds thousands of BTC. Their sheer capital allows them to make moves that can either absorb significant sell pressure or create it, depending on their intentions. The presence of whales is a double-edged sword for the crypto market: Market Stability vs. Volatility: Whales can provide liquidity and stability by accumulating during downturns. However, a sudden large sell-off by a whale can trigger cascading price drops, leading to increased volatility. Price Discovery: Their large trades can sometimes dictate short-term price movements, making it challenging for smaller investors to predict market direction.

That helped him and the financial news media to easily get a handle on some of the high tech sector’s most capitalized and best performing stocks. In other words, a 2025 era pivot to cross stitching Coinbase, Robinhood, Palantir, and Apploving into one word could mean Cramer is feeling bullish about the crypto industry. But one replier on the comment thread wrote, “Coinbase, Robinhood, Applovin, Palantir (CRAP) what do we think?” New PARC Tag From the Man Who Coined FAANG Coinbase is the leading US crypto exchange with shares up over +50% from Jan. 1 so far in 2025 (at the time of this writing). Robinhood is a US commission free stock trading app and that offers low-fee cryptocurrency trading and staking for ETH and SOL. Meanwhile, Coinbase is doing very well raking in fees from the ongoing Bitcoin bull run. Even the Czech central bank recently disclosed it added $18 million worth of the stock to its balance sheet. Palantir is a US signals intelligence company that develops Internet-based applications for the US intelligence community, police forces, and military as well as private clients. It is leading the charge to use blockchain and AI together to solve complex problems. So, has Cramer suddenly seen the light and now he’s floating a trial ballon to X followers to promote crypto stocks? He’s gone in some recent months from trashing Bitcoin to recommending it on the air. Also noteworthy in this context, on Monday Cramer used an interesting metaphor for deal-making on Wall Street on his program, one that rhymes with one of the top 3 cryptocurrencies by market value, XRP: “You don’t get a wave of deals out of nowhere. You get a ripple, and then ever bigger waves. Right now, we’re in the ripple stage. That’s when it’s best to do some buying.” That’s very bullish for Bitcoin unless Cramer is trying to use the power of “Inverse Cramer” to give cryptocurrencies the hug of death. Weird New Inverse Cramer Form Emerges Incidentally, at least two crypto news media outlets scrambled a message from the Mad Money host into a different sort of Inverse Kramer.

That’s a reasonable position to take in light of that JP Morgan already has a nice moat-protected competitive advantage in finance that doesn’t require going all in on crypto.

2025-07-19 05:26:50+00:00,Crypto Regulation in Brazil 2025,"The post Crypto Regulation in Brazil 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In 2025, Brazil is shaping its regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies as directed by the Brazilian Virtual Assets Law (BVAL). The law became effective in 2023, and it is currently focusing on ensuring transparency, preventing money laundering, and protecting consumers from fraudsters. Brazil has legalised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but they are not considered legal tender. The BVAL established taxation on cryptocurrency trading, which must be reported in the annual tax declaration. Brazil has embraced blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations, which have assisted millions of Brazilians in utilizing digital assets. Let’s explore the crypto regulations in Brazil that changed the topical landscape of digital assets in 2025. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in Brazil Unfolding Crypto Regulation in Brazil 2025 Who Guides Crypto in Brazil? Crypto License in Brazil in 2025 Crypto Tax in Brazil Crypto Adoption Rate in Brazil 2025 Brazil Government Stance on Crypto Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in Brazil June 30, 2025 – Central Bank Temporarily Ceases C&M Software The Central Bank of Brazil immediately issued a notice to temporarily suspend C&M Software after discovering that hackers had stolen approximately $140 million (R$800 million). June 17, 2025 – Introduction of Crypto Tracking Software The National Secretariat of Public Security (SENASP) under Brazil’s Lula Government announced an initiative to track and monitor cryptocurrency transactions . The surveillance tool will be active on major blockchain networks, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tron, Binance, Dash, etc. June 12, 2025 – Brazil’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill passes First Committee Brazil’s strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill 4501/2023 passed the first committee, pushing the country closer to holding $BTC as part of its national reserve. Bill Project No. 4,501 of 2024 “Provides for the formation of a Sovereign Strategic Reserve of Bitcoins by the Federal Government and other measures”, states the proposal of the bill. June 12, 2025 – Crypto Tax Under Provisional Measure 1303, a flat 17.5% tax now applies to all cryptocurrency gains, replacing the former progressive regime. February 17, 2025 – Brazilian Superior Court of Justice (STJ) Subjects Crypto to Seizure in Enforcement Proceedings The Superior Court of Justice in Brazil affirmed that Brazil’s lower courts subpoena crypto exchanges to trace and seize cryptocurrencies held by the debtor. This law was enacted after failing to identify a debtor’s traditional financial assets. It allows the courts to seize crypto assets potentially held by debtors. Unfolding Crypto Regulation in Brazil 2025 Brazil has enacted foundational legislation and is moving toward detailed operational rules and licensing requirements for cryptocurrency in 2025. The procedure is to develop recent implementations and finalize them after thorough examinations. Some key developments in crypto regulations are: The BVAL (Law no. 14,478/22 ) is the first crypto asset law in Brazil, which was implemented in June 2023.
