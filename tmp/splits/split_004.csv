After the officials of New Zealand noted that crypto kiosks mainly attract users seeking anonymity to covert illegal funds, the government took an immediate decision to ban Bitcoin banks. April 1, 2026– Introduction of OECD in Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) CARF, through the Taxation Act 2025, will come into effect in 2025. It aims at enhancing transparency and combating tax evasion in the crypto space while establishing rules for crypto asset services providers (CASPs). Crypto transaction reporting obligations for CASPs will be mandatory under this law . March 31, 2025- Conduct of Financial Institutions (CoFI) Under this legislation, fair conduct principles for financial institutions, including crypto, are compulsory. While this legislation does not directly regulate crypto as a financial product, it does impact how financial institutions dealing with crypto assets conduct themselves. March 2025- Financial Markets Authority (FMA) Regulatory Sandbox FMA announced a regulatory sandbox for 2025, where fintech companies, including developing blockchain corporations, can test innovative products under supervision. It also fosters collaboration between the government and the crypto industry, promoting consumer protection and market integrity. March 29, 2025- Consumer and Product Data Act This law introduces a legislated consumer data right (CDR) in the financial sector. While this law does not directly regulate crypto, it can indirectly impact data rights and data sharing in the digital industry and blockchain developments. What is the New Zealand Government Saying About Crypto? The Financial Market Authority (FMA) is the key regulator of cryptocurrency and digital assets in New Zealand. Currently, the agency is focusing on licensing and tax regimes while releasing warnings against crypto scams in the region. The agency released a set of crypto scams in New Zealand while suggesting some tips for investments to avoid such situations. One of the biggest crypto risks in New Zealand, according to the FMA, is the inability to find out the entity offering services. FMA said that due to big overseas crypto exchanges, it is hard to find out who is offering, buying, selling, or exchanging crypto, putting the assets at risk of theft. It stated– “Because it is decentralised by nature, there’s no control by a single entity such as a government, bank, or financial institution – there are no restrictions on who can issue them.” Crypto License in New Zealand 2025 Licensing: While there are no specific crypto licenses in New Zealand , crypto asset service providers (CASPs) and wallet service providers must register with the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) as financial service providers (FSPs) to obtain a crypto license to continue operations. Compliance: CASPs, wallet service providers, and businesses involved with crypto must comply with anti-money laundering (AML), counter-terrorism financing (CFT), and the know-your-customer (KYC) obligations. Reporting: Entities providing digital asset services may be required to report their transaction and other information to FMC, especially if any suspicious activity is discovered. Crypto Tax in New Zealand 2025 Capital Gains Tax (CGT): CGT does not apply to crypto in New Zealand, as it considers crypto as property. Income Tax: Earning and disposing of crypto is subject to general income tax in New Zealand. The key advisor on government tax policies in New Zealand, the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), said in a statement – “If you acquire crypto assets to dispose of them, you need to pay income tax on any profit you make.

2025-07-19 05:40:15+00:00,Bitcoin ETFs Witness Explosive $363.57M Inflows: A New Era for Cryptocurrency Investment,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin ETFs Witness Explosive $363.57M Inflows: A New Era for Cryptocurrency Investment The world of digital assets is buzzing with excitement as U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to defy expectations, marking an impressive streak of positive flows. On July 18, these groundbreaking investment vehicles recorded a staggering $363.57 million in net inflows, extending their winning streak to twelve consecutive trading days. This consistent influx of capital into US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is not just a number; it’s a powerful signal of growing investor confidence and the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. For those closely watching the cryptocurrency space, these sustained Bitcoin ETF Inflows represent a pivotal moment. They signify a maturing market where traditional finance is not just observing, but actively participating, channeling significant capital into the digital realm. This article will delve into the details of these recent flows, explore the driving forces behind this phenomenon, and discuss what it means for the future of Cryptocurrency Investment . What’s Driving the Phenomenal Rise in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs? The journey of US Spot Bitcoin ETFs began with much anticipation and, initially, some volatility following their launch in January. However, after an initial period of adjustments, these ETFs have demonstrated remarkable resilience and an undeniable appeal to a wide range of investors. The recent twelve-day streak of net inflows highlights a fundamental shift in market sentiment and investment behavior. One of the primary drivers behind this sustained interest is the accessibility and regulatory clarity that ETFs offer. Unlike direct Bitcoin purchases, which can be daunting for traditional investors due to concerns about security, custody, and regulatory uncertainty, spot Bitcoin ETFs provide a familiar, regulated wrapper. Investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through their existing brokerage accounts, simplifying the process immensely. Leading the charge in these inflows is BlackRock’s IBIT, which on July 18 alone saw an astounding $496.88 million in inflows. BlackRock, a titan in the asset management industry, brings unparalleled brand trust and distribution networks. Their aggressive marketing and robust infrastructure have clearly resonated with both retail and institutional clients, making IBIT a dominant force in the nascent spot Bitcoin ETF market. This strong performance by major players like BlackRock is a clear indicator of the burgeoning interest in institutional crypto adoption . Diving Deep into the Latest Bitcoin ETF Inflows Data Let’s break down the figures from July 18 to understand the nuances of these significant Bitcoin ETF Inflows . While the overall picture is overwhelmingly positive, a closer look reveals interesting dynamics among the various funds. U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Net Inflows (July 18): Total Net Inflows: $363.57 million Consecutive Positive Flow Days: 12 Individual ETF Performance: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Flow (July 18) IBIT BlackRock +$496.88 million BTCW WisdomTree +$3.11 million GBTC Grayscale -$81.29 million ARKB Ark Invest -$33.61 million FBTC Fidelity -$17.94 million BITB Bitwise -$1.92 million HODL VanEck -$1.66 million (Data shared by Trader T on X) As the table clearly illustrates, BlackRock’s IBIT is the undeniable leader, capturing the lion’s share of new money. This indicates strong confidence in BlackRock’s offering and its ability to attract substantial capital. WisdomTree’s BTCW also recorded a modest positive inflow, contributing to the overall net positive figure. On the flip side, Grayscale’s GBTC continued to experience net outflows. This trend is not new and is largely attributed to its conversion from a trust to an ETF. Many investors who held GBTC at a discount before its conversion are now taking profits or rotating into other, often lower-fee, spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT or FBTC. Similarly, other prominent ETFs like Ark Invest’s ARKB, Fidelity’s FBTC, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL also saw modest outflows on this particular day. Despite these individual outflows, the overwhelming positive inflows into IBIT ensure the overall market remains in a strong accumulation phase for Bitcoin. The Broader Impact: Reshaping Cryptocurrency Investment Landscape The consistent positive flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs are more than just financial metrics; they are reshaping the entire landscape of Cryptocurrency Investment . For years, Bitcoin was largely considered a niche asset, primarily traded by tech-savvy individuals or early adopters.

2025-07-19 06:10:18+00:00,Bitcoin’s Epic July: Unlocking the Path to a New All-Time High,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Epic July: Unlocking the Path to a New All-Time High Are you on the edge of your seat, watching every flicker of the Bitcoin chart? The crypto world is buzzing with anticipation, and for good reason. Recent insights from industry leaders suggest that while Bitcoin (BTC) might be gearing up for a brief period of Bitcoin consolidation , the dream of a new all-time high before the end of July is very much alive. This isn’t just wishful thinking; it’s a sentiment backed by strong market indicators and expert analysis, promising an exciting phase for the premier cryptocurrency. For anyone invested in or observing the digital asset space, understanding these dynamics is absolutely crucial. The Current State of Bitcoin Consolidation: What Does it Mean? When we talk about Bitcoin consolidation , we’re referring to a period where the price movement becomes relatively flat, often trading within a defined range. It’s a phase where the market takes a breather after a significant price move, allowing for accumulation or distribution without a clear directional trend. Michael Harvey, head of franchise trading at Galaxy Digital, highlighted this potential brief consolidation phase for Bitcoin. But why is consolidation considered a healthy sign in a volatile market like crypto? Building a Strong Base: Consolidation allows the market to digest previous gains, attracting new buyers at current price levels and shaking out weak hands or short-term traders. Gathering Momentum: Think of it like a coiled spring. The longer Bitcoin consolidates, the more energy it builds for its next significant move. Market Re-evaluation: It provides an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate their positions and for the market to establish new support and resistance levels. This period of sideways movement, though seemingly uneventful, is a vital part of a sustainable bull run. It prevents the market from overheating and sets the stage for future appreciation. While some might view it as stagnation, experienced traders often see consolidation as a precursor to significant upward momentum. A 5-10% pullback, as warned by Harvey, would fit perfectly into this consolidation narrative, offering fresh entry points for those who missed previous rallies. Is a BTC All-Time High by July Really Possible? The prospect of a new BTC all-time high by the end of July is an electrifying thought for many, especially after the impressive rallies Bitcoin has already seen. Michael Harvey’s optimistic outlook is not without foundational support. Several powerful forces are converging that could propel Bitcoin past its previous peak and into uncharted territory. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s an analysis rooted in observable market behavior and fundamental shifts within the crypto ecosystem. The factors underpinning this optimistic Bitcoin price prediction are multi-faceted and reflect a maturing market: Strong Inflows into U.S. Spot BTC ETFs: The approval and subsequent launch of these exchange-traded funds have revolutionized institutional access to Bitcoin. These ETFs act as a direct pipeline for traditional finance capital to flow into Bitcoin, absorbing significant amounts of supply from the market. Unlike individual investors, institutions often deploy large sums, and their consistent buying pressure can dramatically impact price discovery. Continued Accumulation by Treasury-Focused Firms: Beyond ETFs, various corporations and public companies are increasingly adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets as a treasury reserve asset. This signifies a long-term, conviction-based holding strategy, reducing the circulating supply and indicating growing corporate confidence in Bitcoin’s value proposition as a hedge against inflation or a store of value. These are not short-term traders; they are strategic holders. Growing Retail Interest: While institutional adoption lays the groundwork, it’s often renewed retail interest that provides the explosive fuel for a parabolic rally. As Bitcoin gains mainstream media attention and its price continues to climb, fear of missing out (FOMO) draws in new individual investors, increasing demand across various platforms and exchanges. This broad-based participation creates powerful buying pressure that can rapidly accelerate price movements. These three pillars—institutional investment, corporate adoption, and renewed retail enthusiasm—create a powerful demand-side dynamic that, if sustained, could very realistically push Bitcoin to a new all-time high within the predicted timeframe. The confluence of these factors paints a compelling picture for Bitcoin’s near-term future.

2025-07-19 07:00:30+00:00,WisdomTree Report Reveals How Much XRP Must Climb to Surpass Bitcoin,"A recent report from WisdomTree compared the technical capabilities of XRP and Bitcoin, offering a perspective on how XRP could potentially challenge Bitcoin’s dominance. The document emphasized XRP’s significant edge in transaction speed. It compares XRP’s throughput of 1,500 transactions per second to Bitcoin’s 7 transactions per second. XRP is significantly more efficient than Bitcoin, and the document says it consistently outperformed Bitcoin in transaction volume per second over several years. It also made it clear that XRP’s efficiency positions it as a strong candidate for real-time payments, while Bitcoin’s slower pace reflects a focus on decentralization and security. The 20x Price Challenge Toward the end of the document, WisdomTree laid out a stark comparison: “To match bitcoin’s market capitalisation, XRP’s price would need to increase more than 20x from its current levels.” At the time the report was prepared, Bitcoin’s market cap was $1.9 trillion. SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a well-known crypto researcher, brought renewed attention to this analysis in a recent post, pointing to WisdomTree’s statement as documentation of XRP’s potential. Remember, XRP only has to 20x from current price levels to surpass Bitcoin. Documented by WisdomTree. https://t.co/KttXOWzP13 pic.twitter.com/yoIKPQs02E — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 17, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is a 20x Surge Enough to Flip Bitcoin With XRP currently priced at $3.59 and its market cap sitting at $212.27 billion, a 20x increase would put its price at $71.80. Multiplying that by the current circulating supply (approximately 59.13 billion XRP), the projected market cap would reach roughly $4.24 trillion. By comparison, Bitcoin is now trading at $120,423, with a total market cap of $2.39 trillion. This means that if XRP were to 20x from current levels, its market cap would not only surpass Bitcoin’s, but it would do so by a significant margin of nearly $1.85 trillion. Experts have predicted for years that XRP could surpass Bitcoin , and this calculation reveals that, at least in theory, the 20x growth model referenced by WisdomTree now exceeds what is required to overtake Bitcoin. Outlook for XRP’s Trajectory The WisdomTree report made clear that for XRP to reach this level realistically, four major developments are essential. These include mass adoption, regulatory clarity, ecosystem expansion, and favorable market sentiment. These conditions remain as critical now as they were when the report was first issued. While the goal is daunting, especially considering Bitcoin’s deep-rooted dominance, current price levels suggest that a 20x rise in XRP would be more than sufficient to claim the top spot. XRP is already on its way to a new all-time high , and many market participants are confident that it will surpass Bitcoin in this cycle.

A recent report from WisdomTree compared the technical capabilities of XRP and Bitcoin, offering a perspective on how XRP could potentially challenge Bitcoin’s dominance. The document emphasized XRP’s significant edge in transaction speed. It compares XRP’s throughput of 1,500 transactions per second to Bitcoin’s 7 transactions per second. XRP is significantly more efficient than Bitcoin, and the document says it consistently outperformed Bitcoin in transaction volume per second over several years. It also made it clear that XRP’s efficiency positions it as a strong candidate for real-time payments, while Bitcoin’s slower pace reflects a focus on decentralization and security. The 20x Price Challenge Toward the end of the document, WisdomTree laid out a stark comparison: “To match bitcoin’s market capitalisation, XRP’s price would need to increase more than 20x from its current levels.” At the time the report was prepared, Bitcoin’s market cap was $1.9 trillion. SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG), a well-known crypto researcher, brought renewed attention to this analysis in a recent post, pointing to WisdomTree’s statement as documentation of XRP’s potential. Remember, XRP only has to 20x from current price levels to surpass Bitcoin. Documented by WisdomTree. https://t.co/KttXOWzP13 pic.twitter.com/yoIKPQs02E — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 17, 2025 We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is a 20x Surge Enough to Flip Bitcoin With XRP currently priced at $3.59 and its market cap sitting at $212.27 billion, a 20x increase would put its price at $71.80. Multiplying that by the current circulating supply (approximately 59.13 billion XRP), the projected market cap would reach roughly $4.24 trillion. By comparison, Bitcoin is now trading at $120,423, with a total market cap of $2.39 trillion. This means that if XRP were to 20x from current levels, its market cap would not only surpass Bitcoin’s, but it would do so by a significant margin of nearly $1.85 trillion. Experts have predicted for years that XRP could surpass Bitcoin , and this calculation reveals that, at least in theory, the 20x growth model referenced by WisdomTree now exceeds what is required to overtake Bitcoin. Outlook for XRP’s Trajectory The WisdomTree report made clear that for XRP to reach this level realistically, four major developments are essential. These include mass adoption, regulatory clarity, ecosystem expansion, and favorable market sentiment. These conditions remain as critical now as they were when the report was first issued. While the goal is daunting, especially considering Bitcoin’s deep-rooted dominance, current price levels suggest that a 20x rise in XRP would be more than sufficient to claim the top spot. XRP is already on its way to a new all-time high , and many market participants are confident that it will surpass Bitcoin in this cycle.

In their Q2 2025 earnings reports, the three major banks disclosed billions of dollars in losses from “net charge-offs” — loans written off as uncollectible after all efforts to recover payments proved unsuccessful. Among the trio, JPMorgan Chase reported the highest level of charge-offs at $2.4 billion, predominantly driven by bad credit card debt. Meanwhile, Citi wiped $2.234 billion in bad loans off its books, including $1.889 billion tied to its retail credit card portfolio. And Wells Fargo recorded $977 million in net charge-offs, fueled by $818 million in sour loans from its consumer banking and lending segment. The figures come as fresh data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that US credit card balances reached $1.18 trillion by the end of March 2025. Despite the losses, Citi reported a $225 million decline in net credit losses quarter-over-quarter, and Wells Fargo saw a $12 million decrease in net charge-offs over the same period. However, JPMorgan witnessed an increase of at $179 million in net charge-offs over the three-month period.

The cryptocurrency is now consolidating near $118,000, and according to Galaxy Digital’s Michael Harvey, this could be a “pause for air” before another potential leg up by the end of July. Will Bitcoin Price Hit a New All-Time High Before July Ends? Michael Harvey , head of franchise trading at Galaxy Digital, believes Bitcoin could still hit a new all-time high before the month ends, but only if several bullish conditions align. He describes the most optimistic path as a “slow melt-up,” powered by continuous inflows into U.S.-based spot Bitcoin ETFs , ongoing accumulation by Bitcoin treasury firms, and a noticeable increase in retail investor interest. ETF flows have been strong, and institutional accumulation remains consistent, supporting the bullish outlook. However, retail activity, typically a key driver of Bitcoin blow-off tops, is still uncertain. While Coinbase has climbed to #137 on the Apple App Store, indicating rising curiosity among retail users, Google Trends data shows that searches for “Bitcoin” remain relatively low. Could Bitcoin Price Drop to $110K Before the Next Rally? Harvey also outlined a cautious view. A pullback triggered by profit-taking or broader equity market weakness could drag Bitcoin down 5–10%, putting $110,000 at risk. Such a correction wouldn’t necessarily end the bull market, but it would signal temporary weakness and a break in momentum. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Prediction: How High Can ETH Really Go by 2026? , Will the Bitcoin Bull Run Peak in October 2025?

Casa CTO Jameson Lopp and five developers have proposed a new defensive shield for the BTC network to counter this threat. The new Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), presented in San Francisco, aims to create a post-quantum address security system. Its most notable proposal: freezing the approximately 1 million Bitcoins believed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto, which have been dormant for years. Experts say that with the development of quantum computers, methods like Shor''s algorithm could reverse-engineer private keys once sufficient processing power is available. According to Deloitte research, approximately a quarter of Bitcoins are vulnerable to quantum attacks. If this happens within the next 10 years, a massive market crash could occur, including the loss of millions of BTC held by Satoshi Nakamoto. Related News: White House Cryptocurrency Executive Bo Hines Announced: “Trump Will Sign The Decision That Will Change The Fate Of Cryptocurrencies Today” The BIP proposal presented by Lopp and his team includes a three-phase security plan: Blocking new funds from entering addresses vulnerable to quantum. Automatic freezing of old coins that have not been moved for five years. The ability to selectively unlock these assets with quantum-resistant signatures. BTC holdings in Satoshi Nakamoto''s known wallets. However, Lopp''s proposal isn''t the only solution. Anduro protocol engineer Hunter Beast has previously proposed a post-quantum address design with BIP 360, offering varying levels of security. Such solutions typically strike different balances between technical factors such as algorithm selection, key length, and transaction throughput. Like every BIP, this proposal must undergo intense debate and technical testing before implementation. Lopp argues that a successful quantum attack could cause massive economic disruption and that the Bitcoin community must unite and act quickly. However, post-quantum signatures come with much larger file sizes. This can increase transaction data and increase block space consumption.

2025-07-19 07:25:18+00:00,Crypto Liquidation: Shocking $270M+ Wiped Out in 24 Hours,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidation: Shocking $270M+ Wiped Out in 24 Hours The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, often characterized by rapid price swings and intense trading activity. For many traders, the allure of amplified gains draws them to derivatives like perpetual futures. However, this high-stakes environment also comes with significant risks, none more dramatic than crypto liquidation . Over the past 24 hours, the market witnessed a staggering amount of capital wiped out, highlighting the inherent volatility and the critical importance of risk management in perpetual futures trading. Let’s dive deep into the recent breakdown and understand what these massive liquidations mean for the broader crypto landscape. What Exactly Are Perpetual Futures in Crypto Trading? Before we dissect the recent numbers, it’s crucial to grasp the concept of perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have a fixed expiration date, perpetual futures in crypto never expire. They are designed to mimic the spot market price of an asset while allowing traders to use leverage, meaning they can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. This innovative instrument has become incredibly popular due to its flexibility and the potential for magnified profits. No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. Leverage: Allows traders to open positions much larger than their initial capital, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Funding Rates: A mechanism unique to perpetual futures that ensures the contract price stays tethered to the spot price. Traders pay or receive small fees based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price. Understanding Crypto Liquidation: The Sudden Wipeout So, what happens when a trader’s leveraged position goes awry? That’s where crypto liquidation comes into play. In simple terms, liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. This typically happens when the market moves strongly against their leveraged position. To prevent further losses for the exchange and the trader, the position is automatically closed by the exchange. Margin Call: Before full liquidation, some exchanges might issue a “margin call,” prompting traders to add more funds to their account. Automatic Closure: If the trader fails to add more margin or the price continues to move unfavorably, the position is automatically closed at the market price. Loss of Collateral: The trader loses their initial margin and any additional collateral they might have put up. This can lead to significant, often total, loss of the invested capital for that specific trade. The Past 24 Hours: A Staggering Crypto Liquidation Breakdown The last 24 hours painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant crypto liquidation events across major assets. Here’s a breakdown of the reported figures: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (24h) Long Liquidations (%) Ethereum (ETH) $151.00 million 75.91% Bitcoin (BTC) $76.46 million 87.91% Ripple (XRP) $42.18 million 81.22% The total liquidations across these three assets alone exceeded $270 million , with a dominant majority being “long” positions. This indicates that a sharp downward price movement caught many traders off guard, forcing their bullish bets to be closed out. ETH: The Largest Hit in Crypto Liquidation Ethereum led the pack with an astonishing $151 million in liquidations. With nearly 76% of these being long positions, it suggests that many traders were highly leveraged, betting on ETH’s price to continue its upward trajectory. A sudden dip in ETH’s price likely triggered a cascade of liquidations, as positions were automatically closed, adding selling pressure to the market. BTC: Bitcoin’s Volatile Ride and its Impact on Crypto Liquidation Bitcoin, the market leader, saw $76.46 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of long positions at almost 88%. This underscores Bitcoin’s continued influence on the broader market; often, when BTC dips, altcoins follow. Traders anticipating a continued bull run for BTC found themselves in a precarious situation as prices corrected. XRP: A Ripple Effect of Crypto Liquidation XRP experienced $42.18 million in liquidations, with over 81% being long positions. While smaller in absolute terms compared to ETH and BTC, this still represents a significant amount for XRP traders. It highlights that even assets with specific legal or fundamental news can be susceptible to broader market movements and the perils of high leverage. Why Such Massive Crypto Liquidations? Unpacking the Triggers Several interconnected factors contribute to large-scale crypto liquidation events: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile.

Before we dissect the recent numbers, it’s crucial to grasp the concept of perpetual futures. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have a fixed expiration date, perpetual futures in crypto never expire. They are designed to mimic the spot market price of an asset while allowing traders to use leverage, meaning they can control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. This innovative instrument has become incredibly popular due to its flexibility and the potential for magnified profits. No Expiry Date: Traders can hold positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. Leverage: Allows traders to open positions much larger than their initial capital, amplifying both potential gains and losses. Funding Rates: A mechanism unique to perpetual futures that ensures the contract price stays tethered to the spot price. Traders pay or receive small fees based on the difference between the perpetual contract price and the spot price. Understanding Crypto Liquidation: The Sudden Wipeout So, what happens when a trader’s leveraged position goes awry? That’s where crypto liquidation comes into play. In simple terms, liquidation occurs when a trader’s margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement. This typically happens when the market moves strongly against their leveraged position. To prevent further losses for the exchange and the trader, the position is automatically closed by the exchange. Margin Call: Before full liquidation, some exchanges might issue a “margin call,” prompting traders to add more funds to their account. Automatic Closure: If the trader fails to add more margin or the price continues to move unfavorably, the position is automatically closed at the market price. Loss of Collateral: The trader loses their initial margin and any additional collateral they might have put up. This can lead to significant, often total, loss of the invested capital for that specific trade. The Past 24 Hours: A Staggering Crypto Liquidation Breakdown The last 24 hours painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant crypto liquidation events across major assets. Here’s a breakdown of the reported figures: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (24h) Long Liquidations (%) Ethereum (ETH) $151.00 million 75.91% Bitcoin (BTC) $76.46 million 87.91% Ripple (XRP) $42.18 million 81.22% The total liquidations across these three assets alone exceeded $270 million , with a dominant majority being “long” positions. This indicates that a sharp downward price movement caught many traders off guard, forcing their bullish bets to be closed out. ETH: The Largest Hit in Crypto Liquidation Ethereum led the pack with an astonishing $151 million in liquidations. With nearly 76% of these being long positions, it suggests that many traders were highly leveraged, betting on ETH’s price to continue its upward trajectory. A sudden dip in ETH’s price likely triggered a cascade of liquidations, as positions were automatically closed, adding selling pressure to the market. BTC: Bitcoin’s Volatile Ride and its Impact on Crypto Liquidation Bitcoin, the market leader, saw $76.46 million in liquidations, with an even higher percentage of long positions at almost 88%. This underscores Bitcoin’s continued influence on the broader market; often, when BTC dips, altcoins follow. Traders anticipating a continued bull run for BTC found themselves in a precarious situation as prices corrected. XRP: A Ripple Effect of Crypto Liquidation XRP experienced $42.18 million in liquidations, with over 81% being long positions. While smaller in absolute terms compared to ETH and BTC, this still represents a significant amount for XRP traders. It highlights that even assets with specific legal or fundamental news can be susceptible to broader market movements and the perils of high leverage. Why Such Massive Crypto Liquidations? Unpacking the Triggers Several interconnected factors contribute to large-scale crypto liquidation events: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile. Sharp, unpredictable price movements, often triggered by macro-economic news, regulatory announcements, or large whale movements, can quickly push le"

The move earned praise from Bitcoin maximalists worldwide and positioned the nation as a testbed for large-scale crypto adoption. But as of mid-2025, that bold vision appears to be fading—and fast. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy On November 16, 2022, Bukele announced El Salvador would begin buying 1 Bitcoin per day. Around the same time, the country set up a National Bitcoin Office to coordinate crypto initiatives. These developments, along with BTC’s legal status, signaled the government’s deep commitment to Bitcoin adoption. Bukele’s policies—pro-crypto and anti-establishment—resonated with many Salvadorans, helping him secure a historic re-election in February 2024. IMF Bailout Exposes BTC Slowdown Despite its revolutionary image, El Salvador’s economy struggled under mounting debt and inflation. To stabilize finances, the government turned to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which approved a $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility in February 2025 . However, the IMF made one thing clear: El Salvador must limit public-sector Bitcoin activity, including BTC purchases and transactions. The government publicly pushed back, stating it would continue buying Bitcoin—claims echoed across official social media. But a July 15, 2025 IMF report told a different story. El Salvador Hasn’t Bought Bitcoin Since December 2024 According to the IMF, El Salvador hasn’t purchased any new Bitcoin since December 2024—the same month IMF talks concluded. The report clarified that recent wallet activity was merely internal transfers, not fresh acquisitions. Even more telling, Bitcoin quietly lost its legal tender status in January 2025, signaling a strategic backpedal. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Price Could Hit New Highs by July-End, Says Galaxy Digital , What’s Next?

Over the past year, XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by an impressive 277% , climbing to a new all-time high of $3.66 before easing slightly to around $3.45. But according to popular crypto trader EGRAG CRYPTO , the real story isn’t just the price, it’s XRP’s growing dominance, which he says is pointing to a “mega bullish wave.” Bullish Pennant and the Kaboom Setup According to EGRAG, XRP’s dominance chart has just broken out of a bullish pennant, a classic technical pattern that often precedes large upward moves. He predicts this breakout could trigger gains of 21% to 275%, which would be one of the biggest rallies XRP has ever seen. What’s adding to the excitement is that the key factor driving this prediction is the Visible Range Volume Profile (VRVP) indicator. EGRAG notes that there’s a “void” zone above 5.75% dominance. If XRP crosses and holds above this level, it could spark what he calls the Kaboom phase, a period of explosive growth in XRP’s dominance. Fibonacci Levels Backing the Surge EGRAG also shared his XRP Fab chart, which maps XRP’s potential market cap against global crypto capitalization using Fibonacci levels. For instance, at a $10 trillion crypto market cap, XRP’s market cap could soar beyond $2 trillion if it hits the 0.888 Fibonacci level. Even a conservative target could place XRP’s market cap between $800 billion and $1.5 trillion, levels never seen before for the token. XRP Price Analysis As of now, XRP price is trading near $3.44 after hitting a new high of $3.66, showing strong demand from both traders and big investors. Meanwhile, a Golden Cross (50‑day EMA moving above the 100‑day EMA) confirms bullish momentum, while the MACD buy signal that started on June 28 is still active, keeping risk appetite alive.

One researcher, known online as “Ripple Van Winkle,” recently expressed confidence that XRP could rise significantly if Bitcoin climbs to the $140,000 level. Van Winkle proposed that under such circumstances, XRP would not merely reach moderate price targets. Instead, he believes the token could exceed the $10 threshold and potentially climb to $14. This prediction aligns with broader market expectations that a shift in investor capital from Bitcoin to altcoins could create upward pressure on high-profile tokens such as XRP. Veteran Traders Also Back XRP’s Upside Van Winkle’s projection echoes recent comments made by market veteran ProfitMana, who included XRP among his top investment picks for the ongoing bull cycle. According to Mana, XRP has the potential to deliver returns between five and seven times its current value. He also suggested that the token’s price could peak at around $21 during this market cycle. If BTC tags $140K, XRP doesn’t just go to $7. It blows through $10 — maybe even $14. The XRP/BTC pair is the ultimate alpha signal. Rotation is coming. Be early or be exit liquidity. $XRP — Ripple Van Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) July 17, 2025 These forecasts come at a time when Bitcoin, which briefly touched $120,000 earlier in the day, is now trading slightly lower at $117,400 . Its market dominance has declined by approximately 4.6% over the past week, signaling a potential redistribution of capital toward altcoins. During the same period, XRP has gained traction, with its market dominance increasing by 26%, reflecting renewed interest from investors. At a hypothetical price of $14, XRP’s market capitalization would stand near $825 billion. This would place the token in close competition with Ethereum in terms of total market value, significantly raising its profile in the crypto sector. XRP/BTC Pair as a Key Indicator A central element in Van Winkle’s forecast is the XRP/BTC trading pair, which he referred to as an essential metric for evaluating XRP’s breakout potential. Although he did not offer an in-depth analysis, other experts have provided technical context for this pairing. Earlier this month, analyst CrediBULL observed that the pair had approached a critical resistance level of 0.00002162 BTC for the fifth time in one month, after being rejected four times previously. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This resistance zone is aligned with a key Fibonacci retracement level, making it a strong technical barrier. A breakout above this level, which did occur, paved the way for further gains. As of the latest data, the pair is trading at 0.00003051 BTC. If the breakout holds, it may serve as further confirmation of the altcoin rally narrative. Historically, such breakouts in the XRP/BTC pair have been followed by sustained upward movements in XRP’s value, particularly during periods of waning Bitcoin dominance. Market Timing and Strategic Positioning Van Winkle emphasized the importance of early positioning for investors looking to benefit from a potential XRP rally. He advised market participants not to delay entry, cautioning that waiting too long could lead to missed opportunities or disadvantageous entry points. His message was clear: those who wait for broader market consensus might find themselves entering at the top, with limited room for gains. This view was also shared by software developer Vincent Van Code, who stated that the opportunity to buy XRP at ideal levels may already be gone. With Bitcoin showing signs of maturity in its current cycle and altcoins gaining momentum, many analysts believe the conditions are in place for a major shift in market leadership.

However, a glimmer of hope emerged in Q2 as the price attempted to rise from April onwards. Unfortunately, momentum faltered after reaching $1.62, and from the third week of May to the third week of June, the price fell to $0.79. Yet, the last week of June brought a positive shift, with improved geopolitical conditions helping the price surge to the $1.15 mark by the third week of July.

The altcoins, which were flying high yesterday, have seen even bigger price declines over the past 24 hours, with SUI leading the adverse trend. BTC Stopped at $120K Bitcoin had a spectacular start to the business week as its ascent that began last week culminated on Monday with a price surge to just over $123,000 . Thus, the cryptocurrency set a new all-time high after adding over $15,000 in the span of about five days. This ‘up only’ mode finally came to an end, and the asset went on an expected correction. It lost over seven grand in the following day or so, driven mainly by profit-taking and some uncertainty in the US after the worrying CPI data for June. Nevertheless, the bulls didn’t allow a further breakdown, and BTC started to recover the lost ground. By the end of the week, it challenged $120,000 and even went for $121,000 on a few occasions, but to no avail. The subsequent rejections pushed it south hard, and BTC slipped to $117,000 yesterday. It has recovered some ground and now trades around $118,000, but it’s still in the red on a daily scale. Its market cap has declined to $2.350 trillion, while its dominance over the alts is below 60%. BTCUSD.

2025-07-19 08:30:06+00:00,Ethereum Futures Flip Bitcoin: Volume 50% Higher Than BTC’s,"Data shows the Ethereum futures volume has flipped that of Bitcoin, a sign that strong speculative interest is flooding into the asset. Ethereum Futures Volume Has Shot Up Alongside Price Rally According to data from the analytics firm Glassnode , Ethereum has managed to surpass Bitcoin in terms of futures trading volume again. The trading volume here naturally refers to the amount of trading that a given asset saw on the different centralized exchanges during the past day. In the context of the current topic, the volume associated with the futures market specifically is of interest. Below is a table that shows how this metric compared between Bitcoin and Ethereum at the time of Glassnode’s post. As is visible, Bitcoin registered a futures trading volume of $67.5 billion, notably lower than the $104.2 billion figure witnessed by Ethereum. This isn’t something that ordinarily happens, as the number one cryptocurrency usually observes more speculative demand than ETH or the altcoins. In the same table, data of a few other futures-related indicators is also shown. The BTC Open Interest , a metric that keeps track of the total amount of futures positions currently open on all derivatives platforms, sat at $64.2 billion at the time of the post. The same indicator for ETH was at $32.2 billion, indicating that the original digital asset was still far ahead in terms of total market positioning. That said, the 24-hour change in the metric stood at a positive 6.1% for Ethereum, while Bitcoin saw a drop of 1.4% The fresh demand for ETH has come as its price has broken away from the market, accompanied by a strong wave of inflows into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . Interestingly, while all this attention came toward the cryptocurrency, its average Funding Rate still didn’t turn too positive. The Funding Rate is an indicator that keeps track of the amount of periodic fees that traders on the futures market are exchanging between each other. When this metric is green, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies the presence of a bullish mentality among the traders. From the table, it’s apparent that the Funding Rate stood at 0.0096% for Ethereum even after the spike in futures trading volume. This was less than Bitcoin’s value of 0.01%. Thus, while fresh positioning is occurring for ETH, it seems the investors are still not getting too optimistic. “This setup leans bullish: strong speculative interest, rising OI, and no signs of overheating yet,” notes the analytics firm. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,600, up almost 21% in the last week.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-futures-bitcoin-volume-50-higher-btcs/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK,Ethereum|bitcoin|Bitcoin Futures Volume|btc|ETH|Ethereum futures|Ethereum Futures Volume|ETHUSDT,BTC,"Ethereum Futures Flip Bitcoin: Volume 50% Higher Than BTC’s.

When this metric is green, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies the presence of a bullish mentality among the traders. From the table, it’s apparent that the Funding Rate stood at 0.0096% for Ethereum even after the spike in futures trading volume. This was less than Bitcoin’s value of 0.01%. Thus, while fresh positioning is occurring for ETH, it seems the investors are still not getting too optimistic. “This setup leans bullish: strong speculative interest, rising OI, and no signs of overheating yet,” notes the analytics firm. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $3,600, up almost 21% in the last week."
2025-07-19 08:30:06+00:00,"Satoshi-Era Bitcoin Now For Sale: Galaxy Digital Sends 1,500 BTC To Binance","Bitcoin is currently consolidating between $115,000 and its all-time high of $123,000, forming a tight range that has kept both bulls and bears on edge. Despite the recent surge, price action has slowed, and while bulls are holding strong above key levels, market participants are growing cautious about the potential for a correction.

Top analyst Darkfost has been tracking this long-dormant wallet, which recently transferred 80,000 BTC to Galaxy Digital, a major player in digital assets and AI infrastructure. The move immediately triggered speculation across the crypto space, as such large transfers are often associated with upcoming sales. The timing of this transfer is crucial. It coincides with increased exchange inflows and rising discussions of institutional profit-taking. With the market already in a delicate position, the possibility that a portion of this massive BTC stack could be sold has analysts and investors bracing for elevated volatility. Whale Starts Selling: 1,500 BTC Sent To Binance Darkfost has confirmed that Galaxy Digital has just moved 1,500 BTC to a Binance deposit address. These coins were previously part of the massive 80,000 BTC linked to a Satoshi-era whale who recently reactivated their wallet. The latest transfer suggests that a portion of this historic stash is officially up for sale. At current prices, the 1,500 BTC represents around $180 million in market value. More importantly, it marks one of the fastest and most significant offloads ever recorded from a single wallet, with the total 80K BTC valued at roughly $9.54 billion. While they have only moved a small fraction to exchanges so far, the sale could signal larger intentions. Some view this transfer as a potential warning sign, especially given the current consolidation above $115K. In their view, such high-volume activity from a long-term holder might precede further profit-taking or even a broader correction. Others, however, see it as a smart and well-timed move from an investor who has held since Bitcoin’s earliest days and is finally realizing some gains.

This comes after a strong breakout earlier this month that pushed BTC to a new all-time high of $123,230.

In a new interview with CNBC Television, Mericle says he expects the Fed to make three rate cuts this year, starting in two months, as he predicts tariff-driven inflation will be transitory. “I think the latest batch of data suggests that the stakes are not hugely high at the moment, that the economy, the labor market at least, doesn’t seem to be in need of great rate cuts. But the inflation data, from my perspective, suggests that we’re doing just fine, and that the underlying trend is moving back towards something closer to 2% – even if tariff effects are and are likely to continue to give us a little bit of a boost on top of that. We still have three cuts penciled in for later this year. I think they could start in September, because I’m relaxed about the inflation news. I think we are moving in the right direction for reasons many economists anticipated; supply and demand, especially in the labor market, are back in balance. We’re seeing the end of catch-up inflation, and I’m not worried about tariffs unanchoring inflation expectations, but I do think you are seeing those effects show up from month to month.” Mericle also says that one reason why tariff impacts will be short-lived is that the economic conditions, particularly in the labor market, are much different from what they were about three years ago when inflation soared. “The actual boost to inflation, especially against a backdrop where the economy is not nearly facing the same degree of labor market tightness as it did back when we all worried about this in 2022, probably means that the tariff effects are not going to spark a long, prolonged period of high inflation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The analytics platform says that, based on the short-term holder (STH) cost basis model, the next major resistance level for the crypto king stands below $140,000. The STH cost basis model is an on-chain metric that estimates the average price at which short-term Bitcoin holders acquired their coins. The metric can be used to spot potential entry and exit points. “Assuming current momentum remains strong, the next key resistance lies at the +2 standard deviation band, which is currently trading around $136,000.” Source: Glassnode Glassnode, however, says that while there’s potential for another leg higher for Bitcoin, the flagship crypto asset could form a near-term top as short-term holders are sitting on significant unrealized profits. “Bitcoin has broken to new [all-time highs] ATHs, and has cleared above two major accumulation zones. This represents a significant market move, which tends to be followed by strong positive momentum. However, short-term holders, being the more price-sensitive cohort, are now seeing their unrealized profit reaching marginally overheated levels, making the incentive for them to sell and take profit increasingly likely.” According to Glassnode, the percentage of short-term holder supply of Bitcoin in profit is currently at 95%, seven percentage points above the long-term mean of 88%. “If this metric begins to stabilize or decline below the 88% level, it could be an early signal of weakening demand or distribution taking hold.” Source: Glassnode Bitcoin is trading at $117,810 at time of writing.

2025-07-19 09:22:31+00:00,"Bitcoin at ATH, XRP at $3—But Next-Gen Presale XYZVerse Could Crack the $1 Billion Market Cap","The cryptocurrency market is witnessing unprecedented milestones as leading coins reach remarkable levels. Amidst Bitcoin''s surge and XRP''s impressive performance, a new contender emerges. The presale of XYZVerse is capturing attention with the potential to attain a $1 billion market cap. Enthusiasts and investors are eager to explore what this next-generation platform brings to the table. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution.

Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Bitcoin Unveiled: How Digital Currency is Changing Finance Bitcoin is the first and most famous cryptocurrency. It was created by someone named Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin allows people to send money directly to each other without using a bank. Instead of physical coins, it exists as a record on a shared system called the blockchain. This means everyone can see all the transactions, making it transparent. To make sure transactions are real, people called miners solve difficult puzzles to confirm them. When they do, they earn new bitcoins as a reward. This process helps keep the system safe from fraud. Bitcoin has a lot of potential to change how we use money. By removing the need for banks, it can make transactions faster and cheaper. The number of bitcoins is limited to 21 million, which can make it valuable like gold. Every four years, the rewards for miners are cut in half, a process known as ""halving."" This can affect how profitable it is to mine bitcoins and can influence the market. Right now, many people are interested in Bitcoin because of its unique features and potential for growth. Compared to other coins, Bitcoin remains the leader and could be an attractive option in the current market.

The cryptocurrency market is witnessing unprecedented milestones as leading coins reach remarkable levels. Amidst Bitcoin''s surge and XRP''s impressive performance, a new contender emerges. The presale of XYZVerse is capturing attention with the potential to attain a $1 billion market cap. Enthusiasts and investors are eager to explore what this next-generation platform brings to the table. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 - $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 - $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10?

2025-07-19 09:30:00+00:00,MARO: Elevated Risk Due To Bitcoin Exposure,"Summary MARO offers a massive 125% yield by harnessing MARA''s volatility, but its synthetic option strategy carries high risk and caps upside potential. The ETF is best suited for aggressive income seekers, not for growth or capital preservation, due to its declining price and speculative underlying asset. Distributions are inconsistent and not tax-efficient, making MARO more appropriate for tax-advantaged accounts and those who can handle payout variability. I rate MARO a hold, given the speculative nature of MARA, crypto volatility, and the risk of capital deterioration if sentiment shifts negatively. Overview YieldMax funds have earned a reputation for providing investors with a dividend yield that can be life changing under the right circumstances. I''ve covered a ton of these funds in the past, and I''ve always avoided a few specific ETFs due to the speculative nature of the underlying business. YieldMax MARA Option Income Strategy ETF ( MARO ) is one of the ETFs that I avoided because of the level of uncertainty around the business and the large levels of volatility. However, it''s this level of volatility that allows MARO to reward shareholders with a distribution rate that currently sits around 125%! MARO implements an option strategy that aims to harness the volatility of MARA Holdings ( MARA ). If you aren''t familiar, MARA is one of the leading Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining and digital asset technology companies in the world. The core of their business is essentially operating Bitcoin mining machines as well as validating transactions and securing the blockchain. Additionally, the business holds a large Bitcoin treasury, which causes the share price of the stock to change rapidly. If we look at the price of Bitcoin and MARA below, we can see the clear correlation over the last few years. Data by YCharts As we all know, Bitcoin is one of the most volatile assets on the planet, and this has always caused me to stay away from MARO. YieldMax funds have a poor reputation for deteriorating investor capital, and I feared that a decline in Bitcoin would cause MARO''s price to collapse. While MARO is trading substantially below its inception price, the decline isn''t nearly as bad as some YieldMax peers. MARO launched recently during December 2024, and the ETF has a gross expense ratio of 0.99%. Looking at the performance since inception, we can see how the price has declined by over 49%. When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return still sits around a loss of 13%. So let''s look at the fund strategy to determine whether or not MARO is worth the risk. Data by YCharts Fund Strategy MARO is a synthetic option ETF that is aimed at capturing the volatility of MARA. The term ''synthetic'' means that MARO doesn''t actually own any common shares of MARA, so it''s essentially writing options on a stock it doesn''t own. The synthetic nature of the fund means that there is an increased risk profile since MARO can experience price losses that are much larger than the actual declines that Mara Holdings. Over time, the price disconnect can increase substantially, especially if Bitcoin experiences a large run upward. So if you want exposure to Bitcoin or Mara Holdings, you''d be better off simply buying the underlying of each. For instance, MARO''s holdings reveal that it doesn''t actually hold any common shares or Bitcoin. MARO Holdings (YieldMax) MARO is best utilized by income investors that want to collect a high stream of cash flow. Investors should be aware that following the fund''s price decline so far, the ETF is very unlikely to experience any sort of positive growth, price resilience, or stability in the future. The highly volatile nature of Bitcoin and MARA makes me certain that MARO isn''t really useful for anything else except income generation. In order to generate the necessary income to fuel distributions, the fund chooses to simultaneously purchase ATM (at-the-money) call options and sell put options. The prospectus explains that in order to generate the option premiums, MARO sells OTM (out-of-the-money) call options that typically have a strike price somewhere between 0% and 15% above the current market price of MARA. The fund documents provided the helpful table below that can help explain the process. MARO Prospectus However, a significant drawback of option funds is the capped upside potential. Growth is essentially limited to whatever the selected strike price is. So if MARO writes an option and selects a strike price that is 5% above MARA''s market price, but MARA increases by 15%, MARO''s growth is capped at that 5% premium strike price. When this strategy is implemented over a prolonged bull market, MARO is aligned to underperform. The best-case scenario would be for MARA and Bitcoin to trade sideways or slowly rise for an extended period of time, so that MARO can capture both the growth while also rewarding shareholders with the premiums.

Will Polygon go up? And is Polygon a good investment? We bring our Polygon Price Prediction for 2025 – 2030 to explore the POL price prediction.

However, if conditions improve and POL successfully flips 200-day EMA bands, then in July, a retest of the 0.236 Fibonacci level at $0.30 could be on the horizon. On the contrary, if POL fails to break through the 20-day EMA, it could retreat to $0.15, with further bearish pressure potentially pushing it below $0.10. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Polygon Price Action July 2025 $0.10 $0.20 $0.30 Polygon Price Prediction 2025 The POL/USD daily chart on COINBASE reveals that since December 2024, the price has plummeted over 70%, with Q1 2025 significantly contributing to this decline. However, a shift occurred in April 2025 as bullish forces began to emerge, pushing the price towards the 0.236 level-based resistance by mid-May. Despite these efforts, the Polygon price remained low in Q2. However, it prepared a symmetrical triangle pattern in the past few months, and with the recent broader market rally and improved transaction volume in the Polygon network, its token is rising towards the Fibonacci 0.236 mark after breaking out from the symmetrical triangle’s upper border and inching towards the 200-day EMA band in order to flip it for a long-term uprise. This period of optimism manifested since last week in June onwards as bullish conviction of investors returned in the market from geopolitical easing, sparking a 45% boost by the third week of July. Nevertheless, if conditions keep on improving and POL retests and breaks the 0.236 Fibonacci level, then it will register a Change in Character (ChoCh) in its trend and could aim for the Fibonacci 0.5 level in Q3. In a more optimistic scenario, if before Q4 ends, POL sustains past the 0.50 Fibonacci level, then it might hit targets at the 0.786 and even the 1.0 Fibonacci levels by the end of 2025. However, if it fails to break through the Fibonacci 0.236 level, the price could retreat to $0.15, and further bearish pressure could push it below $0.10.

The gap between broader market performance and PI’s subdued valuation highlights deeper technical and structural issues. With the open mainnet anticipated in 2025, understanding Pi’s current position and its post-launch potential is critical for any price forecast. What’s the reason behind the sluggish Pi price rally? Will it rebound and rise in the coming months? Why Pi Price Isn’t Surging with the Crypto Market In the times when most of the altcoins are attempting to rise above the local resistance and slip the persisting bearish trend, Pi price remains calm. This divergence is rooted in technical limitations and market structure. Here are some reasons why the PI price is failing to gain strong bullish momentum. Enclosed Mainnet: It operates in its enclosed mainnet phase, where the PI tokens are non-transferable, not accessible on public block explorers and restricted to Pi’s internal apps No Official Exchange Listing: The crypto is listed on IOU representations but not on the actual tradable tokens. These cannot be withdrawn to a real Pi wallet, are unverified by the Pi core team and do not reflect real supply/demand dynamics. No On-Chain Volume: Unlike the other cryptos, PI does not have exchange access, high on-chain activity, DeFi, staking or NFT integration. It has zero footprint or smart contract-based utility, which makes it limited to organic and speculative growth What Could Change in the Rest of 2025? With the open mainnet launch expected sometime in 2025, Pi may finally unlock its on-chain functionality, shifting from speculative mining to tradable tokenomics. Besides, the Pi Core team has hinted at phased token unlocking mechanisms, including vesting periods, locking up for early miners and on-chain staking to delay circulation. On the other hand, to gain long-term value, Pi needs to evolve into a smart contract-enabled layer 1. This requires developer SDKs, dApp onboarding via Pi browser and gas fee utility for PI. The broader the use cases, the higher the transactional demand, which will support value accrual to native tokens in late 2025 and beyond. Pi Price Prediction 2025: Does PI have an Upside Potential to $5? PI has been experiencing massive selling pressure since its launch, which has shaken the confidence of the investors. As a result, the price has been maintaining a strong descending trend with fewer chances of a rebound. With the bears dominating the rally, is it possible for the PI price to rise to $5 in 2025? As seen in the above chart, the price is extending the falling wedge as the bears are nullifying the attempt for a breakout each time. The Bollinger bands have squeezed, which suggests a drop in the volume and volatility. This usually results in a massive breakout, but in the case of PI one cannot expect a larger price action. Mainly because the RSI is trading extremely lower, hinting towards a drop in the strength of the rally. With this, the possibility of a strong upswing could not be feasible in the near future.

2025-07-19 09:43:01+00:00,Wisconsin is considering new regulations to protect residents from crypto ATM scams,"Wisconsin is currently considering new laws to protect its residents from the menace of crypto scams. According to reports, residents in Wisconsin have lost thousands to the growing crypto scam, showing the need for better regulations that aim to protect them from losing more. The sheriff’s office in central Wisconsin also discussed the rise in fraud related to Bitcoin in the region, noting that one person lost as much as $40,000 in a single case. “Having these restrictions is only going to provide financial safety for our Community, and we’re super excited that someone’s moving forward with that,” said Investigative Lt. Scott Goldberg. Wisconsin set to unveil new laws to tackle crypto scams According to a newly proposed law , Bitcoin Treasury Machines are expected to be restricted, which means that if someone loses funds through one of these machines, the cryptocurrency company will refund the victim. In addition, the newly proposed regulation will also require every cryptocurrency machine company to post signs warning users about fraudulent transactions. Under the bill, only $1,000 in BTC can be sent at in a day, and fees charged by crypto firms will be reduced per transaction. Cryptocurrency fraud has been on the rise in the past few years, and fraud prevention experts have pointed to crypto ATMs as one of the favorite tools that scammers are now using to facilitate their crime. This is because these machines do not undergo the same regulatory process as traditional ATMs, and victims are not covered under any type of insurance for losses. “There’s no recovery, so that’s what makes these really, really difficult,” Scott Reeder, a loss prevention manager at UW Credit Union, said. “You can do police reports, but it’s just a dead end. There’s so much of this going on that there’s no resources to even look into recovering these funds.” In the past year, victims lost about $247 million to scams involving crypto ATMs, according to the FBI. The report also showed that the number of complaints the FBI received in 2024 over scams on crypto ATMs doubled. “Five years ago, we hardly ever heard about these, and it’s been a constant incline since, and it’s getting more and more prevalent,” Reeder said. According to authorities, a West Allis native who did not want to reveal her name due to privacy concerns reportedly lost $850 to a scam via a cryptocurrency ATM. Authorities claimed that the woman received a call from a man claiming to be a police officer with a warrant for her arrest. The woman said that the man said she had failed to appear in court, noting that it could be as a result of her aged mother misplacing the summons. “My mom has Alzheimer’s, and when he said the signature — he couldn’t make out — I thought it was my mom’s signature. So, I believed it right then and there,” she said. She added that she tried to investigate the claim, but every time she questioned him, he always dropped a subtle threat about her going to prison. She added that the scammer provided fake court paperwork to back his claim, asking her to clear up the situation by paying the fees she owed. To avoid being arrested, the man said she should wire the money from a nearby crypto ATM. “I knew nothing about Bitcoins,” Amy said. “I put the money in, and when I got back to the car, he proceeded to say he forgot something and wanted more money. And that’s when I snapped, and then he hung up the phone. And that’s when I knew I got scammed.” State Rep. Ryan Spaude, who authored the bill alongside Senator Kelda Roys, said if all the things proposed in the bill are adhered to, the rate of being defrauded via a crypto ATM drops drastically. “Cryptocurrency is here and actively being used — and we need to take steps to stop Wisconsinites from getting screwed,” Roys said. The Wisconsin Legislature is largely controlled by the Republicans, and without their support, the proposal may not become law. The next best thing for the sponsors of the bill is to look for cosponsors and hope to see bipartisan support for regulations for crypto ATMs. Meanwhile, Reeder has issued a warning to Wisconsin residents, urging them to stop and think before sending money to someone they have never met before using a crypto ATM under any circumstances. “If something just doesn’t make sense, you know, slow down. Ask for advice. Ask your financial: ‘Hey, does this make sense?’” he said.

2025-07-19 09:59:00+00:00,Bitcoin price flat below $120K as analysts cite early signs of altseason,"Bitcoin traded mostly sideways below $120,000 throughout the day, even as broader market sentiment remained bullish. Momentum leaned toward altcoins, with several analysts pointing to signs of an emerging altseason. By late Friday, Bitcoin had pared back its weekly gains. With risk-on sentiment back in full force, the total cryptocurrency market cap briefly crossed the $4 trillion mark for the first time before easing to around $3.9 trillion at press time. Friday’s sentiment metrics pointed to a subtle but notable shift in market dynamics. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index slipped to 73, down one point, while the Altcoin Season Index rose nearly 10 points to 47. The data suggests investors may be reassessing their positions, favouring altcoins amid broader optimism. Such periods, when a growing number of altcoins outperform Bitcoin, are commonly referred to as an altseason. Will Bitcoin go up? The macro trend for Bitcoin remains intact, though its 3% drop in dominance over the past day indicates reduced short-term strength as funds flow into outperforming altcoins. Traders appear to be rotating into altcoins, many of which have posted double-digit gains in recent sessions. However, Bitcoin’s long-term structure remains bullish, supported by strong technical patterns. According to trader Merlijn, a classic bullish indicator has reappeared on the daily chart. On Thursday, he highlighted the formation of a golden cross, when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA. See below.

The most recent golden cross was confirmed on May 22, when BTC/USD traded at around $107,000. Since then, Bitcoin has gained approximately 12%. Although modest by past standards, the pattern still offers scope for further upside. Merlijn pointed out that even a short-lived golden cross, like the one seen in 2016, would project a target of around $155,000. Some analysts say Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase is laying the groundwork for the next leg up. Rekt Capital, a widely followed crypto trader, noted on Friday that a daily close above the $120,000 range high, followed by a successful retest, would confirm a breakout to new highs. Rekt Capital @rektcapital · Follow #BTC Bitcoin remains in the Range and the consolidation continues, facilitating further money flow into AltcoinsDaily Close above ~$120k Range High resistance followed by a post-breakout retest would see Bitcoin confirm a breakout to new highs $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin 1:23 pm · 18 Jul 2025 369 Reply Copy link Read 29 replies Short-term hesitation aside, both technical indicators and analyst commentary suggest that Bitcoin remains positioned for further price discovery. Targets between $135,000 and $155,000 are now emerging as the next key milestones if bullish momentum resumes. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering around $118,000 with no gains on the weekly timeframe. Charts say altseason is here Since the low recorded on July 5, the total altcoin market cap has surged over 30%, reaching approximately $1.579 trillion by Friday, July 18. The rise comes as Bitcoin’s dominance slipped to 60.8%, its lowest level since mid-March, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s market share rose to 11.2%, marking its highest dominance since late January 2025. Ethereum has led the charge among top altcoins, climbing 43% over the past 30 days.

Bitcoin traded mostly sideways below $120,000 throughout the day, even as broader market sentiment remained bullish. Momentum leaned toward altcoins, with several analysts pointing to signs of an emerging altseason. By late Friday, Bitcoin had pared back its weekly gains. With risk-on sentiment back in full force, the total cryptocurrency market cap briefly crossed the $4 trillion mark for the first time before easing to around $3.9 trillion at press time. Friday’s sentiment metrics pointed to a subtle but notable shift in market dynamics. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index slipped to 73, down one point, while the Altcoin Season Index rose nearly 10 points to 47. The data suggests investors may be reassessing their positions, favouring altcoins amid broader optimism. Such periods, when a growing number of altcoins outperform Bitcoin, are commonly referred to as an altseason. Will Bitcoin go up? The macro trend for Bitcoin remains intact, though its 3% drop in dominance over the past day indicates reduced short-term strength as funds flow into outperforming altcoins. Traders appear to be rotating into altcoins, many of which have posted double-digit gains in recent sessions. However, Bitcoin’s long-term structure remains bullish, supported by strong technical patterns. According to trader Merlijn, a classic bullish indicator has reappeared on the daily chart. On Thursday, he highlighted the formation of a golden cross, when the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses above the 200-day SMA. See below.

Watch on Twitter View replies 4:30 pm · 17 Jul 2025 3.2K Reply Copy link Read 115 replies Historically, this signal has preceded major Bitcoin rallies, including the 2,000% surges seen in 2017 and 2020. The most recent golden cross was confirmed on May 22, when BTC/USD traded at around $107,000. Since then, Bitcoin has gained approximately 12%. Although modest by past standards, the pattern still offers scope for further upside. Merlijn pointed out that even a short-lived golden cross, like the one seen in 2016, would project a target of around $155,000. Some analysts say Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase is laying the groundwork for the next leg up. Rekt Capital, a widely followed crypto trader, noted on Friday that a daily close above the $120,000 range high, followed by a successful retest, would confirm a breakout to new highs. Rekt Capital @rektcapital · Follow #BTC Bitcoin remains in the Range and the consolidation continues, facilitating further money flow into AltcoinsDaily Close above ~$120k Range High resistance followed by a post-breakout retest would see Bitcoin confirm a breakout to new highs $BTC #Crypto #Bitcoin 1:23 pm · 18 Jul 2025 369 Reply Copy link Read 29 replies Short-term hesitation aside, both technical indicators and analyst commentary suggest that Bitcoin remains positioned for further price discovery. Targets between $135,000 and $155,000 are now emerging as the next key milestones if bullish momentum resumes. When writing, Bitcoin was hovering around $118,000 with no gains on the weekly timeframe. Charts say altseason is here Since the low recorded on July 5, the total altcoin market cap has surged over 30%, reaching approximately $1.579 trillion by Friday, July 18. The rise comes as Bitcoin’s dominance slipped to 60.8%, its lowest level since mid-March, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s market share rose to 11.2%, marking its highest dominance since late January 2025. Ethereum has led the charge among top altcoins, climbing 43% over the past 30 days.

2025-07-19 10:00:21+00:00,Bitcoin Price Crash Imminent? BTC Could Fall Back To This 4H FVG,"While the Bitcoin price has managed to hold close to its all-time high levels, there is still bearish pressure lurking in the background for the digital asset. With the surge to new peaks over the weekend, there have been multiple gaps created, and history suggests that Bitcoin will have to drop back down to fill these gaps before it can begin to rally again. These gaps now point to a return to its previous all-time high levels before the rally began last week. V-Shaped Pattern Shows Bears In Control Crypto analyst Youriverse explained the Bitcoin situation and why there could be a crash coming soon. First thing he pointed to was the fact that the cryptocurrency had made a V-shaped pattern after hitting its all-time high above $123,000, and this formation is usually bearish. This is because it shows a shift toward sellers being in control as profit-taking becomes more pronounced . This is only the start as more bearish developments are now in play. Two Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) were created on the 4-Hour chart, and one has already been filled. The first happened with the retest at $119,000 and $120,000, which eventually led to a rejection. Therefore, this leaves one more gap to be filled, and it’s the 4H FVG at its previous highs. This gives credence to the analysis and suggests that the other gaps created could be filled as well. The analyst puts the second 4H FVG just above $111,000, which coincides with the previous high turned resistance. He believes that this is what makes the level a “magnet,” especially as investors begin to take profit. Strong selling pressure could provide the added momentum needed for the price to fall toward the $111,000 level. Another major problem right now is that the Bitcoin price has formed a CME gap over the weekend, and with the retracement in price, the CME gap is looking filled at around the $114,000-$116,000 level. There has already been an attempt earlier in the week. But the $114,000 was not touched. If this CME gap is filled, then it makes it even more likely that the second FVG will be filled at $111,000. Bitcoin Price Still Shows Bullishness Although the bearishness of the gaps still looms heavy over the Bitcoin price, there is still bullishness left for the cryptocurrency. One example of this is the rising volume alongside the increase in price, suggesting that the volume is being dominated by buyers at this level. Coinglass data shows the daily volume has averaged over $100 billion this week. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is currently still in Greed, and is yet to enter the Extreme Greed territory, which is usually when a top is marked. Open interest is also sitting close to all-time high levels, which could lead to a price push before a correction.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-crash-imminent-2/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK,Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,BTC,"Bitcoin Price Crash Imminent?

2025-07-19 10:20:27+00:00,Canadian county Westlock is expected to revisit its regulations,"Canadian county Westlock is expected to revisit its regulations as deliberations are ongoing to allow crypto firms to build larger facilities in the region. This new amendment to its bylaw follows a rise in proposals for high-powered facilities. According to the new amendments , the larger digital infrastructure projects will take up space and operate in the industrial zones in the county. The Data Processing Facilities Bylaw was reintroduced by the Westlock County administration at the regular council meeting on July 8. The new amendment is expected to allow digital firms to enter the region and build larger facilities in the Canadian county. Canadian county revisits Data Processing Facilities Bylaw The amendment to the bylaw, which was initially passed on April 12, 2022, was presented to the councilors by Julie McLean, the general manager for the planning and community services department at Westlock County. According to records, a data processing facility is a dedicated space that is used to house computer systems and components for the digital transactions required for processing data. It includes processing digital currency, non-fungible tokens, and blockchain transactions. This new amendment is expected to have two divisions, which the data processing facilities can be categorized into based on the amount of electrical energy required. Any proposals for larger facilities that use one megawatt or more are categorized under Major Facilities, which are only allowed to operate out of the industrial land areas. In comparison, facilities that use less than one megawatt, which are classified under Minor Facilities, can be housed anywhere, depending on the discretion of the development authority. However, the Canadian county’s law states that agricultural lands can be rezoned to become industrial land, provided there is enough need for it and people’s concerns are looked into. “Agriculture land can be rezoned to industrial land, but it requires a public hearing process for the opportunity of adjacent land owners to voice concerns and for council to decide on the land use whereas a development permit application, like if it’s a discretionary use in the AG District, then the decision is just made by the Municipal Planning Commission,” McLean said. This new development is coming after McLean reported a rise in the number of proposals for larger facilities that have been brought to the county through the Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC). While the exact number remains unknown, one facility has been given the greenlight from the AUC for their power generation component use, but “they don’t have jurisdiction over the actual data processing portion of the use”, a decision that falls on the municipality. Noise pollution remains a major issue of data processing facilities One of the biggest impacts of data processing facilities still remains the noise pollution that comes with their operations. They generate a low hum noise that is annoying to residents within the surrounding areas, as well as the increase in traffic and construction noise. In section 7.21.16, a new addition would enable the development authority to request a noise mitigation plan that may include the need for a noise monitoring program. The Canadian county passed the first bylaw back in 2022 after an increase in proposals and applications for Bitcoin mining in the area. The move led to dozens of questions, concerns, and complaints from residents. County manager of planning and development Ted Traikovski told councilors at the time that his department was swamped with concerns and complaints over the Bitcoin mines. The Canadian county became one of the first to tackle the influx of bitcoin mining alongside Sturgeon County. Councilors have now carried the motion to give the bylaw a first reading and for the administration to schedule a public hearing connected to the new amendment. The Canadian county has said the hearing is expected to take place on September 9 at 9:30 AM. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth.

The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization.

2025-07-19 10:44:25+00:00,"BTC inflows to exchanges hit 81K BTC as whales, miners cash in on rally","Bitcoin miners have resumed selling BTC following the flagship asset reaching a new all-time high. On-chain data analytics provider CryptoQuant noted that outflows from miners reached 16,000 BTC on July 15. According to the firm , this has been the largest outflow from miners since April 7. With the miners moving all the BTC to exchanges, CryptoQuant noted that they might have sold in reaction to BTC’s new all-time high. Bitcoin miners’ outflow metrics (Source: CryptoQuant) It said: “The total miner outflows, transfers of Bitcoin out of miners’ wallets, spiked to 16K BTC on July 15, representing an extreme outflow according to our metrics.” The recent selloffs by miners have already been reflected in the Miner Position Index (MPI) surge, according to crypto analyst Avocado_Onchain. The analyst noted that the MPI, which indicates miners’ transfer to exchange, has increased to 2.7, which could bring more short-term selling pressure to the market. Meanwhile, miners are not the only ones selling BTC at the present top. CryptoQuant data noted that overall Bitcoin transfers to exchanges have increased since BTC hit the $123,000 peak, with whales being a major driver for the spike. CryptoQuant stated: “Total daily Bitcoin exchange inflows surged from 19K Bitcoin a week ago to 81K BTC on July 15, after Bitcoin reached its most recent record-high price.” Data shows that whales are responsible for this increase, with the large BTC holders sending 58,000 BTC this week compared to 13,000 last week. These fund movements reflect profit-taking efforts by whales capitalizing on retail investors’ resurgent interest in Bitcoin. For miners, most of whom have been holding on to mined BTC to boost their BTC treasury, the selloff over the past week is likely them taking advantage of the price to quickly generate more cash flow. ETH sees spike in exchange deposits Interestingly, it was not only Bitcoin that saw increased exchange inflows in the past week. Even Ether , which recently returned to green for the first time this year, appears to be experiencing some selloffs already. CryptoQuant data shows that daily Ether inflows to exchanges reached almost 2 million ETH on July 16, the highest level since February. This shows that the 131% rally that ETH has experienced since April has finally returned it to a price where investors are open to selling. However, altcoin inflows transactions were relatively muted, contrary to what usually follows market rallies such as this. It is a sign that investors are not rushing to sell, likely because most altcoins remain within minimal gains or even small losses year-to-date, making it unattractive for investors to sell. BTC declines, but analysts believe the crypto market rally remains on Meanwhile, the recent selloffs have led to a price correction that has seen BTC drop from its peak to $118,000 while altcoins such as Ethereum, Solana, and XRP also recorded a similar drop in value. However, most market observers consider the decline a mere correction rather than the end of the market rally. Avocado_Onchain noted that the effect of miners selling will depend on whether it is a one-off or sustained event. He said; “While this spike in MPI suggests the possibility of short-term correction or sideways price action, it remains far below the extreme levels typically observed at the end of previous bull cycles.” Therefore, he believes the “mid-to-long term bullish outlook for Bitcoin remains intact” and expects that the flagship asset will continue to trend upward for the time being as the underlying factors support this trajectory. Other analysts also share this view, with on-chain analyst Crypto Dan also noting no sign of overheating in the market compared to March and December 2024.

2025-07-19 10:50:37+00:00,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Genius Act Becomes Law After Tumultuous Crypto Week – What’s the BTC Impact?,"President Donald Trump signed the landmark GENIUS Act into law on Friday afternoon , capping a tumultuous “Crypto Week” that saw Bitcoin navigate significant volatility before establishing new institutional legitimacy. The stablecoin legislation passed the House 308-122 after Trump’s Tuesday night Oval Office intervention with Republican holdouts rescued it from legislative limbo. Bitcoin is currently trading around $119,000 and has pulled back from its all-time high of $123,000 , but maintains critical support levels, suggesting continued bullish momentum. The breakthrough followed an initial 196-223 defeat that seemed like the end. Trump’s diplomacy secured a 215-211 procedural victory , clearing the path for final passage. The GENIUS Act establishes federal licensing requirements for stablecoin issuers and explicitly prohibits the creation of central bank digital currencies. Industry executives hailed the legislation as the beginning of a new regulatory era, which is expected to accelerate institutional adoption. With Bitcoin forming flag consolidation patterns following recent volatility, technical analysis suggests the current pullback represents an accumulation opportunity before the next leg higher toward $180,000 targets. Flag Pattern Consolidation Targets $181,040 Breakout Bitcoin’s chart structure reveals progression through ascending flag patterns that have consistently resolved upward throughout the current bull cycle. The recent pullback from $123,000 to current levels is forming another flag consolidation within the broader uptrend. Each previous breakout was preceded by a major upward move following a period of consolidation. The measured move projection above $150,000 represents approximately 35% upside from current levels. Source: TradingView This technical methodology has proven accurate throughout Bitcoin’s bull run. Key support areas have consistently attracted buyers during previous pullbacks, suggesting that similar dynamics may be at play now. Flag patterns within strong uptrends typically represent continuation rather than reversal signals. Current price action suggests that Bitcoin is building momentum for another explosive move once the pattern is complete. Long-Term Holders Drive Healthy Distribution Pattern Additionally, on-chain analysis reveals that recent selling pressure stems from holders with a tenure of 10 years or more taking profits, rather than a broad-based distribution. These longest-term holders, who acquired Bitcoin at extremely low prices, have been selling after Bitcoin reached new highs above $120,000. The selling spike is substantial but appears contained to this specific age cohort. Source: Coinvo Historical context proves revealing. Previous major selling from long-term holders occurred in March 2024, coinciding with a price correction but ultimately followed by Bitcoin’s rally to new highs. This pattern suggests selling pressure gets absorbed by new demand without derailing broader uptrends. Current selling pressure is moderating based on recent data. This profit-taking benefits long-term sustainability by transferring Bitcoin from early adopters to new participants more likely to hold at current levels. BTC Hyper: Last Chance for $HYPER Presale Before Window Closes The passage of the GENIUS Act creates unprecedented regulatory clarity, positioning Bitcoin Layer-2 solutions for explosive growth. BTC Hyper’s $HYPER token presale has raised over $3.5 million toward its presale target, with a few days remaining before the presale window closes permanently. Early investors are rushing to secure positions in the platform that enables instant, low-cost Bitcoin transactions while unlocking DeFi capabilities. The $HYPER token offers exclusive benefits, including high APY staking rewards for presale participants and governance rights in the upcoming DAO launch.

2025-07-19 11:03:06+00:00,Coinbase CLO Exposes 5 U.S. States for Defying CLARITY’s Crypto Staking Rules,"The post Coinbase CLO Exposes 5 U.S. States for Defying CLARITY’s Crypto Staking Rules appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal is making his frustration clear. In a direct post on X , he called out five U.S. states for pushing forward with legal action against crypto staking, even after Congress passed a bill that says staking-as-a-service is not a security. “I gotta call out one critical provision of CLARITY Act that hasn’t received the attention it is due: staking-as-a-service is confirmed as a non-security and rule-making is ordered,” Grewal wrote. The law he’s referring to is the CLARITY Act , which passed the House last month with strong bipartisan support. It clearly states that staking services offered by crypto platforms should not be treated as securities, which is a big deal for the industry. Five States Under Fire Despite that clarity, California, New Jersey, Washington, Maryland, and Wisconsin are still pursuing claims against Coinbase over its staking services.

The post Coinbase CLO Exposes 5 U.S. States for Defying CLARITY’s Crypto Staking Rules appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal is making his frustration clear. In a direct post on X , he called out five U.S. states for pushing forward with legal action against crypto staking, even after Congress passed a bill that says staking-as-a-service is not a security. “I gotta call out one critical provision of CLARITY Act that hasn’t received the attention it is due: staking-as-a-service is confirmed as a non-security and rule-making is ordered,” Grewal wrote. The law he’s referring to is the CLARITY Act , which passed the House last month with strong bipartisan support. It clearly states that staking services offered by crypto platforms should not be treated as securities, which is a big deal for the industry. Five States Under Fire Despite that clarity, California, New Jersey, Washington, Maryland, and Wisconsin are still pursuing claims against Coinbase over its staking services. Grewal says these actions directly ignore the law and what’s more, he points out that 32 Democratic lawmakers from those same states actually voted for the CLARITY Act.

2025-07-19 11:10:25+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Settles Around $118,000, Is Another July All-Time High Possible?","Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading below the $120,000 mark. Analysts believe the flagship cryptocurrency’s rally is only taking a breather, and have not ruled out another bull run before the end of the month. BTC’s latest rally saw its price surge past $123,000, settling an all-time high of $123,091 before losing momentum as selling pressure returned, thanks to traders locking in their profits. Bitcoin Dominance Drops As Altcoins Rise Bitcoin (BTC) dominance fell as Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) dominance rose sharply over the past week. However, analysts are unsure if the decline will translate into a sustained increase for altcoins. According to Adrian Fritz, head of research at Switzerland-based asset manager 21Shares, while altcoins are surging, there needs to be a trend reversal for the so-called “altcoin season” to begin. Bitcoin dominance stood at $2.3 trillion or 61% of the total market, according to data from CoinGecko. Meanwhile, Ethereum dominance jumped 23% and XRP dominance rose 23% as the latter hit a record high. Previous market cycles have seen altcoins surge after Bitcoin’s price has peaked, suggesting that traders pivot to other assets as the bull market continues. However, market dynamics have changed in recent years with the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs, allowing more investors access to the flagship cryptocurrency. Fritz added, “It’s hard to imagine that Bitcoin’s dominance drops to levels that we''ve seen in previous bull markets. Over the last year, the spotlight has definitely been on Bitcoin.” Satoshi-Era Whale Could Secure Unprecedented Profits A Satoshi-era whale who shifted the remaining 40,912 Bitcoin to Galaxy Digital could be on the verge of securing unprecedented profits after over a decade of holding the asset. The whale made an initial transfer of 40,009 Bitcoin on Tuesday, before transferring the remaining, worth nearly $5 billion. Blockchain on-chain data service Onchain Lens was the first to notice the transfer. The latest transfer means the whale has moved all his Bitcoin holdings, worth $9.6 billion, to Galaxy Digital. The whale has already transferred 6,000 Bitcoin to Binance and Bybit, according to blockchain intelligence platform Nansen. Kadan Stadelmann, chief technology officer at Komodo Platforms, stated that no one could be sure what the whale’s motivations are for moving his holdings. Stadelmann speculated that the whale may have decided it was a good time to secure “jaw-dropping profits.” “The whale may simply want stability for their family or plan to start a new venture. Maybe they are going to fund off-grid projects that align with the self-reliance vision of Bitcoin.” However, Stadelmann also suggested that the whale could have mixed feelings about liquidating their holdings after Bitcoin’s increasing institutional adoption. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally down over the past 24 hours, trading around $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has struggled to reclaim the $120,000 mark, facing repeated rejections since losing the level after Monday’s rally. Analysts believe BTC could enter a brief consolidation phase after recent record highs. However, they have not ruled out another rally before the end of the month. According to Michael Harvey, Galaxy Digital’s head of franchise trading, BTC could trend higher towards the end of 2025. “Consolidation around current prices is my base case given the large rally and new ATH. I do expect BTC to trend higher into the year-end, but pausing here for air would be realistic. I think the best case BTC price into month end is a continued slow melt-up.” Harvey stated that if bulls lose momentum and bearish sentiment takes over, BTC could drop back below $110,000. “Bear case is a risk-off move driven by profit taking and/or equity market weakness, which I believe could see BTC retrace 5-10%.” BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping 0.88% to $108,273. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% to $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose 2.12% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as BTC rallied, increasing 3.51% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,134. The price continued pushing higher on Friday, rising 1.50% and settling at $116,885. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $116,616. The price recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. Source: TradingView BTC aced past $123,000 on Monday, surging to a new all-time high of $123,091.

The price fell to an intraday low of $115,701 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it recovered from this level and settled at $117,682, a drop of nearly 2%.

2025-07-19 11:23:06+00:00,"Peter Schiff Slams Trump’s Crypto Bills, Calls Bitcoin a “Ponzi Scheme”","The post Peter Schiff Slams Trump’s Crypto Bills, Calls Bitcoin a “Ponzi Scheme” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Gold advocate and long-time crypto critic Peter Schiff has taken aim at the U.S. government’s latest pro-crypto move, calling the newly signed GENIUS Act, CLARITY Act, and anti-CBDC bill a “legislative low point.” While the crypto community, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , cheered the passing of these bills as a historic win for digital assets, Schiff warned that they may actually weaken the U.S. dollar and boost what he calls a “decentralized Ponzi scheme” in Bitcoin. The main purpose of the ""landmark"" crypto bills is to cloak Bitcoin—nothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme—in the trappings of legitimacy. The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It’s a legislative low point. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Crypto Bills Trigger Market Pullback Rather than rallying on the news, crypto prices dipped. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 2%, while top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) pulled back after recent gains. Schiff believes this proves the legislation is more about hype than substance. “The industry is using these bills to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices,” he said, warning that the bills are fueling short-term gains at the cost of long-term stability. Schiff: Stablecoins Won’t Save the Dollar The GENIUS Act supports dollar-pegged stablecoins, which is a move praised by industry leaders like Rum’s Chris Pavlovski and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , who claim it will strengthen the dollar’s global position. But Schiff strongly disagrees. “Stablecoins are only as strong as the U.S. dollar itself,” he argued, calling the idea “nonsense” and warning that this supposed stability will fade as the dollar continues to weaken. He remains firm in his belief that gold, not Bitcoin or stablecoins, is the real store of value. Trump’s Crypto Push: Bold or Risky? Alongside the new bills, Trump is also pushing for an executive order to allow 401(k) retirement investments in Bitcoin and crypto. Schiff sees this as a dangerous move that could speed up the dollar’s decline. “Bitcoiners may cheer, as most bought Bitcoin to profit from a dollar crash. But ironically, gold will be the winner – Bitcoin will crash too,” he said. How Will This Move Shape Up? Schiff’s warnings raise serious questions about where the U.S. is headed with its new pro-crypto stance. While many see these bills as a step forward, critics like Schiff argue they may backfire, risking more harm to the economy than help.

The post Peter Schiff Slams Trump’s Crypto Bills, Calls Bitcoin a “Ponzi Scheme” appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Gold advocate and long-time crypto critic Peter Schiff has taken aim at the U.S. government’s latest pro-crypto move, calling the newly signed GENIUS Act, CLARITY Act, and anti-CBDC bill a “legislative low point.” While the crypto community, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse , cheered the passing of these bills as a historic win for digital assets, Schiff warned that they may actually weaken the U.S. dollar and boost what he calls a “decentralized Ponzi scheme” in Bitcoin. The main purpose of the ""landmark"" crypto bills is to cloak Bitcoin—nothing more than a decentralized Ponzi scheme—in the trappings of legitimacy. The industry is using them to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices. It’s a legislative low point. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) July 18, 2025 Crypto Bills Trigger Market Pullback Rather than rallying on the news, crypto prices dipped. Bitcoin (BTC) fell 2%, while top altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Solana (SOL) pulled back after recent gains. Schiff believes this proves the legislation is more about hype than substance. “The industry is using these bills to hype Bitcoin and other cryptos so insiders can cash out at higher prices,” he said, warning that the bills are fueling short-term gains at the cost of long-term stability. Schiff: Stablecoins Won’t Save the Dollar The GENIUS Act supports dollar-pegged stablecoins, which is a move praised by industry leaders like Rum’s Chris Pavlovski and Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong , who claim it will strengthen the dollar’s global position. But Schiff strongly disagrees. “Stablecoins are only as strong as the U.S. dollar itself,” he argued, calling the idea “nonsense” and warning that this supposed stability will fade as the dollar continues to weaken. He remains firm in his belief that gold, not Bitcoin or stablecoins, is the real store of value. Trump’s Crypto Push: Bold or Risky? Alongside the new bills, Trump is also pushing for an executive order to allow 401(k) retirement investments in Bitcoin and crypto. Schiff sees this as a dangerous move that could speed up the dollar’s decline. “Bitcoiners may cheer, as most bought Bitcoin to profit from a dollar crash. But ironically, gold will be the winner – Bitcoin will crash too,” he said. How Will This Move Shape Up? Schiff’s warnings raise serious questions about where the U.S. is headed with its new pro-crypto stance. While many see these bills as a step forward, critics like Schiff argue they may backfire, risking more harm to the economy than help.

2025-07-19 11:24:00+00:00,4 Signs of a Trillion-Dollar Sea Change in Bitcoin Valuations,"Bitcoin’s price cruised to a historical record high price level of around almost $123K earlier this week. Over the past 30 days, the asset is up by about 13%, at the time of this writing. Meanwhile, the comparable 30-day window posted 4.73% gains for the most popular US stock index. In other words, Bitcoin gained what the S&P 500 Index averages in a typical year in under one week while the stock market stalled. Moreover, for the month’s trades, BTC delivered returns on investment at nearly 3x the pace of stocks. With both Bitcoin and US stocks trading at historic record highs, the 30D BTC Pearson correlation to the S&P 500 climbed from slightly inverse at the start of July to a 72% positive correlation by 7/11. But the cryptocurrency is climbing higher and faster. That’s because its total market capitalization is much lower than the S&P 500’s, so it’s easier for bullish markets to move the needle. It’s also because Bitcoin is still relatively new and not as far along the adoption curve for its total addressable market as US stock favorites like Apple and Google. Here are four signs of a trillion-dollar sea change in Bitcoin valuations. 1. Bitcoin Price Historical All-Time High After hitting its ATH, Bitcoin’s market cap floated at $2.34 trillion. One trillion dollars ago, the last time the BTC economy moved at a $1.34 trillion market cap, it was May 28th, 2024. That was a trillion dollars added by saver-investors and users in just 13-and-a-half months. As the currency gathers pace to the peak of this multi-year bull run, it could pull that trick again in even less time. Wall Street is stoking this rally, diverting billions of dollars a week away from stocks and to Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. Leveraged derivatives and futures traders are also pouring on the rocket fuel. On the current come up, BTC’s market cap just eclipsed Google’s and the global market valuation for all above-ground silver. That’s a major milestone for Bitcoin, a powerful and useful engine, and a payments and savings platform like silver markets. But unlike silver, BTC can move around the world nearly as fast as lightning. Unlike Google, it is secured by the blockchain. 2. US Govt Now Accepts BTC For Home Loans The US government now officially accepts Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as financial collateral for home loans through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. “Previously,” reported USA Today, “mortgage applicants had to convert any Bitcoin holdings into U.S. dollars if they wanted their crypto to count.” But now BTC holders can keep their crypto and list it as an asset on federal mortgage applications. Earlier, on 7/6, Benzinga and Yahoo Finance highlighted a question about Bitcoin’s use case that someone asked on Reddit: “If only 5% of the population owns BTC, what is the use case? So, if 19 million bitcoin are presently ‘minted’ and only 4% of the population are holders… What good is a ‘currency’ that only 5% of the population owns???” The article noted the stakes for Bitcoin’s market valuation, calling the answer to the Redditor’s question “a fundamental tension that’s been brewing in the crypto space for years.” At the end of June, the US Federal Housing Finance Agency has now taken one of the most compelling use cases for Bitcoin in its history and made it real. 3. Corporations, Whales, and VCs Bullish Murano Global, the techie real estate lending platform with a hot new stock on the Nasdaq, just signed an equity funding agreement in July to buy $500 million worth of Bitcoin. So the company is selling its own stock to buy as much as half a billion USD worth of BTC with the proceeds. Under this arrangement, investors give Murano a dollar in return for a dollar’s worth of their company’s stock. Murano turns around and uses that dollar to buy a dollar’s worth of Bitcoin. This supercharges the investor’s stake in the company with the promise of corporate finances hedged by Bitcoin from the risks of inflation and wasteful corporate spending. And that’s just an isolated example – you also have your Strategies, Metaplanets, and all other companies that are running this playbook to perfection during this cycle. 80,000 BTC From 2011 Make A Monster Splash The growing market of long-term corporate Bitcoin buyer-holders may have a willing seller in the mysterious “Sleeping Beauty” BTC addresses that have remained locked since 2011. In the first half of July, these 80,000 BTC moved for the first time in nearly a decade and a half. They may already be sold, or the owner may be getting them ready to scoop long-awaited profits in anticipation of a rally peak that this monster Bitcoin whale just can’t pass up at the moment. It’s not just Internet whales and corporate CFOs who are still outrageously bullish for the class-leading cryptocurrency. VCs are back to funding new blockchain startups in earnest. Bitcoin is back to raising venture capital at levels unseen since the last bull market peak in 2022.

2025-07-19 11:30:37+00:00,Bitcoin Miner Sales Surge To Highest Level Since April – Details,"Bitcoin is currently holding above the $115,000 level after setting a new all-time high of approximately $123,000 last Monday. The price structure remains firmly bullish, with buyers still in control, but growing signs suggest the potential for a short-term correction. Momentum has slowed, and the market is entering a consolidation phase as traders reassess risk. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Signals Aggressive Ethereum Accumulation: Institutional Demand Accelerates According to new data from CryptoQuant, Bitcoin miner selling has surged sharply. On July 15, the same day Bitcoin reached its latest peak, daily BTC inflows to exchanges jumped from 19,000 BTC to 81,000 BTC — a clear sign that major holders, including miners and whales, took advantage of high prices to offload assets. Notably, miner outflows spiked to 16,000 BTC, the highest daily level since April, and nearly all of it was sent directly to exchanges. These inflows suggest a shift in sentiment among large players, raising the probability of increased supply pressure in the short term. While the broader trend remains intact, and fundamentals like long-term holder activity are still strong, the spike in exchange deposits is a classic signal to watch. Whether this leads to a deeper pullback or simply a healthy reset will likely be decided in the coming days. Miners Take Profits As Bitcoin Hits All-Time High Fresh data from CryptoQuant reveals that Bitcoin miners have resumed aggressive selling behavior as BTC reached a new all-time high of ~$123,000. On July 15, miner outflows spiked to 16,000 BTC — the highest single-day total since April 7. This level of activity represents what analysts at CryptoQuant describe as an “extreme outflow,” indicating that miners seized the opportunity to take profits at elevated prices. The miners sent nearly all the BTC they withdrew from their wallets directly to centralized exchanges. This reinforces the interpretation that the move was not simply a strategic reallocation but an active decision to sell into market strength. Such behavior often signals growing caution among miners, who may expect either near-term price exhaustion or are simply capitalizing on favorable conditions after months of holding. Miner behavior has long been viewed as a leading indicator of potential market shifts. When outflows rise — particularly to exchanges — it tends to precede increased volatility or temporary tops. While the broader Bitcoin trend remains bullish and investor demand stays strong, this wave of miner selling injects a dose of uncertainty.

This zone is now acting as a short-term channel, with buyers defending the $115K area while facing resistance around $123K. The latest daily candle shows low volatility, suggesting indecision among traders as Bitcoin pauses after its recent breakout. Volume has tapered off following a massive spike that coincided with the all-time high breakout, a potential signal of exhaustion or reduced participation from large buyers. The 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $108,796 remains well below the current price, confirming the bullish momentum is still intact, but any breakdown below the $115K level could bring the 50-day SMA into focus as a potential support.

2025-07-19 11:32:15+00:00,"Ethereum Hits 6-Month High: ETF Surge, Stablecoin Law Set the Stage","The post Ethereum Hits 6-Month High: ETF Surge, Stablecoin Law Set the Stage appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market cap currently stands at $3.93 trillion, with Bitcoin holding steady above $118,000. Ethereum is trading at $3,557 and XRP at $3.43, both showing minimal movement in the day. In a major move, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18, creating the first clear U.S. framework for stablecoin regulation. This is expected to unlock a wave of institutional capital and accelerate crypto adoption. Ethereum Hits 6-Month High with 50% Rally Ethereum is making headlines and has jumped to a six-month high of $3,677 on July 18, marking a 50% rally since it dipped near $2,400 earlier this month. One big reason for its recent surge is the passage of the GENIUS Act, which finally brings some clear rules for stablecoins and is crucial for Ethereum’s ecosystem. Rising institutional interest and record inflows into spot ETH ETFs and staking activity are also fueling the price run. ETH ETFs Overtake Bitcoin in Daily Inflows For the first time ever, Ethereum ETFs outpaced Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. On Thursday, US spot Ether ETFs pulled in $602 million, beating the $522.6 million that went into Bitcoin funds. The surge follows a record-setting $726 million inflow into ETH ETFs the day before. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge, pulling in $550 million and outperforming its own Bitcoin product.

The post Ethereum Hits 6-Month High: ETF Surge, Stablecoin Law Set the Stage appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market cap currently stands at $3.93 trillion, with Bitcoin holding steady above $118,000. Ethereum is trading at $3,557 and XRP at $3.43, both showing minimal movement in the day. In a major move, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on July 18, creating the first clear U.S. framework for stablecoin regulation. This is expected to unlock a wave of institutional capital and accelerate crypto adoption. Ethereum Hits 6-Month High with 50% Rally Ethereum is making headlines and has jumped to a six-month high of $3,677 on July 18, marking a 50% rally since it dipped near $2,400 earlier this month. One big reason for its recent surge is the passage of the GENIUS Act, which finally brings some clear rules for stablecoins and is crucial for Ethereum’s ecosystem. Rising institutional interest and record inflows into spot ETH ETFs and staking activity are also fueling the price run. ETH ETFs Overtake Bitcoin in Daily Inflows For the first time ever, Ethereum ETFs outpaced Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. On Thursday, US spot Ether ETFs pulled in $602 million, beating the $522.6 million that went into Bitcoin funds. The surge follows a record-setting $726 million inflow into ETH ETFs the day before. BlackRock’s ETHA led the charge, pulling in $550 million and outperforming its own Bitcoin product. James Seyffart noted the rise in demand for Ethereum ETFs and shared that they’ve pulled in over $5.5 billion since launch, with $3.3 billion of that coming in just since mid-April.

2025-07-19 12:20:25+00:00,"Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki: What AI Predicts About Their Future After Bitcoin’s ATH","Artificial intelligence offers new insights on the future of popular meme coins in the wake of Bitcoin''s all-time high. Curious minds will discover predictions that reveal which cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Floki, are poised for significant growth. Dive into the analysis to uncover which digital assets may lead the next wave of the crypto boom. The analysis is provided by Outset PR , a data-driven communications agency specializing in strategic crypto insights. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Edges Up Amid Optimistic Market Sentiment Source: tradingview Shiba Inu (SHIB) is oscillating between 0.00001187 and 0.00001429 dollars. It shows a 21.74% climb in the past month. SHIB is aiming to break the nearest hurdle at 0.00001529 dollars. If successful, it could push towards the second resistance at 0.00001771 dollars, marking a leap of about 25% from its current stance. The coin''s trajectory stays hopeful as it hovers above a supportive line at 0.00001045 dollars. Despite a rough six months, reflecting a 40.31% dip, the short-term indicators hint at a potential rebound, suggesting that SHIB could attract interest from traders seeking upward movement. Dogecoin Price Holds Steady; Eyes 30% Jump to Resistance Source: tradingview Dogecoin is experiencing a stable phase, hovering between 17 and 22 cents. Its recent momentum indicates a 19% rise in the past week and a 26% increase over the past month. The coin''s upcoming challenge is the resistance level at 24 cents. If buyers gain traction, Dogecoin might jump to this level, marking nearly a 30% increase from current prices. The Relative Strength Index at around 66 suggests room for more buying power. For those optimistic about Dogecoin, the 29-cent mark is the next target. However, any downturn could see a retreat to the support at 14 cents, so buyers need to watch these key levels. FLOKI Coin Shows Strong Weekly Rise Amidst Constant Volatility Source: tradingview FLOKI is on the rise, with a recent price jump seen over the past week. The coin is currently priced between an eighth and a tenth of a cent. It is pushing towards the nearest resistance at about twelve-thousandths of a cent. Its weekly increase is over forty percent, hinting at solid upward momentum, though it''s still below the ten-day moving average. Should it break through resistance, FLOKI could see potential growth to nearly fourteen-thousandths of a cent, which is almost thirty-two percent above its range. While the month has been bullish with nearly seventy percent growth, price fluctuations remain a hallmark for this crypto.

According to Zeberg, the stock could soon present “the greatest shorting opportunity,” he said in an X post on July 18. #MSTR will be the greatest shorting opportunity of a life time! Not yet! But it is coming — Henrik Zeberg (@HenrikZeberg) July 18, 2025 Zeberg cautioned that Strategy’s deep exposure to Bitcoin may eventually crash its balance sheet, stating that every time a company adds Bitcoin to its treasury, it “plants a small bomb” in its financials. He argued that the risk isn’t if Bitcoin tumbles again, but when. According to Zeberg, such a scenario could damage not only Strategy’s market capitalization but also its cash flow, access to credit, and investor confidence. “Every time a company adds Bitcoin to its treasury, it plants a small bomb in its balance sheet. Not if BTC tumbles again — but when — those bombs go off. And when they do, they don’t just dent the market cap. They hit cash flow, credit lines, and confidence,” he added. It’s worth noting that Strategy’s pivot toward Bitcoin has been led by executive chairman Michael Saylor, who doubled down on his conviction, claiming that “the only thing better than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin.” Saylor’s bet has so far paid off, with the stock having surged approximately 3,500% over the past five years, outperforming Bitcoin’s 905% rise over the same period. MSTR short interest rising But while Strategy continues to outpace both Bitcoin and traditional market benchmarks, short sellers are taking notice. According to the latest data retrieved from Fintel by Finbold on July 19, short volume in MSTR has risen significantly. On July 18, 2025, short volume stood at 3.76 million shares out of a total trading volume of 6.74 million, resulting in a short volume ratio of 55.7%, the highest in the past ten trading days. Short interest has remained elevated throughout the period, with ratios consistently above 47% on most days, suggesting mounting bearish sentiment. MSTR short volume.

The U.S is making fast decisions, Ripple vs SEC is back to make headlines, and fresh momentum built around some of the industry’s biggest tokens. There’s policy, price action, and just enough controversy to keep things interesting. If you missed anything, don’t worry – I’ve put the key updates in one place. Let’s dive in. #1 Gamechanger for Crypto? GENIUS Act Is Now Official It’s official: the U.S. just passed its first real stablecoin law. The GENIUS Act, a long-awaited bill to regulate dollar-backed stablecoins, was signed into law by President Trump after clearing the House with bipartisan support (308-122). The new rules require stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets like U.S. dollars and short-term Treasuries, with monthly public reserve disclosures. Trump called it “a giant step to cement the American dominance of global finance and crypto technology.” It’s the clearest signal yet that stablecoins are going mainstream; now with rules to match. #2 Trump to Allow 401(k) Investments in Crypto, Gold, and Private Equity Donald Trump is preparing to open up America’s $9 trillion retirement savings market to crypto, gold, and private equity. A new executive order, expected this week, would push regulators to clear the way for 401(k) plans to include alternative investments, not just stocks and bonds. The White House says Trump is focused on “restoring prosperity for everyday Americans.” It’s also a major win for crypto, coming after Trump backed multiple digital asset bills and rolled back restrictions on crypto in retirement accounts. #3 SC Becomes First Global Bank to Offer Regulated BTC, ETH Trading Standard Chartered just became the first global bank to offer spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum. The service, rolled out via its UK subsidiary, is aimed squarely at institutions. Clients can now trade BTC and ETH on the same system they already use for currencies. This is part of a much bigger strategy that’s been years in the making, from Zodia Custody to Libeara. As CEO Bill Winters put it: “Digital assets are a fundamental part of the evolution of financial services.” #4 No Surprise, But No Relief: CPI at 2.7% in June June’s inflation data came out this week. Consumer prices in the U.S. rose 0.3% from May, pushing the annual inflation rate to 2.7%, the highest since February. Core inflation (excluding food and energy) held steady at 2.9% year-over-year, in line with forecasts. That might sound mild, but it’s enough to keep the Fed cautious. Some categories, like household goods and electronics, saw sharp price jumps, likely reflecting new tariffs. The takeaway is that rate cuts are still likely, but probably not before September. Bitcoin reacted with a quick drop but steadied itself. #5 ₹1,500 Cr in XRP Moved Before WazirX Hack – Coinpedia Investigates A viral tweet from anonymous user @TOOFAANARMY is raising eyebrows: over ₹1,500 crore worth of XRP was moved from a WazirX-linked wallet just before the platform’s ₹2,000 crore hack. WazirX CEO Nischal Shetty tells Coinpedia it was routine user activity and cold wallet consolidation, not unusual. “We don’t have an account with Binance,” he added, pushing back on claims of direct transfers. The wallet was public on their Proof of Reserves page. For now, the claim remains unverified. #6 Grayscale Starts Process to Go Public The crypto investment firm has filed a confidential draft registration with the U.S. SEC, signaling plans for an IPO. For now, details like the number of shares and pricing are still undecided. The move won’t go forward until the SEC review is complete and market conditions are right. By choosing a confidential filing, Grayscale keeps its early plans private while testing investor interest behind the scenes. If the IPO goes ahead, it could help the company reach more investors and grow its role in traditional finance. #7 Crypto Market Cap Nears $4T, Chasing Nvidia Crypto had a massive day on Friday! The total market cap inched close to $4 trillion, driven by sharp gains in Ethereum and XRP after the U.S. House passed three major crypto bills.

The U.S is making fast decisions, Ripple vs SEC is back to make headlines, and fresh momentum built around some of the industry’s biggest tokens. There’s policy, price action, and just enough controversy to keep things interesting. If you missed anything, don’t worry – I’ve put the key updates in one place. Let’s dive in. #1 Gamechanger for Crypto? GENIUS Act Is Now Official It’s official: the U.S. just passed its first real stablecoin law. The GENIUS Act, a long-awaited bill to regulate dollar-backed stablecoins, was signed into law by President Trump after clearing the House with bipartisan support (308-122). The new rules require stablecoins to be backed by liquid assets like U.S. dollars and short-term Treasuries, with monthly public reserve disclosures. Trump called it “a giant step to cement the American dominance of global finance and crypto technology.” It’s the clearest signal yet that stablecoins are going mainstream; now with rules to match. #2 Trump to Allow 401(k) Investments in Crypto, Gold, and Private Equity Donald Trump is preparing to open up America’s $9 trillion retirement savings market to crypto, gold, and private equity.

2025-07-19 13:00:24+00:00,Bitcoin Advocate To Replace Cops With His Own Security In Bedford,"Bitcoin podcaster and Real Bedford FC owner Peter McCormack is taking matters into his own hands in his hometown of Bedford, UK. With rising concerns over public safety, McCormack says he’s stepping up where the police have fallen short — by paying for a group of private security guards to patrol the streets every Saturday. The town, home to around 185,800 people and located under two hours from London, has seen an increase in what McCormack calls “aggressive beggars,” shoplifting, and harassment. “The police have failed us,” he said in a post on X. “More crackheads, more aggressive beggars, more shoplifters, and therefore fewer people coming into town.” Security Teams To Patrol On Saturdays McCormack said he warned Bedford police before announcing the plan. Now, he’s personally funding a pilot program that sends 10 guards to monitor the town center every Saturday. According to him, this is all about making the streets safer for women, children, and families who no longer feel comfortable going out. Announcing my private security pilot for Bedford Town Centre – – – – – – – – – – – Starting this August, I’m personally funding a pilot project to provide private security in Bedford. Every Saturday, 10 guards will patrol the town centre and oversee safe parking at Lurke… — Peter McCormack (@PeterMcCormack) July 18, 2025 It’s not yet clear how far these guards can go in stopping crime. In the UK, taking justice into your own hands isn’t just frowned upon — it could be illegal. According to law experts at JD Spicer Zeb Solicitors, vigilantism is against the law. So while McCormack’s plan might sound bold, the details of how it will work within legal limits are still uncertain. Community Support And Football Backing McCormack isn’t just a podcast personality — he’s a visible figure in the town’s business and sports scene. He owns several businesses in Bedford and also runs Real Bedford FC, a club often referred to as the “ Bitcoin soccer team.” That nickname comes from the backing of Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the co-founders of Gemini, who have invested in the team. To build momentum behind his crime-fighting effort, McCormack said he surveyed locals and is organizing a community meeting. He wants residents to get involved and share their experiences and ideas for making Bedford safer. Private Security Fills Gaps In Other Cities Bedford isn’t the only place looking outside traditional police forces. In San Francisco, Lieutenant Eric J. Altorfer of the city’s police department said private security is increasingly stepping in to handle public safety, especially as law enforcement struggles with staffing issues. “Private security is already playing a crucial role,” Altorfer said in May. But he stressed that for it to work, there has to be coordination between private firms and police — not conflict. As McCormack’s plan moves forward, the focus will be on how the guards are trained, how they operate, and whether they work alongside the police or against them. For now, Bedford has a Bitcoin-backed football club owner willing to spend money to make the streets safer — whether the law sees it the same way is a question still hanging in the air.

2025-07-19 13:00:32+00:00,Will Bitcoin Impede Or Support Altcoin Rally? On-Chain Data Signals Market Uncertainty,"According to an on-chain analyst on X, Bitcoin has decoupled from other cryptocurrencies or altcoins, which could lead to a severe price downturn within the market over the next day. Why Traders Should Brace For Impact In a July 18 post on the social media platform X, Joao Wedson, founder of crypto analytics firm Alphractal, reported that the Bitcoin price might witness a significant drop over the next day. The crypto analyst based his conclusion on multiple results obtained from on-chain analysis using three major metrics. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trades Above $117K as Whale Deposits Decline and Stablecoin Inflows Rise First, Wedson referenced an earlier post made on X by Alphractal, saying that the market is currently dominated by long positions. According to the analyst, the effect of these long positions wouldn’t necessarily last long in a market where the shorts have been liquidated — a phenomenon which also holds for the reverse case. The chart above is from the Correlation Heatmap – BTCUSDT versus ALTCOINS metric, which reads the trajectory of the two crypto categories and compares them. Using the chart as a foundation, Wedson mentioned that altcoins are decoupling from Bitcoin. When altcoins cease to follow the premier cryptocurrency’s lead, the development could be subject to a couple of interpretations, which affect market sentiment. As a result, it is normal to expect increased market volatility. Wedson also referenced the Altcoin Season Index Vs Bitcoin metric, which is used to measure if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin within a specific period. According to the analyst, this Altcoin Season Index is currently on the rise, which is typically a positive sign for the altcoins. However, if historical trends are anything to go by, a rising Altcoin Season Index might be a negative signal for Bitcoin. Wedson explained that the Bitcoin market might experience a dump, dragging along with it the currently rising Altcoins, to re-establish market balance. The crypto pundit also cited the Alpha Quant Signal as an influence in his conclusion. Wedson pointed out that the metric flashed a sell, which was expected, seeing as some significant whales recently added to the sell pressure on Bitcoin by selling a fraction of their holdings. Outlook For The Altcoins Even as the market flashes ominous signs, Joao Wedson expressed optimism in the viability of the beginning of an altcoin rally, saying he doesn’t believe this is the final leg down for the crypto market. “But it’s likely a sign that the market is about to form a new price base. So be cautious with the traps that might show up along the way,” the analyst added.

2025-07-19 13:03:34+00:00,AVAX/BTC Pair Signals Strong Rally For AVAX Price,"The post AVAX/BTC Pair Signals Strong Rally For AVAX Price appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Avalanche price (AVAX) has broken out of a multi-month descending channel in July which caught the attention of many traders and could result in a strong move ahead. The AVAX price has been trading in a bear market since December 2023, although the current strength suggests an impressive change in the technical structure. Should those external conditions remain supportive, the move could provide a backdrop for a broader rally if momentum holds, the more so as analysts forecast higher AVAX price targets in the coming weeks. Breakout from Channel Ignites Bullish Sentiment In Avalanche The break above the descending channel is a key technical upside development for AVAX price action here in 2025. Analyst Ali Martinez echoed a similar sentiment, explaining that traders could use the current momentum as a launchpad for higher momentum, if it reclaim some key levels first. In particular, a prolonged gain above the $26 mark would likely advance the positive setup and encourage fresh capital in the market. Avalanche $AVAX is approaching a major resistance at $26. A breakout here could open the door for a significant move! pic.twitter.com/eiNxgYpbbw — Ali (@ali_charts) July 19, 2025 This assessment is further echoed by Ted Pillows , too. He shared a technical chart identifying a converging declining wedge pattern. The breakout from this pattern has been clean, signaling a structural shift away from lower highs and compressed price action. According to Ted, this breakout opens up the possibility of a price advance into the $32 to $35 zone over the next one to two weeks, assuming the current trend remains intact. BTC Pair Breakout Reinforces Technical Shift In a separate observation, CryptoKaleo pointed to the AVAX/BTC trading pair, which has now broken above a long-standing resistance trendline which was active since 2021. This move carries significant implications because the AVAX price has struggled to outperform Bitcoin over the past few years, but this breakout flips everything. The current multi-year structure break has flipped its narrative from bearish to bullish, and this act as a secondary confirmation of the AVAX/USD pairs ongoing trend reversal. $AVAX / $BTC broke out of a resistance dating back to its 2021 highs. This is going to rip so hard. pic.twitter.com/fG1xOomb9p — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) July 18, 2025 Moreover, analyst Planfomo added to the optimistic tone, projecting a potential target of $47 should AVAX successfully break out and hold above the $26–$27 range. Though such targets remain conditional on sustained market strength, they do highlight the increasing confidence in AVAX crypto’s technical outlook across different analysts. On-Chain and Derivatives Metrics Signal Growing Confidence The broader market trends indicate that the bulls are coming back in full force. The funding rates and open interest data indicate traders are leaning toward bullish scenarios. An increase in the funding rate is usually associated with long traders while an increasing open interest also indicates increased participation.

The AVAX price has been trading in a bear market since December 2023, although the current strength suggests an impressive change in the technical structure. Should those external conditions remain supportive, the move could provide a backdrop for a broader rally if momentum holds, the more so as analysts forecast higher AVAX price targets in the coming weeks. Breakout from Channel Ignites Bullish Sentiment In Avalanche The break above the descending channel is a key technical upside development for AVAX price action here in 2025. Analyst Ali Martinez echoed a similar sentiment, explaining that traders could use the current momentum as a launchpad for higher momentum, if it reclaim some key levels first. In particular, a prolonged gain above the $26 mark would likely advance the positive setup and encourage fresh capital in the market. Avalanche $AVAX is approaching a major resistance at $26. A breakout here could open the door for a significant move! pic.twitter.com/eiNxgYpbbw — Ali (@ali_charts) July 19, 2025 This assessment is further echoed by Ted Pillows , too. He shared a technical chart identifying a converging declining wedge pattern. The breakout from this pattern has been clean, signaling a structural shift away from lower highs and compressed price action. According to Ted, this breakout opens up the possibility of a price advance into the $32 to $35 zone over the next one to two weeks, assuming the current trend remains intact. BTC Pair Breakout Reinforces Technical Shift In a separate observation, CryptoKaleo pointed to the AVAX/BTC trading pair, which has now broken above a long-standing resistance trendline which was active since 2021. This move carries significant implications because the AVAX price has struggled to outperform Bitcoin over the past few years, but this breakout flips everything. The current multi-year structure break has flipped its narrative from bearish to bullish, and this act as a secondary confirmation of the AVAX/USD pairs ongoing trend reversal. $AVAX / $BTC broke out of a resistance dating back to its 2021 highs. This is going to rip so hard. pic.twitter.com/fG1xOomb9p — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) July 18, 2025 Moreover, analyst Planfomo added to the optimistic tone, projecting a potential target of $47 should AVAX successfully break out and hold above the $26–$27 range. Though such targets remain conditional on sustained market strength, they do highlight the increasing confidence in AVAX crypto’s technical outlook across different analysts. On-Chain and Derivatives Metrics Signal Growing Confidence The broader market trends indicate that the bulls are coming back in full force. The funding rates and open interest data indicate traders are leaning toward bullish scenarios. An increase in the funding rate is usually associated with long traders while an increasing open interest also indicates increased participation. These indications in combination signal a short-term bullish bias in AVAX price."

(SCHW) is preparing to launch trading for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) as it aims to become a dominant player in digital asset custody for U.S. retail investors, according to CEO Rick Wurster. Speaking Friday on CNBC’s ""Money Movers"", Wurster said Schwab clients already have significant crypto exposure through exchange-traded products — accounting for more than 20% of the industry''s holdings in that segment — but many have expressed interest in keeping their actual tokens with Schwab, rather than at crypto-native platforms. Crypto still represents a small slice of Schwab’s business, Wurster said, with about $25 billion in digital assets held across $10.8 trillion in total client wealth. But he framed Schwab’s upcoming product launch as a potential inflection point. “Our clients want their crypto to sit alongside their stocks, bonds and cash — not off to the side on a different app,” he said. Schwab anticipates demand will accelerate once it introduces direct access to bitcoin and ether custody and trading. The comments came just hours before President Trump was scheduled to sign the GENIUS Act, legislation aimed at bolstering U.S. blockchain competitiveness. The policy backdrop could further incentivize large brokerages to expand their crypto offerings, especially as the regulatory environment shifts in favor of mainstream financial firms. When asked whether Schwab’s upcoming platform would compete with Coinbase, Wurster replied: “Absolutely.” He added that the company would welcome a scenario where clients migrate their crypto holdings away from other platforms and consolidate them under Schwab’s umbrella. While no timeline was provided, the announcement positions Schwab — already one of the largest brokerages in the U.S. — to become a major player in retail crypto access, particularly for older and higher-net-worth clients seeking integration with traditional portfolios. Shares of Charles Schwab Corp. closed at $95.80 on Friday, up 2.9% for the day. The stock opened at $95.70 and reached an intraday high of $97.50, matching its 52-week peak, before paring gains.

2025-07-19 13:50:35+00:00,Ripple Price Analysis: Is XRP About to Explode Above $4 This Week?,"XRP has finally broken out of months of consolidation, reclaiming critical levels against both USDT and BTC. This breakout comes as broader market sentiment shifts bullish, with Ethereum and Bitcoin also showing strong rallies. Volume and momentum are backing the move, but traders should stay alert for potential profit-taking or short-term pullbacks following such sharp advances. Ripple Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan XRP/USDT Analysis Against USDT, XRP has smashed through the long-standing $3.00 resistance zone, which had previously acted as a ceiling during several failed breakout attempts. The move was clean and impulsive, with the price now pushing toward the $4.00 psychological resistance level. This is the next major mark to watch, as it is likely a potential target for many buyers. The RSI is also sitting above 80, showing strong momentum, but also flashing caution for potential short-term overextension. Looking at the structure, XRP broke above the descending wedge that had capped price action for the past 6 months. This shift marks a clear change in market character. As long as the XRP price stays above the $3.00 region, buyers are in control. A deeper retracement into the breakout zone could offer a high-probability retest entry. Losing $3.00 again, however, would invalidate the breakout and suggest a return to the range. Source: TradingView XRP/BTC Analysis The XRP/BTC pair has surged impressively, breaking above the key 2,500 SAT high and the 200-day moving average located nearby. It is now testing the upper boundary of a major supply zone around 3,000 SAT. This level previously acted as a distribution zone several times during earlier rallies and has now become the battleground between buyers and profit-takers. The XRP price has also created a fair value gap just below the current price, which could act as a short-term support to help push the price through the 3,000 SAT zone. Moreover, the RSI is currently hovering around 88, suggesting overheated conditions that may lead to short-term cooling. If XRP holds above the 2,500 SAT region, the bullish structure remains intact, and continuation above the 3,000 SAT resistance band becomes likely. However, any rejection from 3,000 SAT could trigger a pullback to retest the 200-day moving average around 2500 SAT.

In his statement on social media, Wedson highlighted several technical signals and urged investors to be cautious about a possible bearish scenario. “After reviewing several charts today, the picture is still not completely clear. However, given the heavy open long positions in the market, the possibility of a significant decline in the coming hours is quite realistic,” Wedson said in a statement. The key points in Wedson''s assessment are as follows: Correlation Warning: A heatmap showing a breakdown in correlation between BTC and altcoins could be a sign of increased market volatility. According to Wedson, this type of divergence often precedes a volatility storm. Altcoin Season Index: Although the rising Altcoin Season Index is generally interpreted as a positive signal for altcoins, according to Wedson, BTC “does not like” this situation and can often intervene suddenly in the market during these processes. Alpha Quant Sell Signal: Wedson noted that the Alpha Quant algorithm recently issued a “sell” signal. He explained that this signal was anticipated due to selling pressure from some whales and a technically emerging downtrend. Related News: Unexpected Statement from Swiss Investment Giant Official: “Yes, Ethereum is Up A Lot, But This Altcoin Will Do Even Better” Joao Wedson stated that he doesn''t think the market is in its final stages, but that such movements could signal the formation of a new price base.

Recently, India’s leading exchanges have reported a sharp rise in interest from Indian family offices, amidst the ongoing global bull run. Bitcoin’s Rise Fuels Confidence The wealthy Indian investors are quietly shifting their money into digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The trend has shifted, especially after Trump’s return to the White House, which has boosted global crypto confidence. With Bitcoin hitting above $120K and giving 90% returns in a year, crypto is now looking a lot more attractive than gold, stocks or bonds. HNI Activity Spikes Across Top Crypto Platforms A recent report from Moneycontrol reveals that platforms like Mudrex saw HNI trading volumes rise by 30% in just one week, hitting the $10 million mark. CoinDCX’s average HNI trade size grew by around 25–30% in July. Between January and June, around 3,500 HNIs, family offices, and institutional investors accounted for nearly half of all trading on CoinDCX. Their average monthly spot trading volume now exceeds ₹50 lakh. A Clear Shift In Mindset Most wealthy investors are leaning toward blue-chip tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Tokens like Solana and XRP are also gaining traction. CoinSwitch co-founder Ashish Singhal notes that Indian HNIs are no longer just exploring crypto; they are diving in. The mindset has shifted from ‘Why crypto?’ to ‘How much and where to invest?’ Retail Investors Driving The Momentum Although HNI trades are growing, retail investors are driving the real momentum. Daily trading volumes have jumped sharply across major platforms. CoinSwitch saw a 3x jump in daily trading while CoinDCX’s daily volume rose 40% in July to $12.82 million. Mudrex saw spot trading jump by 102% and futures trading rise by 200% within just one week. Interestingly, over half of this came from meme coins like Doge, PEPE, and Shiba Inu, while the rest came from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and Ripple. ZebPay saw 60% of trades towards the buy side. Many retail investors are entering or returning to the market, expecting more gains, while some are cashing out profits. Major Obstacles But India’s high taxes and uncertain regulations are still major obstacles that are pushing retail investors away. Experts note that simpler rules and better tax policies could drive even more interest. Bitcoin’s explosive price rally sparked a lot of interest in India. Around $150–200 million was invested in just one week. Major activity took place between July 10–15, when Bitcoin crossed $116K.

2025-07-19 14:16:35+00:00,Tether drives crypto adoption across regions,"Tether USDT, the world’s most liquid stablecoin, has established itself as a powerhouse in the crypto arena. Recent data analytics indicate that USDT commands 73% of stablecoin activities. Data shared on X underscores USDT’s deep integ ration into the daily fl ow o f digital currency transactions worldwide. Stablecoins like USDT are digital tokens pegged to traditional currencies—most commonly the US dollar—allowing users to transfer, store, and receive value without exposure to the extreme volatility typical of cryptocurrencies. One hundred sixty-five million on-chain wallets are holding USDT. Millions more are estimated to have USDT in centralized exchanges. Active stablecoin wallets have grown by over 50% over the past 12 months, from 19.6 million to 30 million. A substantial growth can be credited to Tether, which remains the market leader in user adoption, reach, and trading activity. Tether drives crypto adoption across regions USDT is more than a digital dollar; it is a new financial tool for everyone worldwide. Tether estimates that consumption in Asia is particularly high, with USDT representing approximately 45% of global volume . Local banking in some areas may be less established, or some countries may see high currency volatility, in which case USDT could be a good solution. Tether’s sway also runs heavily into the world of crypto trading. According to data from major exchanges, 65% of all trades with stablecoins involve USDT. It is a base currency of more than 900 trading pairs, including those from the major centralized exchanges, such as KuCoin and MEXC, meaning that ASTA has the largest number of trading pairs available in the market. Pairs such as USDT/BTC and USDT/ETH are some of the most active in the world, responsible for over 35% of all trading volume worldwide. Tether faces scrutiny while shaping the stablecoin future As much as it is in a leadership position, Tether has not been scandal-free. USDT reserves have been criticized for opacity by critics and regulators. In 2021, the United States’ Commodity Futures Trading Commission agreed to settle with Tether after making similar claims about the backing of the currency, inviting renewed attention around the asset that is best known for being used to devalue the USD in Bitcoin markets. Tether has since made greater efforts to become more transparent. It currently issues quarterly attestation reports that independent firms audit. Tether reached an all-time high of total exposure in the US Treasuries, approaching $120 billion, including Treasuries’ indirect exposures from Money Market Funds and reverse repo agreements. That leaves it with a reserve of $5.6 billion to carry it into next year, and it’s hard to argue that it is not in robust financial health. Still, regulatory pressure is growing. In the United States, proposed legislation like the STABLE Act seeks to increase scrutiny of stablecoin issuers. But critics say that rather than acting as a Trojan horse for innovation, if not carefully crafted, those laws could stifle it or fail to consider the dynamics of decentralization or global usage, punishing major players like Tether more than smaller ones. Competitors such as Circle’s USDC and MakerDAO’s DAI have a smaller market share, but have continued to steal a chunk of the market. Neither, however, has approached Tether’s size, reach, or application as a trading tool. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Tether faces scrutiny while shaping the stablecoin future As much as it is in a leadership position, Tether has not been scandal-free. USDT reserves have been criticized for opacity by critics and regulators. In 2021, the United States’ Commodity Futures Trading Commission agreed to settle with Tether after making similar claims about the backing of the currency, inviting renewed attention around the asset that is best known for being used to devalue the USD in Bitcoin markets. Tether has since made greater efforts to become more transparent. It currently issues quarterly attestation reports that independent firms audit. Tether reached an all-time high of total exposure in the US Treasuries, approaching $120 billion, including Treasuries’ indirect exposures from Money Market Funds and reverse repo agreements. That leaves it with a reserve of $5.6 billion to carry it into next year, and it’s hard to argue that it is not in robust financial health. Still, regulatory pressure is growing. In the United States, proposed legislation like the STABLE Act seeks to increase scrutiny of stablecoin issuers. But critics say that rather than acting as a Trojan horse for innovation, if not carefully crafted, those laws could stifle it or fail to consider the dynamics of decentralization or global usage, punishing major players like Tether more than smaller ones. Competitors such as Circle’s USDC and MakerDAO’s DAI have a smaller market share, but have continued to steal a chunk of the market. Neither, however, has approached Tether’s size, reach, or application as a trading tool. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Over 50 firms have already adopted a similar BTC-focused treasury strategy. However, a new segment of companies is emerging, seeking not only crypto exposure but also aligning directly with Ethereum’s economic ecosystem. At first glance, the sharp price swings seen in Ethereum treasury stocks might look like speculative rollercoasters similar to meme coins. But the approaches taken by this initial wave of ETH treasury firms differ at a fundamental level. Inside the First ETH Treasury Wave According to Galaxy Digital, these firms are moving beyond hype-driven or passive crypto exposure and are instead actively using Ethereum as a productive reserve asset by staking for yield or leveraging advanced DeFi strategies. This approach sets them apart from Bitcoin treasury adopters, who often took a passive “digital gold” stance financed by leverage-heavy convertible debt. Meanwhile, ETH treasury companies like SharpLink, BitMine, Bit Digital, and GameSquare have chosen to fund their strategies with equity, thereby avoiding the structural vulnerabilities linked to debt obligations and looming maturities. Galaxy Digital also said that the capital held by these firms is actively deployed rather than sitting idle. Through ETH staking, they boost validator security and protocol stability across the network. In cases like GameSquare, treasury funds are also used for DeFi-native yield strategies, which support liquidity pools, lending platforms, and other essential Ethereum infrastructure. Despite the ongoing risks of dilution, smart contract exposure, and price swings, investors can use dilution impact assessments and premium-to-book valuations to gauge both the downside and potential income-based upside. This wave of ETH treasuries appears to be a more actively engaged and capital-efficient model. Firms Scale Ethereum Holdings This month, the Nasdaq-listed online tech firm SharpLink made a significant Ethereum acquisition and became the largest corporate holder of ETH to date. From July 7 to July 13, the company bought around 74,656 ETH at an average price of $2,852, which is roughly worth $213 million. With this purchase, SharpLink’s total Ethereum holdings have grown to approximately 280,706 ETH. Las Vegas-based BitMine Immersion Technologies raised $250 million via a private placement of 55.6 million shares at $4.50 each on June 30 to grow its Ethereum treasury. The raise added 81,380 ETH to its balance sheet and increased total holdings to 163,000 ETH while expanding its share count by 13x. New York-based Bit Digital raised $172 million in June after selling 280 BTC to build its Ethereum treasury under CEO Sam Tabar. By March 31, it held 24,434 ETH, out of which it staked 21,568 ETH with a 3.2% average yield in 2024, and completed its pivot to an ETH staking and treasury model. Texas-based GameSquare Holdings raised $8 million in July via a follow-on equity offering and partnered with Dialectic to launch an Ethereum treasury program targeting 8-14% yields. The company made its first crypto move by purchasing $5 million in ETH.

2025-07-19 14:30:09+00:00,Crypto Lawyer Argues GENIUS Act Sets The Stage For DeFi Expansion,"In a historic move for the digital asset industry, US President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on Friday, marking the first major federal legislation governing cryptocurrency. The bill, which passed the Senate last month and was approved by the House of Representatives on Thursday with bipartisan support, introduces a comprehensive framework for regulated stablecoins backed by the US dollar. The law is widely seen as a turning point for the crypto space, offering long-awaited legal clarity for stablecoin issuers and reinforcing the dollar’s role in the emerging digital economy. Industry leaders and lawmakers alike hailed the move as a major win for innovation and financial modernization. By encouraging the development of fully reserved, off-chain backed stablecoins, the GENIUS Act aims to provide a safe and transparent on-ramp for users and institutions alike. Experts believe the legislation will drive further adoption of dollar-based digital payments while laying the groundwork for on-chain financial infrastructure to flourish. With the regulatory green light now in place, many expect accelerated growth in the US crypto sector, starting with stablecoins but expanding far beyond. This marks a pivotal moment in America’s positioning as a global leader in digital finance. DeFi Stands To Benefit As GENIUS Act Unlocks On-Chain Growth Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at Variant Fund, a prominent crypto-focused venture capital firm, recently offered an insightful take on the implications of the GENIUS Act. While the legislation itself is not aimed at decentralized finance (DeFi), Chervinsky noted that its impact on DeFi could be substantial. “The GENIUS Act isn’t directly about DeFi — it regulates centralized stablecoins with full reserves off-chain,” he said. “But it is very good for DeFi — the more dollars and people there are onchain, the more need there will be for on-chain finance of all kinds.” This perspective highlights a broader trend: regulation that encourages safer, more transparent stablecoins could lead to an influx of capital and users into the crypto ecosystem. With more regulated digital dollars flowing on-chain, the infrastructure supporting lending, trading, and yield generation in DeFi stands to grow significantly. Chervinsky’s point about payments being “just a gateway” reinforces the idea that once users begin transacting on-chain with stablecoins, the leap into more advanced financial tools becomes much more natural. As Bitcoin hovers above $117,000 and Ethereum reclaims the $3,500 level, these legal developments are adding fuel to an already bullish environment. The coming weeks may prove decisive as both BTC and ETH test new levels, backed by increasing institutional interest and a favorable policy shift in Washington. Crypto Market Surges To Multi-Year Resistance The total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin (TOTAL2) has broken out sharply, climbing to $1.45 trillion on strong volume. This marks an 11.58% gain in the past week and brings the market to levels not seen since early 2024. The move confirms renewed interest in altcoins, particularly Ethereum, which has led the charge with a 131% rally since April. Price action on the weekly chart shows a clean break above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages ($1.13T and $987B), with bullish momentum accelerating. The 200-week moving average at $879 billion provided strong long-term support throughout the recent consolidation phase, setting the stage for this breakout. This rally now targets the next major resistance zone around the $1.6–$1.7 trillion mark, where the market last peaked before a sharp correction. Volume has surged, supporting the strength of the breakout and suggesting institutional inflows may be returning. If TOTAL2 can maintain this momentum, the altcoin market could see a broader rotation and rally. Still, investors should watch closely for potential profit-taking or retracements, especially near key resistance. A weekly close above $1.5 trillion would further solidify the bullish structure and open the door for new cycle highs across major altcoins.

2025-07-19 14:57:10+00:00,Russian government readies tougher rules for miners,"Russia is preparing to impose new restrictions on cryptocurrency miners, including stricter punishments for violating existing bans and illegal mining activities. One of the proposed measures will allow authorities to remotely disconnect crypto mining facilities from the grid during periods when demand for electricity is at its highest. Russian government readies tougher rules for miners The Ministry of Energy in Russia has been tasked to finalize regulations for those involved in the extraction of digital currencies, the Interfax news agency reported, following a recent meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers in Moscow. According to a report issued after the meeting chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, the updated rules include introducing greater liability for illegal connection to distribution networks, electricity theft, and violation of imposed mining bans. Furthermore, crypto miners will be added to a new category of consumers of lesser importance, for which the reliability of power supply is far from guaranteed. The energy ministry is now expected to develop “a mechanism for redistributing the released capacity when limiting mining activities in a region in order to connect socially significant consumers to the power grid,” the document detailed. Russia wants to unplug mining farms remotely The Russian government explained that the establishment of the new “fourth” consumer category actually means having the option to “introduce remote restrictions on consumption during peak loads and under threat of energy and capacity shortages.” Russia legalized cryptocurrency mining in 2024 to exploit its competitive advantages, such as cheap and abundant energy. But Moscow was caught unprepared for how quickly miners managed to turn energy surpluses into shortages, prompting Putin to comment: “We were happy we had electricity surpluses in some regions. But they began mining there … We had to make certain decisions.” Speaking at an economic forum this month, the Russian President justified the mining restrictions introduced in certain parts of the country that have been facing increasing power deficits as a result of the rapid growth of the mining industry. In the past few months, mining has been partially or fully banned in a dozen energy-deficient regions, from Siberia to the North Caucasus, and even in occupied Ukraine. Initial temporary restrictions have been expanded to 6-year prohibitions, in some cases. Among other proposals discussed at the government meeting is the idea to introduce mandatory labeling and certification for foreign mining equipment imported into the Russian Federation, the crypto news outlet Bits.media noted in a post on Friday. It comes after Deputy Energy Minister Petr Konyushenko unveiled that his department has joined forces with the Federal Tax Service and the Ministry of Digital Development to establish a special register for devices used for digital minting. In early July, the official stated: “The register will allow us to accurately identify consumers using electricity for mining needs.” The revised regulations must be submitted for government approval by the end of the current quarter. Then, federal and local authorities will begin their gradual implementation in regions with active restrictions on the mining of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Elsewhere, both companies and individual entrepreneurs are allowed to mine as long as they register with the tax authority, but less than a third of mining enterprises have done that. The registration is not mandatory for amateur miners burning less than 6,000 kWh monthly. Meanwhile, Russian law enforcement and other agencies have been busting illegal crypto farms across the country to limit financial losses for the state and utilities. In June, the Rosseti grid operator said it’s working with telecom companies to hunt down illegal miners by tracking their internet traffic.

2025-07-19 15:00:00+00:00,"State of Crypto: The Industry''s No Good, Very Bad Wait Actually Excellent Week","The ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,"" otherwise known as the GENIUS Act, is now the law of the land, after President Donald Trump signed the first major U.S. legislation following a week-long process to pass it and two other bills in the House of Representatives. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Stable tokens The narrative On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a crypto bill into law. This is the first time a major cryptocurrency bill has become law, and it likely is not the last. Why it matters For the first time, a major cryptocurrency bill has become law in the U.S. The GENIUS Act, which sets out to create a regulatory framework governing stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset like the U.S. dollar, kickstarts a process that will see the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulators become far more involved in the crypto sector. Breaking it down There was a bit of a false start. The House Rules Committee met Monday evening to debate the bills with key members of the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees ahead of a procedural vote, which the House held Tuesday. That procedural vote was expected to sail through, albeit on party-line votes. It did not. Members of the House Freedom Caucus voted against the procedural motion to open debate and threw a wrench into the House''s ""Crypto Week."" Later that evening, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that 11 of the holdouts had agreed to vote for the motion and the House reconvened on Wednesday to first vote to hold a redo on the other vote (this one passed mostly along party lines) and then to actually redo the other vote. Many of the 11 holdouts continued to hold out. Trump, in remarks made before signing the GENIUS Act on Friday, joked about this: ""I am so tired of making phone calls at 2, 3, 4 o''clock in the morning."" Still, after a record-breaking 9+ hour vote, the lawmakers did finally vote in favor of the move to debate, clearing the way to a final vote for the three bills on Thursday. Despite these hiccups, Congressman Bryan Steil noted that Crypto Week largely played out as planned, with three bills getting passed and one heading to the president''s desk. ""In the House, it feels like in the home stretch with the narrow majority, there''s final negotiations, final discussions,"" he said on CoinDesk TV Thursday ahead of the vote. ""But the good news is the play call that was made at the start of the week is the play call we''re executing today, which is passing GENIUS, putting that on the president''s desk for his signature into law.""

The ""Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act,"" otherwise known as the GENIUS Act, is now the law of the land, after President Donald Trump signed the first major U.S. legislation following a week-long process to pass it and two other bills in the House of Representatives. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. Stable tokens The narrative On Friday, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a crypto bill into law. This is the first time a major cryptocurrency bill has become law, and it likely is not the last. Why it matters For the first time, a major cryptocurrency bill has become law in the U.S. The GENIUS Act, which sets out to create a regulatory framework governing stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to another asset like the U.S. dollar, kickstarts a process that will see the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulators become far more involved in the crypto sector. Breaking it down There was a bit of a false start. The House Rules Committee met Monday evening to debate the bills with key members of the Financial Services and Agriculture Committees ahead of a procedural vote, which the House held Tuesday. That procedural vote was expected to sail through, albeit on party-line votes. It did not. Members of the House Freedom Caucus voted against the procedural motion to open debate and threw a wrench into the House''s ""Crypto Week."" Later that evening, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that 11 of the holdouts had agreed to vote for the motion and the House reconvened on Wednesday to first vote to hold a redo on the other vote (this one passed mostly along party lines) and then to actually redo the other vote. Many of the 11 holdouts continued to hold out. Trump, in remarks made before signing the GENIUS Act on Friday, joked about this: ""I am so tired of making phone calls at 2, 3, 4 o''clock in the morning."" Still, after a record-breaking 9+ hour vote, the lawmakers did finally vote in favor of the move to debate, clearing the way to a final vote for the three bills on Thursday. Despite these hiccups, Congressman Bryan Steil noted that Crypto Week largely played out as planned, with three bills getting passed and one heading to the president''s desk. ""In the House, it feels like in the home stretch with the narrow majority, there''s final negotiations, final discussions,"" he said on CoinDesk TV Thursday ahead of the vote. ""But the good news is the play call that was made at the start of the week is the play call we''re executing today, which is passing GENIUS, putting that on the president''s desk for his signature into law."" Moreover, while industry participants anticipated that maybe 30 or so Democrats would vote for the bills, the actual numbers dramatically surpassed this — 78 Democrats joined 216 Republicans in voting for Clarity and 102 Democrats/206 Republicans voted for GENIUS.

Key Takeaways: Bitcoin podcaster Peter McCormack is funding private security patrols in Bedford to address rising crime. McCormack cites police inaction and growing issues like harassment and shoplifting harming local businesses. Legal experts warn that vigilantism is illegal in the UK. Frustrated by what he calls the police’s failure to protect the community, McCormack is personally funding a pilot initiative deploying ten security guards to patrol the town center every Saturday. In a post on X , McCormack said, “If the police won’t keep the town safe for our women and children, I will.” Rising Crime in Bedford Sparks Business Closures McCormack said his concerns center on a surge in crime, including aggressive begging, shoplifting, and harassment, which he says have driven shoppers away, forced stores to close, and left families feeling unsafe. The Bedford-based entrepreneur and football club owner claims he issued a warning to local police before launching his plan, criticizing them for not addressing these issues. Bedford, a town of around 185,800 residents located less than two hours from London, has seen McCormack become a vocal advocate for community safety. Alongside his business ventures, he runs Real Bedford FC, a football club famously dubbed the “Bitcoin soccer team,” backed by investments from Gemini founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. McCormack has engaged local residents by surveying them about crime and has called for community meetings to build support for his security project.

Vigilantism is illegal in the UK, and experts from JD Spicer Zeb Solicitors caution that such efforts must stay within legal boundaries. It is suggested that the guards may function more as informants, gathering video evidence to assist police investigations, similar to the growing trend of traffic vigilantes in the country. While the concept of privately funded security patrols might seem unconventional, it reflects a broader trend in areas facing police shortages. Lieutenant Eric J. Altorfer of the San Francisco Police Department noted earlier this year that private security increasingly fills gaps left by understaffed law enforcement agencies. However, Altorfer emphasized the importance of clear collaboration between private security firms and public police to ensure accountability and effectiveness. Crypto Execs Hire Bodyguards Amid Influencer Kidnapping Concerns As reported, crypto executives are turning to personal security services as targeted kidnappings and ransom attempts continue to escalate, particularly in France. In May, private security firms such as Infinite Risks International, based in Amsterdam, reported a sharp increase in demand from crypto professionals seeking round-the-clock protection amid rising crypto kidnappings. The rise in inquiries came after a spate of violent attacks, including multiple kidnapping attempts that have alarmed both investors and law enforcement. In France, the father of a crypto millionaire was brutally attacked . And in New York, a tourist was tortured for over two weeks as kidnappers tried to extract his Bitcoin credentials.

2025-07-19 15:25:26+00:00,Ethereum at $30K? Tom Lee Says Corporate Treasuries Could Make It Happen,"Tom Lee is making bold calls again—this time, putting Ethereum in the spotlight. He says if companies follow MicroStrategy’s game plan and use their balance sheets to buy ETH with stock and debt, a $30,000 Ethereum isn''t just a dream—it’s a math equation. BitMine, SharpLink, and Bit Digital have already scooped up over 682,000 ETH , and they’re not done. BitMine alone wants to control 5% of Ethereum’s entire supply. In just a week, they reportedly bought more ETH than MicroStrategy did in its first Bitcoin round back in 2020. SharpLink, backed by ETH co-founder Joseph Lubin, boosted its SEC filing from $1B to $6B—clearly aiming to keep buying. Bit Digital sold stock and BTC to grab over 100,000 ETH. Lee’s point? MicroStrategy’s massive stock run—35x since 2020—wasn’t just about Bitcoin going up. Only about a third of it came from BTC’s rise. The rest? Their financial strategy. By issuing shares and taking on debt, they accelerated their BTC buys—and investors rewarded that with a skyrocketing stock price. Lee thinks Ethereum is even better suited for this playbook. Why? Because ETH’s volatility can actually help reduce borrowing costs. Plus, companies can use convertible notes and preferred shares to buy ETH without diluting shareholders too much. This creates what Lee calls a ""reflexive loop"": higher ETH buys push up the stock price, which lets companies raise more cash, to buy even more ETH , and so on. That speeds up price discovery—and compresses time. Unlike MicroStrategy, which took years, these ETH-heavy firms are moving billions in just weeks. ETH sits around $3,600 today.

Svenson tells his 83,500 YouTube subscribers that the relative strength index (RSI), a momentum oscillator used to determine overbought or oversold conditions, is flashing a signal on the daily time frame that has previously preceded massive rallies such as in October of 2023, February of 2024 and November of 2024. “Bitcoin’s daily RSI is attempting to bounce off of the overbought zone. Which, in my book, when you break out and you enter overbought, that is oftentimes can be a very bullish signal. Contrary to what most people would assume, they think that overbought is always bad.” Source: Kevin Svenson/X The RSI indicator is calibrated from zero to 100, with readings of zero to 30 indicating oversold conditions and readings of above 70 indicating overbought conditions. According to Svenson, Bitcoin could go up by nearly 20% from the current level in a few months to hit the cycle peak. “Bitcoin right now breaking above this resistance ($112,000) into the overbought zone. It usually signals major momentum… I’m aiming for something around $142,000 for this run. You know, that’s a multi-month target. I’m not saying it’s going to happen necessarily in a month. I think that’ll happen anywhere from, you know, a couple months to around October of this year… The Bitcoin halving cycle profit shows that 80 weeks after the halving is the usual start of the bear market, which in this cycle is going to be landing us around end of October.” Bitcoin is trading at $118,994 at time of writing.

In a new video , crypto analyst VirtualBacon breaks down what’s really happening, what’s driving the buzz, and where XRP could be headed next. XRP Beats Bitcoin in Online Searches He points out that XRP has now become the most searched crypto on both Google and YouTube, even more than Bitcoin and Ethereum. This shows a big jump in interest from the public. Many people are curious about what’s next for XRP, which could be a sign of growing momentum before a major move. According to crypto analyst Kyle Chassé, XRP is set for a major breakout. XRP has already outperformed Bitcoin by triple digits, without a US ETF, treasury adoption, or DeFi yield. What’s Brewing Inside? A recent report from the CME Group, a big name in traditional finance, gives XRP some serious credit. It confirms XRP’s price moves are just as active as other big cryptos like Ethereum and Solana, but what’s more important is that XRP doesn’t move in sync with Bitcoin or the stock market. That makes it stand out. For big investors looking for variety in their portfolios, XRP now looks more attractive. The report also touches on XRP’s controversial token supply. But according to the analyst, Ripple is following its plan to release tokens slowly over the next 10 to 13 years. As long as they stick to this, the supply won’t flood the market. This gives investors more confidence that XRP’s price won’t be dragged down by unexpected token releases. Can XRP Hit $10 This Year? However, Analyst gives a realistic price target of $4.50 to $5 by the end of this year, assuming Bitcoin hits $140K . He says this is very possible if XRP continues to gain attention and if Bitcoin starts its next big rally. As for $10, it’s not impossible, but it may only happen later in the cycle. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will XRP Price Hit $4 After Ripple vs SEC Officially Ends? , Why $20 XRP Is Unrealistic This Cycle While some XRP supporters dream of a $20 price tag, Analyst strongly warns against such expectations. He explains that during the 2017 bull run, when XRP reached its all-time high , there were far fewer competing altcoins in the market. Today, XRP faces competition from Solana, BNB, Cardano, AI, and gaming tokens, and even stablecoins. For XRP to reach $20, it would need to reclaim a 23% market dominance, the level it had in 2017. Given the explosion of crypto sectors and narratives, this is nearly impossible in today’s market structure. Overall he emphasizes that while a momentary kick to $20 during peak euphoria is possible, such a price wouldn’t be sustainable. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-19 16:00:16+00:00,SEC Chair Signals Openness To Including Crypto Investments In Retirement Plan — Details,"United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Paul Atkins has indicated openness to allow crypto investments in retirement plans. This comes days after a report emerged about United States President Donald Trump’s plans to open the retirement market to other alternative investments, including digital assets, gold, and private equity. This report revealed that the initiative is expected to become a reality through a Presidential executive order as early as this week. This move would allow the diversification of investment options available within US retirement 401(k) plans, which have been primarily limited to stocks and bonds over the years. Disclosure Still Important For Crypto Inclusion In 401(k) Plans A 401(k) plan is a workplace savings plan that allows an individual to contribute a portion of their wages to individual accounts where it can be invested and withdrawn at a future date — typically after retirement. In a Bloomberg interview on Friday, July 18, Atkins signaled openness to allowing cryptocurrencies into 401(k) plans for retired Americans. However, the Commission’s leader highlighted the need for responsible disclosure and education on risks associated with investing in digital assets. Atkins said about the move: We have to do it carefully, because the private markets are a lot different from the public markets. Disclosure is key, and people need to know what they are getting into. However, we need to address it because there is a demand out there for this sort of products. If Trump does sign an executive order allowing crypto investments in American retirement plans, it would represent another one in the host of pro-crypto actions taken by the US president since taking the Oval Office in January. On Friday, Trump signed the landmark crypto bill “GENIUS” into law. This GENIUS act represents a stride in the right direction for clearer regulations for the crypto industry, as the legislation is aimed at establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins. SEC Exploring Innovation Exception To Boost Tokenization In the interview, Atkins also mentioned that the SEC is considering setting up an innovation exemption within its regulatory framework to foster tokenization. As Bitcoinist earlier reported, this change would allow new trading techniques and support the development of a tokenized securities ecosystem. Atkins is becoming increasingly popular amongst the crypto crowd due to his pro-crypto stance, which is the stark opposite of his predecessor, Gary Gensler.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/sec-openness-to-including-crypto-in-retirement-plan/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK,Crypto News|bitcoin|crypto|crypto news|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|US President Donald Trump,BTC,"SEC Chair Signals Openness To Including Crypto Investments In Retirement Plan — Details.

2025-07-19 16:00:55+00:00,"Why Bitcoin Price Failed To Break $123,000 In The Past Week — Analyst Explains","The crypto market was a story of two distinct halves, one of which saw the Bitcoin price soar to multiple all-time highs. After reaching its all-time high of around $122,800, the premier cryptocurrency has succumbed to a sobering wave of bearish pressure in the past few days. This recent wave of downward pressure was precipitated by the movement of a Satoshi-era whale on Thursday, July 17. However, the Bitcoin price never seemed likely to cross the $123,000 level, and a prominent on-chain expert on X has explained why. Is The Move To $143,000 Still Possible? In a recent post on the social media platform X, Alphractal CEO & founder Joao Wedson explained why the price of BTC failed to break the $123,000 level during its rally to a new all-time high in the past week. According to the crypto expert, this seeming loss of momentum could spell danger for the market leader in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Long-Term Holders Sell As Short-Term Buyers Step In – Sign Of Rally Exhaustion? The rationale behind this prediction is that the $123,000 region (or more precisely, $123,370) is the second Alpha Price level for the Bitcoin price. For context, the Alpha Price is a powerful on-chain indicator that uses several key metrics to estimate where the BTC price is likely to find support or resistance. In essence, the Alpha Price is a level that the price of Bitcoin needs to breach and stay above to enter the next significant phase of the bull cycle. “It begins by calculating the market’s age in days and uses that to derive the average market cap—essentially the historical valuation baseline,” Wedson added about the indicator. As shown in the chart above, the Alpha Price indicator has multiple threshold levels, which behave like pressure regions. These thresholds reflect zones where investor sentiment is likely to shift; lower levels act as supports because investors often buy to defend their positions, while upper levels signal increased selling pressure due to profit taking. Wedson noted that the Bitcoin price failing to breach the second Alpha Price level doesn’t imply that the market top is in. However, the $123,370 region is a clear resistance zone, and the BTC price might need to face some pullback before climbing to new highs. Wedson also mentioned that the Alpha Price level will update on Saturday, July 19, as it’s dynamically adjusted based on real-time on-chain transaction flows. Nevertheless, if the Bitcoin price does break this level, a move to above $143,000 could still be on the cards. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $117,610, reflecting an over 2% decline in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Whales?

2025-07-19 16:30:44+00:00,"Pundit to XRP Holders: When BlackRock Comes in, You Will Be Glad You Have 1 XRP","Bale (@AltcoinBale), a crypto pundit on X, recently addressed the XRP Army, stating that all XRP holders, including those holding only 1 XRP, will be glad when BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, gets involved with the digital asset. The comment alludes to the growing anticipation that institutional finance giants will soon recognize XRP’s utility and position in global finance. Many retail investors have accumulated XRP with expectations that its price will one day reflect the real-world use cases it enables. However, the notion that even holding one XRP might eventually be significant shows a belief in extreme long-term appreciation, potentially driven by institutional adoption. If you hold 1 XRP or 1,000 XRP Understand that you understand what XRP is. When Blackrock come in, you will be glad you have 1 XRP — BALE (@AltcoinBale) July 19, 2025 Institutional Entry Could Signal a Turning Point Bale’s post plays into a broader conversation among XRP supporters who believe that traditional finance is quietly preparing to integrate XRP into future infrastructure. Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently predicted that XRP is on the cusp of mass institutional adoption , and BlackRock’s involvement with Bitcoin through ETFs shows that the firm is interested in cryptocurrencies. Its entrance into the XRP market would signal institutional validation that could change the market landscape entirely. Such involvement would carry more than just symbolic weight, as BlackRock manages trillions in assets. Anticipation for a BlackRock XRP ETF has been building for years, and such a product would introduce XRP to a wider investor base, bring major capital inflows, boost liquidity, and give the asset a level of credibility retail investors cannot provide on their own. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Holding At Least 1 XRP Is Important Prominent voices in the crypto space, such as Edoardo Farina, have constantly advised investors to hold up to 10,000 XRP. He opined that the amount may soon be impossible for average investors . However, Bale suggests that holding just one token could be life-changing. A growing number of XRP advocates believe that in a future where demand for XRP surges, individual holders could lend out their tokens to institutions , generating passive income from them. XRP has a fixed supply. As more tokens are burned and supply diminishes, the asset will become more valuable. As the supply shrinks, institutions that need to use the asset will have to depend on retail investors who purchased early. If a player like BlackRock does enter, Bale’s post may age well, and even the smallest holders could find themselves in a strong position.

Bale (@AltcoinBale), a crypto pundit on X, recently addressed the XRP Army, stating that all XRP holders, including those holding only 1 XRP, will be glad when BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, gets involved with the digital asset. The comment alludes to the growing anticipation that institutional finance giants will soon recognize XRP’s utility and position in global finance. Many retail investors have accumulated XRP with expectations that its price will one day reflect the real-world use cases it enables. However, the notion that even holding one XRP might eventually be significant shows a belief in extreme long-term appreciation, potentially driven by institutional adoption. If you hold 1 XRP or 1,000 XRP Understand that you understand what XRP is. When Blackrock come in, you will be glad you have 1 XRP — BALE (@AltcoinBale) July 19, 2025 Institutional Entry Could Signal a Turning Point Bale’s post plays into a broader conversation among XRP supporters who believe that traditional finance is quietly preparing to integrate XRP into future infrastructure. Ripple CTO David Schwartz recently predicted that XRP is on the cusp of mass institutional adoption , and BlackRock’s involvement with Bitcoin through ETFs shows that the firm is interested in cryptocurrencies. Its entrance into the XRP market would signal institutional validation that could change the market landscape entirely. Such involvement would carry more than just symbolic weight, as BlackRock manages trillions in assets. Anticipation for a BlackRock XRP ETF has been building for years, and such a product would introduce XRP to a wider investor base, bring major capital inflows, boost liquidity, and give the asset a level of credibility retail investors cannot provide on their own. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why Holding At Least 1 XRP Is Important Prominent voices in the crypto space, such as Edoardo Farina, have constantly advised investors to hold up to 10,000 XRP. He opined that the amount may soon be impossible for average investors . However, Bale suggests that holding just one token could be life-changing. A growing number of XRP advocates believe that in a future where demand for XRP surges, individual holders could lend out their tokens to institutions , generating passive income from them. XRP has a fixed supply. As more tokens are burned and supply diminishes, the asset will become more valuable. As the supply shrinks, institutions that need to use the asset will have to depend on retail investors who purchased early. If a player like BlackRock does enter, Bale’s post may age well, and even the smallest holders could find themselves in a strong position.

Authorities say Zin Nwe Nyunt of Singapore set up a wholesale trading firm, and after the company’s accounts received SGD $640.7 million – about $500 million – she stated she had no idea where it came from, The Straits Times reports . Her trading firm, called Unione Pte Ltd, set up bank accounts with Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), United Overseas Bank (UOB) and DBS. She then received large sums of money via wire transfer between 2020 and 2021, court proceedings show. Nyunt first hit the police’s radar when an Australian investment scam victim provided information that led investigators to Unione’s bank account in 2021, which received $1.8 million in proceeds from the scheme. Court proceedings revealed a friend of Nyunt’s husband, Nyan Win, was approached by a Myanmar national named Ko Phillip, who asked him if he wanted to assist him in his commodities trading business by receiving wire transfers to a Singaporean business account. The deal was that Win would be paid 0.5 Myanmar kyat – a small fraction of a cent – for every US$1 received. However, Win decided it was too risky for him to receive money to his company’s bank account, and instead referred the alleged “opportunity” to Nyunt’s husband. In what appears to be an elaborate money laundering operation for scams, neither Nyunt nor Nyan were ever aware of the source of the funds, but each admitted to receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in “commissions.” Nyunt will begin serving an 18 month prison sentence in August while Nyan is expected to be sentenced at the end of this month.

2025-07-19 16:59:00+00:00,"Grok AI Predicts When Dogecoin Hits $1, Shiba Inu Hits $0.0001, and This New Meme Coin Hits $3","Grok AI has released bold new forecasts shaking up the market outlook. Dogecoin is projected to reach the $1 milestone, Shiba Inu to hit $0.0001, and newcomer Little Pepe to reach $3. However, the timeline is even more shocking. After selling out Stage 4 ahead of schedule, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has entered Stage 5 at a price of $0.0014, marking a 40% rise from its Stage 1 price. Current buyers are already positioned for a 2.14x return, with a confirmed listing at $0.003. However, Grok AI’s full projection reveals much more than a simple double, it anticipates Little Pepe (LILPEPE) reaching $3 by Q2 2026. That is a staggering 2,042x gain from today’s price, outperforming many of the top assets in circulation. Backed by over $5.8 million raised and more than 4.9 billion tokens sold in record time, the project’s acceleration isn’t slowing down. Grok AI’s Forecast: Where Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Are Headed According to Grok AI’s latest projections, Dogecoin is expected to reach $1 by April 2026, a nearly 5x increase from its current price of $0.20. This trajectory is supported by steady adoption, integration with payment systems, and potential market-wide momentum following anticipated Bitcoin surges. Shiba Inu, currently trading at $0.0000134, is forecasted to hit $0.0001 by late 2025, marking a projected 7.5x return. While both tokens have strong community backing, Grok’s data suggests Dogecoin’s growth may be more short-term event-driven, while Shiba Inu’s path depends more on ecosystem expansion like Shibarium. These predictions also provide a performance benchmark for newer entrants such as Little Pepe (LILPEPE), which Grok forecasts could reach $3, far surpassing both in relative ROI. Stage 4 Sells Out Quickly as $5.9 M Raised Momentum continues to build around Little Pepe (LILPEPE), with Stage 4 of the presale completely selling out. Over 4.8 billion tokens were snapped up, bringing in $5.9 million. With that phase now closed, the price has moved up to $0.0014 in Stage 5. The strong response highlights growing belief in the project and where it’s headed next. Audit Score of 81.55 and CoinMarketCap Listing Boost Credibility Little Pepe (LILPEPE) has undergone a full audit by Freshcoins.io, receiving a solid score of 81.55. This third-party validation adds an extra layer of trust for those just discovering the project. It’s also now listed on CoinMarketCap, giving it greater visibility and showing that LILPEPE is hitting key development milestones. Layer 2 Built for Speed and Simplicity The team behind Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is launching its own Layer 2 blockchain. It’s designed for quick, low-cost transactions and an overall smoother user and developer experience. This approach aims to solve the performance issues seen on many older networks. $777,000 Giveaway Now Live A massive giveaway is now underway, with $777,000 in prizes.

An audit score of 81.55, a CoinMarketCap listing, and its upcoming Layer 2 blockchain are building serious credibility and momentum. According to Grok AI, Dogecoin is on track to reach $1 by April 2026, while Shiba Inu could hit $0.0001 before the end of 2025.

2025-07-19 17:00:56+00:00,2 cryptocurrencies to buy now for your retirement portfolio,"Although the cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, several assets are increasingly showing potential for inclusion in long-term retirement portfolios. Notably, with the U.S. advancing regulation through laws like the Genius Act, the case for crypto as a legitimate investment class is gaining traction. To this end, and beyond leading names like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ), Finbold has identified the following altcoins worth considering for your retirement portfolio. Solana (SOL) Solana has matured significantly in recent years, following a near collapse in 2022 due to its ties to the FTX saga. Notably, Solana earns a place in the portfolio thanks to its ability to process thousands of transactions per second, making it ideal for decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming applications. The ecosystem is also expanding, with the potential to attract institutional investors, especially with a possible spot ETF on the horizon. Solana’s architecture also appeals to developers migrating from congested and costly Ethereum chains, giving it strong forward momentum. Previously, Solana surged from $0.22 in 2020 to over $200 at its peak and has undergone upgrades aimed at improving the network. Analysts, such as VanEck, project that its price could exceed $3,200 by 2030, making it an ideal investment option.

Built on its unique Hashgraph consensus, a faster, more energy-efficient alternative to traditional blockchain, Hedera can process over 10,000 transactions per second with near-instant finality. What sets HBAR apart is its governance council, composed of industry giants such as Google, IBM, LG, and Deutsche Telekom. These stakeholders not only validate the network but also build on it, demonstrating rare institutional confidence in a crypto project. Use cases include tokenization, identity verification, carbon tracking, and supply chain solutions, offering solid potential for long-term growth.

In the last 24-hour period, AVAX’s price dipped around 0.5% to $23.63, but moving the timeline to 30 days shows a major 30.3% rise, slightly outperforming the wider crypto market as measured by the CoinDesk 20 ( CD20 ) index, which rose 30.1%. During the rise, AVAX’s volatility was accompanied by above-average volume, according to CoinDesk Research''s technical analysis model. This kind of price action, where buyers step in quickly at key levels, suggests a growing confidence among traders. The token has recently exited a multi-month descending channel, a technical pattern many traders interpret as a bullish reversal. Some market analysts, including OKX-partnered trader Ted Pillows, have floated $32 to $35 as a possible short-term target, citing improved sentiment and chart structure. Per Pillows, the “AVAX breakout has finally happened.” AVAX’s steady climb also comes amid a broader rebound in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity.

The data visualizes how MicroStrategy’s famous Bitcoin purchases would have performed had Michael Saylor, the company’s executive chairman, chosen XRP instead. According to the post, “Michael Saylor would be up 2X today if he bought XRP instead of Bitcoin.” Michael Saylor would be up 2X today if he bought XRP instead of Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/g5D9t1ukK4 — Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) July 19, 2025 Chart Shows XRP Outpacing Bitcoin by 2025 The chart illustrates portfolio performance starting from August 2020 through July 2025. Both the Bitcoin and XRP portfolios initially tracked each other closely through late 2021, showing modest gains with some fluctuations. From December 2023 onwards, however, the XRP portfolio began to outperform Bitcoin significantly. Around September 2024, XRP’s cumulative value visibly exceeded Bitcoin’s and maintained its lead through to July 2025. By the end of the charted period, XRP’s hypothetical value crossed $140 billion while Bitcoin’s hovered near $70 billion. Gordon Emphasizes Missed Opportunity Gordon framed this as evidence that XRP would have yielded double the gains compared to Bitcoin over the same period. The data implies that the decision to focus solely on Bitcoin came at the expense of greater returns that could have been realized with XRP . Gordon presented the comparison as a hypothetical scenario, highlighting what he described as a missed opportunity for MicroStrategy’s treasury strategy. Responses Defend Bitcoin’s Long-Term Appeal In response to Gordon’s post , users on the platform weighed in with differing views. One user argued that the comparison overlooks Bitcoin’s unique properties. They stated that short-term gains do not outweigh long-term fundamentals, suggesting that Saylor’s choice of Bitcoin stemmed from his recognition of it as “the apex digital commodity” and a position unmatched by any other cryptocurrency. This user also highlighted Bitcoin’s network effects and institutional adoption as key factors behind Saylor’s investment thesis.

According to this perspective, Bitcoin represents a long-term bet on a future where fiat currencies decline and monetary sovereignty becomes more important. The same user emphasized that Saylor’s intent was not to pursue short-term gains but rather to align with what they described as a rewriting of monetary history. Gordon’s tweet and the attached chart focused primarily on cumulative portfolio performance, measuring the returns of each asset over nearly five years. The comparison underscored XRP’s more recent appreciation, particularly from late 2023 onwards, where its growth accelerated relative to Bitcoin. The chart clearly visualized a sharp divergence between the two portfolios as XRP climbed rapidly, while Bitcoin’s growth remained steady but comparatively subdued. Overall, the post by Gordon asserted that Saylor could have doubled MicroStrategy’s portfolio value had he opted for XRP instead of Bitcoin. However, several respondents contended that the choice of Bitcoin reflects a long-term strategy centered on digital scarcity and foundational strength, rather than short-term market performance.

2025-07-19 17:30:17+00:00,Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Price Crash: Rejection From $120K Puts Altcoins At Risk,"Bitcoin’s price action has turned somewhat sluggish after its unprecedented climb to a new all-time high of $122,838 on July 14. The rapid push to that level was preceded by a week of frenzied trading and heavy inflows, with BTC breaking through multiple resistance zones in quick succession. However, once that peak was hit, a series of volatile intraday movements followed to give a pullback to $116,000 and Bitcoin is now back to trading between the $117,000 and $118,500 price zone. Related Reading: If You’re Wealthy, 1 Bitcoin Should Already Be In Your Wallet, Expert Says A notable bearish call came from crypto analyst Melikatrader94, who posted a technical breakdown on the TradingView platform that might send Bitcoin down to $113,000. QML Zone Rejection Points To Downtrend Toward $113,600 According to the hourly candlestick chart shared by Melikatrader94, Bitcoin is currently exhibiting a Quasimodo Level (QML) structure. The Quasimodo Level (QML) structure is characterized by three peaks in a bearish scenario or three troughs in a bullish scenario, with the middle one being the most prominent, identifying the price. The post predicted that Bitcoin’s entry into the $119,000–$121,000 zone would draw sellers, and this was indeed the case. The quick rejection after its all-time high confirms a bearish shift in structure, and now the momentum is tilted to the downside. This rejection came after a significant price move that engulfed a previous structural support level. “BTC rejected from QML zone and the selloff confirms bears are active,” the analyst noted. The bearish outlook remains valid as long as Bitcoin stays below the QML zone, with the next critical support level situated at $113,600. This area could serve as a potential point for either a bounce or short-term consolidation if the price continues downward. However, a pullback is likely to occur around $116,000 before Bitcoin falls to $113,600. Altcoins Under Threat As BTC Price Weakens The potential Bitcoin crash to the $113,000 region could have serious implications for many altcoins that are already starting to post massive gains. However, these altcoins, which often follow Bitcoin’s lead, are already showing signs of nervousness as BTC struggles to maintain upward momentum. Among the notable movers, XRP finally broke its eight-year-old resistance to hit a new all-time high of $3.65. However, the rally appears to be stalling, with the token now showing early signs of a correction around the $3.45 zone. Ethereum, which also surged on the back of Bitcoin’s push to $122,000, climbed above $3,600 for the first time in months but has since settled into a consolidation phase just below $3,500.

2025-07-19 17:30:26+00:00,"Today In Crypto: 3 Major Bills Passed In The US House, Here’s What You Should Know","The US House of Representatives passed three significant pieces of legislation this week, hallmarking what many in the crypto industry are calling the most impactful week for crypto policy in recent memory. The bills are meant to target the crypto market structure, stablecoin regulation, and a preemptive block against a digital dollar. Although each addresses a different segment of the crypto ecosystem, they collectively point to an improving sentiment among lawmakers regarding the growing crypto industry. House Passes CLARITY, GENIUS, And Anti-CBDC Bills First, the House gave a resounding green light to the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, which passed with a bipartisan vote of 294–134. The bill was created to define how cryptocurrencies should be classified, either as securities under the SEC or as commodities under the CFTC. The passage of this bill marks a major milestone in the effort to bring regulatory clarity to both investors and innovators, something that has long eluded the US crypto sector. Despite receiving support from nearly 80 Democrats, the bill was not without opposition. Critics like Representative Maxine Waters argued that the legislation could allow harmful loopholes that weaken protections for retail investors. Meanwhile, the GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act sailed through the legislative chamber with even bigger support. Having already cleared the Senate in June with a 68–30 vote, the House added its stamp of approval with a 308–122 result. The GENIUS Act sets strict guardrails around stablecoins, mandating that issuers fully back their tokens with reserves, undergo monthly audits, and comply with key anti-money laundering and consumer protection frameworks. Its quick passage culminated in President Trump signing it into law on July 18, making it the first major federal regulation specifically tailored to digital assets. Rounding out the trio of bills is the controversial Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which passed by a narrower margin of 219–210. This bill proposes to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a central bank digital currency. Supporters of the bill argue that a digital dollar would increase state surveillance over user finances. On the other hand, the legislation reduces the Fed’s ability to respond to global trends in central banking, particularly as countries like China continue advancing their own CBDCs . What Comes Next? As it stands, the GENIUS Act regulating stablecoins is already in effect. However, the CLARITY Act and Anti-CBDC bill will now move to the Senate, where their fate is less certain. Interestingly, the voting dynamics in the House of Representatives show that many Democratic lawmakers are positive about the crypto market. Over 100 Democrats voted positively for the GENIUS Act, while 78 supported the CLARITY Act. The Senate is expected to scrutinize the two remaining bills more closely when it reconvenes. However, there is a high chance both bills will be passed without hiccups. Market reaction to the news has been somewhat mixed . Bitcoin continues to trade steadily just above $118,000.

In the report, the IMF stated that “the overall stock of Bitcoin held by the public sector has remained unchanged since program approval.” This statement debunks El Salvador’s claims of purchasing 1 BTC every single day. The IMF explained that the perceived increase in El Salvador’s public Bitcoin reserves was due to internal transfers and wallet consolidations among government-controlled wallets. More specifically, the BTC movements occurred between the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund and the Chivo e‑wallet. The IMF report included a footnote that says, “Increases in Bitcoin holdings in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund reflect the consolidation of Bitcoin across various government‑owned wallets.” The report, however, noted minor fluctuations in Chivo wallet balances due to client deposit activity. These were not the result of new public BTC purchases. As part of its $1.4 billion Extended Fund Facility agreement, the IMF explicitly required El Salvador to halt new Bitcoin purchases. Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, took to X on March 4 and said , “No, it’s not stopping. If it didn’t stop when the world ostracized us and most ‘bitcoiners’ abandoned us, it won’t stop now, and it won’t stop in the future. Proof of work > proof of whining.” The rhetoric of the Salvadoran government is mostly showmanship, but its actions align with the IMF’s demands.

Bitcoin City stalled, other projects halted At the end of 2021, Nayib Bukele announced his plan to build a Bitcoin City in the southeastern region of La Unión. Bukele promised zero income tax, zero property tax, no procurement tax, zero city tax, and zero CO₂ emissions. After almost four years, Bitcoin City remains a proposal, and no construction has commenced. Volcano Bonds, another project that promised the issuance of a $1 billion Bitcoin bond, was indefinitely postponed in March 2022. The delayed issuance of the “Volcano Bonds” was tied to global market volatility and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. At the time, the country’s Finance Minister, Alejandro Zelaya, said on local TV, “We believe that between March 15 and 20 is the right timing, we have the tools almost finished. But the international context will tell us … I didn’t expect the war in Ukraine.” The LaGeo crypto mining facility, a state-owned geothermal Bitcoin mining initiative, was announced in June 2021. Bukele proposed a plan to use 100% clean, volcano-powered geothermal energy to mine Bitcoin. He even shared a video of a Bitcoin mining facility using volcanic power. As of 2025, the mining project is reportedly inactive. Other projects, like El Salvador’s Bitcoin-funded Chivo Pets hospital , were completely halted in March.

2025-07-19 18:45:39+00:00,"Google Takes Legal Action Against ‘BadBox 2.0’ Botnet That Compromised More Than 10,000,000 Devices","Tech giant Google is taking legal action against a Botnet that exploited over 10 million Internet-of-Things (IoT) Android devices. In a new blog post , Google is announcing that it has filed a lawsuit in a New York federal court against BadBox 2.0 – the largest botnet of IoT television devices in the world – after it was discovered by its cybersecurity experts. According to Google, BadBox 2.0 compromised over 10 million uncertified devices running the Android open source operating system and installed malware to “conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.” The original BadBox went down in 2023. BadBox 2.0 came into operation the following year and has been running since. The tech giant says that it has already taken action to stop the threat, updating its security measures to automatically block all applications associated with the malicious botnet. In a recent blog post, the cybersecurity firm HUMAN – a partner of Google – explains how BadBox 2.0 operates. “BADBOX 2.0, like its predecessor, begins with backdoors on low-cost consumer devices that enable threat actors to load fraud modules remotely. These devices communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers owned and operated by a series of distinct but cooperative threat actors. The BADBOX and BADBOX 2.0 threat actors exploit software or hardware supply chains or distribute seemingly benign applications that contain ‘loader’ functionality in order to infect these devices and applications with the backdoor. Once a fraud module is deployed, infected devices may become part of a botnet and subsequently have the capacity to conduct several attacks.” Some of the attacks the botnet is capable of include programmatic ad fraud, click fraud, and residential proxy services, which lead to account takeovers, fake account creations, DDoS attacks, malware distribution, and one-time password thefts, according to HUMAN. The cybersecurity firm goes on to note that Android TV OS devices or Play Protect-certified Android devices were not affected by the exploit.

Major Milestone For Strategy Previously known as Strategy, the company has intentionally worked its way up the ladder of success. S&P 500 companies are generally recognized for having the largest corporate treasuries. Moreover, Nvidia is believed to be the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $4.2 trillion. Therefore, overtaking NVDA is no small feat, and Strategy owes a significant part of this performance to the recent rally in Bitcoin price. The companies ahead of Strategy (with a $71 billion treasury reserve) on the list are Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Ford, Meta, and General Motors. BTC Treasury Reserve Serves as Strategy’s Growth Catalyst Notably, the company holds Bitcoin as its primary reserve asset. In the last five years, it has invested strongly in a Bitcoin accumulation strategy. Within the period above, the company has acquired more than 600,000 Bitcoin and is still looking to buy more. According to its new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Strategy acquired an additional 4,225 Bitcoins for approximately $472.5 million between July 7 and July 13. This purchase increased the company’s total stash to 601,550 BTC, valued at over $70.9 billion at the current price of the firstborn digital asset. Metaplanet Learns From MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Playbook Another firm making giant strides with a growing Bitcoin accumulation strategy is Metaplanet. This Japanese financial leader launched this strategy about a year ago and has remained true to it. In the first week of July, it reported a purchase of 2,205 BTC, worth about $238.7 million at the time. Metaplanet’s total crypto holdings climbed to 15,555 BTC as a result of the acquisition. As we advance, the firm aims to accumulate 210,000 BTC by 2027, which is approximately 1% of the total supply. This Bitcoin strategy, which mirrors that of the company, has triggered significant growth for Metaplanet. It is currently ranked as the fifth-largest publicly listed company, holding the top cryptocurrency. As of writing, the price of Bitcoin has jumped by 0.39% in the past 24 hours to $117,930.

2025-07-19 19:00:30+00:00,Bitcoin ETFs Are Booming—But Self-Custody Growth Just Broke 15-Year Streak,"The US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) have continued to soar after they started trading in January 2024, breaking and setting records in the global ETF market. Recently, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (with the ticker IBIT) became the fastest ETF to hit $80 billion in assets under management. Unsurprisingly, the growing popularity and acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs appear to be shifting the crypto investment landscape. As recently revealed by a prominent analyst on the social media platform X, BTC investors seem to be favoring a more traditional way to interact with the world’s largest cryptocurrency. Are Bitcoin ETFs A Deviation From BTC’s Decentralization Ethos? In a July 18 post on X, crypto analyst Willy Woo shared that the growth rate of self-custody Bitcoin users has continued to fall over the past year. This growing development, which Woo attributed to the ascent of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, has led to the end of a 15-year trend. This on-chain insight is based on the Glassnode Entities Net Growth metric, which measures the rate at which new users are coming onto a blockchain network per day (Bitcoin, in this scenario). Woo clarified that this metric does not just track addresses but entities, which refer to addresses forensically clustered together into single controlling users. The Entities Net Growth estimates the difference between new entities and “disappearing” entities (entities with a zero balance that had a non–zero balance at the previous timestamp). As observed in the chart below, this metric has been on a downward trend since 2023, which has worsened since the Bitcoin ETFs debuted in the US. This trend suggests that investors are increasingly choosing to enter the Bitcoin market through institutional crypto products like exchange-traded funds rather than by purchasing directly into private crypto wallets. Woo highlighted in a response to a comment on X that this shift could lead to a centralization of the supply. Interestingly, this development somewhat defeats the primary ethos of Bitcoin as defined by Satoshi Nakamoto, which revolves around building a decentralized financial system. However, the belief is that the Bitcoin ETFs are a gateway to crypto investments for people—primarily the older generation—who can’t easily access them via the typical route (self-custody wallets). A crypto community member on X: ETFs didn’t steal users from cold storage… They opened the market to those who were locked behind compliance walls.

This information comes from a report published by the international organization. According to the document, the government wallet, Chivo, ”does not adjust its bitcoin reserves according to changes in customer deposits.” Since the Chivo wallet does not sell assets, this results in ”minor” discrepancies (no more than 1%). According to the Fund’s experts, this creates the impression that the country''s public sector is accumulating cryptocurrency. The government of the Latin American country plans to receive a $1.4 billion loan from the IMF under a 40-month program. Taking into account additional financing from the Inter-American Development Bank and other regional institutions, the total amount of the package may exceed $3.5 billion. As part of the agreements with the Fund, the Salvadoran authorities have pledged to adjust their current bitcoin strategy. As early as January, lawmakers made the necessary changes to regulations, which included: Withdrawing government support for the Chivo wallet Mandating that taxes be paid only in U.S. dollars Limiting transactions with bitcoin for the public sector Making the acceptance of cryptocurrency payments voluntary for individuals However, according to Stacy Herbert, head of the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador continued to build up its crypto reserves ”at an accelerated pace,” despite the agreement. At that time, authorities reportedly held 5,980.8 BTC. In May, the IMF warned the government to stop buying cryptocurrency, stating that a staff-level agreement had been reached. At the same time, according to data from the Bitcoin Office, bitcoin inflows continued regularly. On May 19, the authorities added another 1 BTC to the balance, bringing the reserves to 6,242 BTC. Attached to the IMF report is a letter of intent addressed to IMF chief Christina Georgieva, dated June 11. In the message, Douglas Pablo Rodriguez Fuentes, President of the Central Bank of El Salvador, and Rogelio Posada Molina, Minister of Finance of El Salvador, assured: ”In line with program commitments, the amount of bitcoin held by the public sector remains unchanged, and we are taking steps to mitigate fiscal risks by reducing our role in the Chivo wallet and rethinking the BTC project.” El Salvador has been mining bitcoin at a state-owned geothermal power plant since 2021.

2025-07-19 19:55:11+00:00,Bitcoin 2025 Price Analysis: BTC Projected to Reach $300K as Ozak AI Targets $1 From $0.005 in AI-Driven Rally,"Bitcoin (BTC), the king of the crypto market, remains a dominant force as digital assets gain increasing institutional traction. With macroeconomic shifts, growing ETF adoption, and limited supply dynamics driving long-term price, many analysts are pointing towards an ambitious $300,000 price target by 2025. At the same time, a new project within the crypto world— Ozak AI (OZ) —is shooting early investor attention with its AI-powered utility and low access price of $0.005. As BTC solidifies its location as a store of value, Ozak AI is emerging as one of the most compelling AI-token narratives of this cycle. Bitcoin’s Path to $300,000 The current price of Bitcoin hovers around $117,546, and recent technical setups indicate a robust upward trend. The introduction and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have performed a pivotal position in onboarding traditional capital into crypto markets. Additionally, institutional adoption is at an all-time high, with banks, asset managers, or even governments exploring Bitcoin either as an asset or a reserve hedge. Bitcoin’s shortage is a major driving force. With the handiest 21 million BTC ever to exist—and almost 93% already mined—the supply shock from increasing demand is growing bullish strain. The 2024 halving event has similarly reduced block rewards, intensifying the scarcity effect. All these elements set the level for a major upward movement that might push BTC in the direction of the $300K mark through 2025, specifically in bullish macro surroundings. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Support and Resistance Levels Bitcoin’s ascending channel pattern on TradingView highlights a well-defined bullish trajectory, where price consistently respects upper resistance and lower support boundaries. Within this pattern, three key resistance levels to watch are: $130,000, a short-term breakout target. $180,000, an area that aligns with Fibonacci extension zones. $300,000, the projected cycle top based on institutional momentum. On the downside, Bitcoin has solid structural supports at: $105,000, the lower boundary of the ascending channel. $92,000, a strong accumulation zone from recent months. $78,000, a critical psychological level and base for long-term buyers. These levels collectively indicate that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further gains, with each dip offering potential buying opportunities. Ozak AI: The Next Big Thing in AI and Blockchain Integration While Bitcoin garners attention as a store-of-value asset, Ozak AI (OZ) is turning heads with its futuristic approach to decentralized artificial intelligence. Ozak AI is presently in Stage 4 of its presale , priced at simply $0.005, and has already raised over $1.3 million—a clear indicator of early traction. The project aims to create a decentralized AI ecosystem in which customers can leverage blockchain-secured AI gear for predictive analytics, automated workflows, intelligent agents, and greater. As the global interest in AI continues to bounce, Ozak AI gives an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize at the intersection of two mega traits: AI and crypto. The tokenomics of OZ are designed to help long-term growth, with a capped supply, deflationary mechanisms, and real-world AI utilities that move far past hype. If the challenge hits its $1 target, early traders should see a 200x return, placing it some of the highest potential ROI performances of the current cycle. Why BTC and Ozak AI Could Dominate the 2025 Narrative Bitcoin and Ozak AI may represent two ends of the crypto spectrum, but their investment theses complement each other. Bitcoin offers macroeconomic resilience, institutional adoption, and global recognition. Ozak AI brings innovative utility, early-stage upside, and exposure to one of the most disruptive technologies of the century. In a maturing crypto market, smart investors are looking for both security and opportunity. Bitcoin provides the former, acting as a foundational asset for portfolios. Ozak AI offers the latter, serving as a high-upside play with clear demand in AI-focused sectors like finance, logistics, marketing, and healthcare. If Bitcoin does reach $300,000 via 2025, it might mark a 2.5x increase from present levels—a big pass for a trillion-dollar asset. Simultaneously, if Ozak AI hits its $1 milestone, early investors at the $0.005 level ought to see exquisite profits. The contrasting risk-reward profiles of these assets cause them to ideal opposite numbers for a different crypto portfolio. Bitcoin stays the king, but new narratives like Ozak AI are proving that the next era of crypto increase could be driven via utility, innovation, and AI integration. For investors looking to role themselves for the following wave of crypto possibility, each BTC and OZ offer awesome, powerful paths to long-term price introduction.

Bitcoin’s Path to $300,000 The current price of Bitcoin hovers around $117,546, and recent technical setups indicate a robust upward trend. The introduction and success of spot Bitcoin ETFs have performed a pivotal position in onboarding traditional capital into crypto markets. Additionally, institutional adoption is at an all-time high, with banks, asset managers, or even governments exploring Bitcoin either as an asset or a reserve hedge. Bitcoin’s shortage is a major driving force. With the handiest 21 million BTC ever to exist—and almost 93% already mined—the supply shock from increasing demand is growing bullish strain. The 2024 halving event has similarly reduced block rewards, intensifying the scarcity effect. All these elements set the level for a major upward movement that might push BTC in the direction of the $300K mark through 2025, specifically in bullish macro surroundings. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Key Support and Resistance Levels Bitcoin’s ascending channel pattern on TradingView highlights a well-defined bullish trajectory, where price consistently respects upper resistance and lower support boundaries. Within this pattern, three key resistance levels to watch are: $130,000, a short-term breakout target. $180,000, an area that aligns with Fibonacci extension zones. $300,000, the projected cycle top based on institutional momentum. On the downside, Bitcoin has solid structural supports at: $105,000, the lower boundary of the ascending channel. $92,000, a strong accumulation zone from recent months. $78,000, a critical psychological level and base for long-term buyers. These levels collectively indicate that Bitcoin is well-positioned for further gains, with each dip offering potential buying opportunities. Ozak AI: The Next Big Thing in AI and Blockchain Integration While Bitcoin garners attention as a store-of-value asset, Ozak AI (OZ) is turning heads with its futuristic approach to decentralized artificial intelligence. Ozak AI is presently in Stage 4 of its presale , priced at simply $0.005, and has already raised over $1.3 million—a clear indicator of early traction. The project aims to create a decentralized AI ecosystem in which customers can leverage blockchain-secured AI gear for predictive analytics, automated workflows, intelligent agents, and greater. As the global interest in AI continues to bounce, Ozak AI gives an unprecedented opportunity to capitalize at the intersection of two mega traits: AI and crypto. The tokenomics of OZ are designed to help long-term growth, with a capped supply, deflationary mechanisms, and real-world AI utilities that move far past hype. If the challenge hits its $1 target, early traders should see a 200x return, placing it some of the highest potential ROI performances of the current cycle. Why BTC and Ozak AI Could Dominate the 2025 Narrative Bitcoin and Ozak AI may represent two ends of the crypto spectrum, but their investment theses complement each other. Bitcoin offers macroeconomic resilience, institutional adoption, and global recognition. Ozak AI brings innovative utility, early-stage upside, and exposure to one of the most disruptive technologies of the century. In a maturing crypto market, smart investors are looking for both security and opportunity. Bitcoin provides the former, acting as a foundational asset for portfolios. Ozak AI offers the latter, serving as a high-upside play with clear demand in AI-focused sectors like finance, logistics, marketing, and healthcare. If Bitcoin does reach $300,000 via 2025, it might mark a 2.5x increase from present levels—a big pass for a trillion-dollar asset. Simultaneously, if Ozak AI hits its $1 milestone, early investors at the $0.005 level ought to see exquisite profits. The contrasting risk-reward profiles of these assets cause them to ideal opposite numbers for a different crypto portfolio. Bitcoin stays the king, but new narratives like Ozak AI are proving that the next era of crypto increase could be driven via utility, innovation, and AI integration. For investors looking to role themselves for the following wave of crypto possibility, each BTC and OZ offer awesome, powerful paths to long-term price introduction. About Ozak AI Ozak AI is a blockchain-based crypto task that provides an innovative platform that focuses on predictive AI and advanced data analytics for financial markets."

In an earnings call for the second quarter of 2025, Dimon said that the fintech-fee decision was made to protect its customers when asked about the new policy. “So, this is very important. So forget pricing for a second, we are in favor of the customer, but we think the customer has the right to if they want to share their information. What we ask people to do is, what do they – do they actually know what’s being shared? What is actually being shared? It shouldn’t be everything. It should be what their customer wants. It should have a time limit because some of these things went on for years. It should not be re-marketed or resold to third parties. And so, we’re kind of in favor of all that, done properly. And then the payment, it just costs a lot of money to set up the APIs and stuff like that to run the system’s protection. So, we just think it should be done and done right. And that’s the main part. It’s not like you can’t do it.” The fintech companies use the information to make it easier for their customers to send, receive and trade money. JPMorgan is reportedly poised to collect hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the service. Alex Rampell, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and co-founder of the buy now, pay later business Affirm, is slamming JPMorgan’s move, warning it will make it more difficult to move money into crypto. “This isn’t about a new revenue stream. It’s about strangling competition. And if they get away with this, every bank will follow… If it suddenly costs $10 to move $100 into a Coinbase or Robinhood account – maybe fewer people will do it.” Arjun Sethi, co-CEO of crypto platform Kraken, is criticizing JPMorgan for “asserting ownership over data that is generated by users but stored inside infrastructure the bank controls.” “We should not be optimizing for defensibility through restriction. We should be leveraging our position and profitability to build better access, more open architecture and more composable systems. That means investing in protocols, not just platforms.

Those transfers made balances pop up on public dashboards. But those were just internal shifts. They didn’t draw on taxpayer money or involve the market. Small ups and downs in the Chivo e‑wallet also came from internal corrections, not new deposits. Turns out the IMF did in fact make El Salvador stop Bitcoin purchases in order to get a fiat loan.

2025-07-19 20:30:49+00:00,"XRP Analyst Sees Clear Path Beyond $100 And Toward $1,000","A popular XRP proponent recently projected a clear path for XRP to reach $1,000. Particularly, crypto commentator BarriC laid out a multi-stage price forecast that places the XRP price on a trajectory toward $1,000. The statement, posted on the social media platform X, follows XRP’s recent surge to a new all-time high for the first time since 2018. Expert Predicts Multi-Stage XRP Price Explosion XRP has been on an interesting price run since the beginning of the month, which kicked off when it broke out of its long-term consolidation below $2.2 on July 5. This was followed by a string of inflows alongside the rest of the crypto market as Bitcoin pushed to new price territories above $120,000. Related Reading: XRP To $13 in 40 Days? Analyst Predicts Explosive Final Rally However, although Bitcoin peaked at $122,800 on July 14 and has since entered a corrective phase below $120,000, the altcoin has managed to keep up its gains in the days after July 14. This detachment from Bitcoin’s momentum started after the SEC’s approval of ProShares’ XRP ETFs, which has contributed to the crypto asset’s push to a new all-time high of $3.65 in the past 24 hours and its market cap breaking the $200 billion threshold. Interestingly, XRP’s price is now trading in unknown territory, and the next price target for bulls is $4. BarriC’s post begins with a near-term target of $4 for XRP, which many bullish analysts have been watching closely for weeks. From there, BarriC anticipates a rapid expansion into double digits, forecasting a range between $10 and $20. Although the projection did not come with a technical analysis of XRP’s price action, the outlook that truly captures attention is his final projection: a “clear path” that leads XRP beyond the $100 mark and ultimately to a $1,000 valuation. $1,000 XRP: Path Or Pipe Dream? The notion of XRP reaching $1,000 has been discussed in the past but remains a controversial subject. To achieve a price point in the triple digits, its market capitalization would need to exceed $50 trillion, more than double the value of the most valuable public companies in the world combined. Central to BarriC’s prediction of a $1,000 XRP price is based on the belief that its utility in cross-border payments and banking infrastructure will drive its long-term value. A $1,000 XRP becomes realistic only when mass institutional adoption from banks turns transactional demand into structural demand. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Just Hit A Fresh ATH Above $10 Billion, Will Price Follow Next? On the other hand, price targets like $10 and $100 in the coming years are still realistic based on the current fundamentals of the altcoin and the XRP Ledger. The first step is a break above $4, which can only be possible if XRP manages to secure $3 as its new base price going forward. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.44, up by 22% in the past seven days.

2025-07-19 21:00:00+00:00,Pi Network Price Prediction 2025-2031: Will Pi Price Rebound or Collapse in 2025?,"Key Takeaways: Pi price faces correction below $0.50. Our Pi network price prediction expects the Pi price to surge to a maximum level of $0.6572 in 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $6.72. The Pi Network is experiencing a wave of uncertainty as 268.4 million Pi tokens are set to unlock in July 2025. This unlock will be the biggest Pi token unlock release since launch. Starting July 4, this unlock has driven fresh concerns over selling pressure and market instability, especially with the current Pi Network sentiment already cautious. Historically, similar events have caused sharp drops in Pi coin price, and with $215M worth of tokens hitting the market, the risk remains high. Despite the volatility, Pi continues to expand its ecosystem. Since the launch of Pi App Studio, over 7,900 AI-powered dApps have gone live, helping drive real-world utility across the Pi browser. New features include an app staking system, wallet upgrades, and enhanced node security, positioning Pi as a serious mobile-friendly crypto platform. Still, without major exchange listings or capital inflows, the Pi price may struggle in the short term. In this Pi Network price prediction, we examine recent trends, tokenomics, and market factors to forecast where Pi coin could head between 2025 and 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.44 Price Change 24h -2% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.44 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis PI price is trading $0.4412, showing market indecision as sellers dominate short-term momentum. Support is at $0.4412, acting as an important zone after repeated rejections of lower lows this week. Resistance stands near $0.4700, capping upward movement amid weakening bullish sentiment and declining trading volume. As of July 19th 2025 PIUSDT price fell by around 2% to $0.4412. This drop marks a loss from the previous close and signals short-term bearish sentiment in the Pi Network market, where sellers currently outweigh buyers. Despite growing interest in decentralized finance and real world utility through the Pi browser, the token remains under pressure. Pi 1-day price chart faces bearish pressure as key support nears breakdown On the 24-hour chart, the Pi Network price is trading at $0.4408, reflecting a day drop, highlighting weak short-term sentiment. The MACD shows bearish momentum, with the MACD line trending below the signal line and red histogram bars widening. The RSI remains neutral near the mid-50s at 36.17, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions, though downside risk remains if momentum persists. The price of Pi faces strong resistance near $0.47, while immediate support is forming around $0.42, based on historical candle structure. A daily close below current support may increase selling pressure, while a bounce could trigger renewed interest from traders watching the crypto market closely. PIUSDT Price Chart: TradingView Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network is currently trading at $0.4417, just below a key support zone as selling pressure builds. The MACD line 0.0024 remains below the signal line 0.0028, indicating continued bearish momentum on the 4-hour timeframe. The RSI stands at 42.82, showing weakening buying strength. If Pi coin price fails to hold the current support, the next dip could trigger stronger selling pressure in the Pi Network market. However, a push above $0.45 may revive short-term bullish sentiment in the crypto market, particularly if paired with rising trading volume. PIUSDT Price Chart: TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? If Pi breaks below the $0.4570 support, it could drop further toward the $0.44 zone. A recovery depends on a sustained move above $0.4760 with rising volume. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi.

Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Network Ticker Symbol Pi Price $0.44 Price Change 24h -2% Market Cap $3.74B Circulating Supply 7.62B PI Trading Volume 24h $84.82M All-Time High $2.98 Feb 26, 2025 (4 months ago) All-Time Low $0.4012 Apr 05, 2025 (3 months ago) Pi Network Price Prediction: Technical Analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.44 Price Prediction $0.362891 (-25.21%) Fear & Greed Index 64 (Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 8.63% Green Days 11/30 (37%) 50-Day SMA – 200-Day SMA – 14-Day RSI 35.26 Pi Price Analysis PI price is trading $0.4412, showing market indecision as sellers dominate short-term momentum. Support is at $0.4412, acting as an important zone after repeated rejections of lower lows this week. Resistance stands near $0.4700, capping upward movement amid weakening bullish sentiment and declining trading volume. As of July 19th 2025 PIUSDT price fell by around 2% to $0.4412. This drop marks a loss from the previous close and signals short-term bearish sentiment in the Pi Network market, where sellers currently outweigh buyers. Despite growing interest in decentralized finance and real world utility through the Pi browser, the token remains under pressure. Pi 1-day price chart faces bearish pressure as key support nears breakdown On the 24-hour chart, the Pi Network price is trading at $0.4408, reflecting a day drop, highlighting weak short-term sentiment. The MACD shows bearish momentum, with the MACD line trending below the signal line and red histogram bars widening. The RSI remains neutral near the mid-50s at 36.17, suggesting neither overbought nor oversold conditions, though downside risk remains if momentum persists. The price of Pi faces strong resistance near $0.47, while immediate support is forming around $0.42, based on historical candle structure. A daily close below current support may increase selling pressure, while a bounce could trigger renewed interest from traders watching the crypto market closely. PIUSDT Price Chart: TradingView Pi/USDT 4-Hour Chart Pi Network is currently trading at $0.4417, just below a key support zone as selling pressure builds. The MACD line 0.0024 remains below the signal line 0.0028, indicating continued bearish momentum on the 4-hour timeframe. The RSI stands at 42.82, showing weakening buying strength. If Pi coin price fails to hold the current support, the next dip could trigger stronger selling pressure in the Pi Network market. However, a push above $0.45 may revive short-term bullish sentiment in the crypto market, particularly if paired with rising trading volume. PIUSDT Price Chart: TradingView Pi Network Price Prediction: Levels and Action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.544455 SELL SMA 5 $0.523521 SELL SMA 10 $0.579508 SELL SMA 21 $0.609562 SELL Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.583674 SELL EMA 5 $0.61406 SELL EMA 10 $0.645247 SELL EMA 21 $0.733241 SELL What to expect from Pi price analysis next? If Pi breaks below the $0.4570 support, it could drop further toward the $0.44 zone. A recovery depends on a sustained move above $0.4760 with rising volume. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.66 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly—neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is the Pi price down today? The Pi price is"

2025-07-19 21:26:07+00:00,JUST IN: UK Allegedly Plans to Sell $5 Billion Worth of Bitcoin – Is This the Reason for the Decline?,"According to the Telegraph, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves plans to sell £5 billion worth of seized Bitcoin assets to close a massive gap in public finances. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, together with the police forces, has begun work to establish an official system to sell this large cryptocurrency stock. The total value of the cryptocurrencies seized by police is unknown, but in 2018 alone, 61,000 Bitcoins belonging to a China-based pyramid scheme were seized. At the time, the assets were worth around £270 million, but with Bitcoin reaching $123,000 (about £92,000) last week, they are now worth more than £5.4 billion. The government plans to develop a “crypto custody and sales framework” to securely store and sell these digital assets. It''s not yet clear how much of the proceeds from sales will be transferred to the treasury, but proceeds from crime are typically shared between the central government and law enforcement. When victims remain unidentified, the treasury is known to receive a larger share.

High inflation and interest rates are driving up borrowing costs, while weak economic growth is weighing on revenue.

This projection isn’t just boosting BTC’s appeal—it’s igniting interest across the altcoin space, especially among presale tokens with strong utility and growth potential. One name that’s starting to stand out is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized finance project gaining attention as it approaches a major milestone: over 80% of its presale Phase 5 is now sold out, and a 20% price increase is just around the corner. Bitcoin’s Momentum Is Fueling Altcoin Opportunities With fresh capital flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs and global sentiment improving, Bitcoin’s push toward six figures is more than just speculation—it’s becoming a broader signal of renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency market. The narrative is shifting back to fundamentals, and that momentum is lifting not only BTC, but also altcoins that bring real value and clear use cases to the table. While many are watching Bitcoin for long-term gains, others are looking at what $1,000 invested today might become in tokens that haven’t hit the open market yet. That’s exactly why attention is turning toward Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is building a lending and borrowing protocol that operates without centralized control. Everything runs on smart contracts, which means users keep control of their assets while interacting with fully transparent and automated lending markets. The process is straightforward. Lenders deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins into Mutuum’s liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent their share of the pool and automatically increase in value over time as interest accrues. When it’s time to withdraw, users can exchange their mtTokens back for the underlying asset along with the interest that’s accumulated. No need to wait for a match or counterparty. The smart contract handles everything in real time. Borrowers, on the other hand, can tap into liquidity by posting overcollateralized assets. This means that to borrow $1,000, a user would typically need to secure the loan with around $1,500 in digital assets as collateral. This structure ensures stability and keeps the protocol solvent, while still giving users access to capital without selling their holdings. And because borrowers can choose between stable or variable interest rates, the system works for both short-term flexibility and longer-term strategies. What makes Mutuum different is that these mechanics are not theoretical. The protocol is already under development, and its beta version is expected to go live alongside the token launch—a clear sign that this isn’t just a whitepaper project. A Stablecoin That Makes Sense In addition to its lending platform, Mutuum is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin that will be fully backed by assets supplied within the ecosystem. This stablecoin will maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar through on-chain mechanisms—not through external custodians or unverifiable reserves. To generate the stablecoin, users must deposit collateral exceeding the value of the tokens they mint. Once the borrowed amount is repaid, those stablecoins are permanently removed from circulation. This system prevents inflation while preserving full transparency. Unlike many existing stablecoins that rely on trust in third parties, Mutuum’s model is algorithmic, decentralized, and designed to maintain long-term reliability. It’s another layer of utility that gives the MUTM token real-world function within the protocol. Interest generated from stablecoin borrowing goes directly to the treasury, reinforcing the ecosystem’s value over time. Nearly Sold Out Before Phase 6 The presale has already passed some major milestones. Over $12.6 million has been raised, with more than 13,600 holders joining so far. With more than 80% of Phase 5 already completed, the $0.03 price point is approaching its final stretch. As the presale moves into Phase 6, the token price is set to rise to $0.035, marking a 20% increase for incoming participants. That price will continue to climb across the remaining phases until launch, where MUTM is expected to list at $0.06. Those entering now are looking at a potential 2x gain before the token even hits exchanges. Adding to the momentum is the completion of a full audit by CertiK, which gave Mutuum a score of 95, confirming the security and readiness of its smart contracts. To encourage continued transparency and safety, the team also launched a $50,000 bug bounty program and a $100,000 giveaway for early contributors—both of which have helped strengthen engagement from new and existing investors.

2025-07-19 22:00:29+00:00,Signal That Sparked 630% XRP Price Rally In 2024 Just Got Triggered Again,"The XRP price action could be setting up for a major rally as a key bullish signal has just reappeared on the charts. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this historical indicator previously preceded a massive 630% surge in XRP’s price back in 2024 . Now, with the same signal flashing again, the analyst points to the potential of another strong move to the upside. XRP Price Flashes Historically Bullish Signal A potentially explosive historical signal has just resurfaced on the XRP price chart , fueling optimism for a potential breakout ahead. In his latest XRP analysis report on X social media, Martinez reveals that the cryptocurrency’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has flashed a Golden Cross—a pattern generally associated with powerful bullish momentum. Martinez highlighted that the last time his MVRV ratio crossover appeared, in 2024, XRP skyrocketed by over 630%, marking one of its most dramatic price moves in recent years. Now, the same bullish pattern has been triggered again, fueling speculation of a potential history repeat . The analyst’s chart shows the MVRV ratio, in orange, spiking above its 200-day Moving Average (MA) , in red, with XRP’s price already beginning to respond positively.

The XRP price action could be setting up for a major rally as a key bullish signal has just reappeared on the charts. According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this historical indicator previously preceded a massive 630% surge in XRP’s price back in 2024 . Now, with the same signal flashing again, the analyst points to the potential of another strong move to the upside. XRP Price Flashes Historically Bullish Signal A potentially explosive historical signal has just resurfaced on the XRP price chart , fueling optimism for a potential breakout ahead. In his latest XRP analysis report on X social media, Martinez reveals that the cryptocurrency’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has flashed a Golden Cross—a pattern generally associated with powerful bullish momentum. Martinez highlighted that the last time his MVRV ratio crossover appeared, in 2024, XRP skyrocketed by over 630%, marking one of its most dramatic price moves in recent years. Now, the same bullish pattern has been triggered again, fueling speculation of a potential history repeat . The analyst’s chart shows the MVRV ratio, in orange, spiking above its 200-day Moving Average (MA) , in red, with XRP’s price already beginning to respond positively.

However, the premier cryptocurrency has experienced a slight price retracement since reaching this milestone. Interestingly, this fall in Bitcoin market prices has collided with a widespread gain in the altcoin market, with specific large-cap tokens notching up remarkable gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Not Over Yet? Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Further Upside 7-Day SMA Bitcoin Whale Exchange Transfers Near 12,000 BTC – Glassnode In an X post of July 18, prominent blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shares a profound on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market, stating that the volume of whale transfers to exchanges is presently on the rise. Notably, this development comes as Bitcoin experiences a moderate price correction after reaching a new ATH earlier last week, as previously stated. Glassnode explains that the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of BTC transferred from whale wallets to exchanges is approaching 12,000 BTC, one of the highest weekly volumes recorded in 2025. Interestingly, this surge in transfer mirrors levels last seen in early November 2024, a period that preceded a popular crypto bull run. When large holders move their BTC to centralized exchanges, it typically suggests they are preparing to liquidate some or all of their positions, either to take profits or to rotate capital into other opportunities. However, the latter scenario seems likely, especially considering recent trends in the altcoin market. Amidst Bitcoin’s price correction, several altcoins have recorded significant price gains, prompting ideas that the altseason may have begun. For context, data from CoinMarketCap shows that the premier cryptocurrency experienced a mere 0.27% gain over the past week, while altcoins such as Ethereum, XRP, and Solana registered price surges of 19.98%, 25.98%, and 8.86%, respectively. Historically, this development mirrors a characteristic altseason, when other cryptocurrencies generally outperform Bitcoin, leading to a decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance. Altseasons are triggered when investors begin reallocating profits from BTC into higher-beta assets, seeking larger returns due to the lower market caps of these tokens. However, more data from CoinMarketCap shows the altseason index is at 36/100, indicating that while altcoins are beginning to gain momentum, the market has not yet fully transitioned into a confirmed altseason. An index value below 50 suggests that Bitcoin is still outperforming a majority of altcoins over 90 days. Investors should stay alert for a cross above 75 which would suggest a full-fledged altseason to be declared.

2025-07-19 23:00:43+00:00,"BNB Faces Resistance, PUMP Signals Breakout, While BlockDAG Became 2025 Sensation With NO VESTING PASS","The crypto market is showing both excitement and hesitation. Not every top crypto pick is moving the same way. The PUMP token price is gaining energy after its first buyback, with signs of a breakout coming soon. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) is cooling off after hitting $700, facing resistance as many locked in gains. In the middle of all this, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a surprising path. It has removed vesting rules with a fresh twist called the NO VESTING PASS. This pass lets all buyers get their coins at launch. No waiting. With just 6 days left for this offer, BlockDAG has turned normal presale rules upside down along with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. PUMP Token Nears Breakout After Buyback The PUMP token price recently climbed to $0.006144 after its first official buyback. This caught the market’s attention and pushed the price into a tight symmetrical triangle pattern. The trading volume jumped over 140%, and holders now number more than 40,000. Experts are watching closely as PUMP nears a key resistance zone at $0.0062. Although there’s strong momentum, a full breakout hasn’t happened yet. Support lies between $0.0052 and $0.0057, giving PUMP some breathing space if it slows down. With more people entering the market, the PUMP token price is on breakout alert, but it still needs to confirm the move before anything is certain. BNB Falls Below $700 After Rally The recent Binance Coin (BNB) price update shows nearly a 2% drop in 24 hours, pulling back to around $680 after touching $700. Many users took profits after Bitcoin crossed $120,000, causing a ripple effect that also cooled down BNB. Technical signs are mixed. Strong resistance remains between $690 and $695. Still, a short bounce from $675 brought in some fresh buying. Despite BNB marking its 8th year and burning $1B, short-term direction remains unclear. The Binance Coin price depends now on whether bulls can break above resistance, or if the drop will continue. BlockDAG Presale Surges Beyond $342M With NO VESTING PASS Boost BlockDAG’s presale is setting new records. It has already raised over $342 million and sold 24 billion BDAG coins. More than 200,000 people around the world are holding BDAG, and 2 million users are actively mining with the X1 app, driving fresh energy every day. What’s the price? Right now, it’s just $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. That’s a rare chance to grab BDAG before it lists at $0.05, offering a possible 3025% return. And here’s the game-changer: BlockDAG has launched the NO VESTING PASS. Unlike other presales that lock coins or delay access, this pass gives buyers full control. Anyone who buys BDAG within the next 6 days gets 100% of their coins on launch day. No waiting. No lock-ins. The NO VESTING PASS completely removes all unlocking phases and timelines. Buyers get everything right when BDAG goes live. This isn’t just about getting in early, it’s about having real control from day one. Instead of watching your gains roll out slowly, you can make use of the full 3025% potential right away. With demand for BDAG growing fast, this feature brings a freedom most other projects don’t offer. BlockDAG is rewarding belief in the project, and it’s doing it without delay. Key Takeaway In this market, timing is everything. While PUMP is waiting to break out and BNB struggles with resistance, both are stuck in “wait and see” mode. But BlockDAG is already moving fast. It has raised $342 million, sold 24 billion coins, and introduced a major change with the NO VESTING PASS. This feature lets buyers unlock 100% of their BDAG coins the moment the coin launches. No waiting. No delays. And with a possible 3025% upside, it’s a big shift from how most crypto launches work. This 10-day NO VESTING PASS is only available for a limited time. Now, just 6 days are left. While others wait for breakout signs, BlockDAG is already delivering results. It’s not just another project, it’s the one already paying off.

2025-07-20 00:26:59+00:00,Bitcoin on edge as UK considers selling seized $7.1B BTC stash,"The UK government could be about to embark on a huge Bitcoin stash sale, worth more than £5.4 billion ($7.1 billion). The stash consists of Bitcoin seized in 2018 as part of a police operation to take down a Chinese Ponzi scheme using Britain to hoard crypto assets among others.. The 61,000 Bitcoin seized at the time were worth a fraction of what they are now. However, with the value of Bitcoin skyrocketing, trading for more than $123,000 (£92,000) last week, the haul is now one of the biggest crypto seizures worldwide. Such a sell-off would occur at a crucial time for the UK economy. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing growing calls to fill a £20 billion fiscal hole. The country is struggling with stagnant growth, climbing borrowing costs, and stubborn inflation that is already raising concerns about keeping interest rates up longer. To make up the shortfall, ministers have signalled that they may have to increase taxes, a politically perilous gambit. At this moment, the windfall from seized Bitcoin is seen as an unorthodox but attractive solvent. The Home Office is developing proposals for a “cryptoasset holding and realization framework”, which would enable police to store and sell digital currencies such as Bitcoin securely. It would also allow for efficient handling, liquidation, and re-distribution of assets seized during investigations. It’s unclear how much cryptocurrency the UK government currently holds. However, the volume of digital assets seized by police forces across the country last year alone highlights a significant shift—digital currencies are now rivaling, and in some cases surpassing, traditional cash in scale and value. Treasury move rattles Bitcoin market News of the potential sale has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin, which has more than doubled in value since the start of the year, continues to climb, fueled not only by economic fundamentals but also by a growing sense of purpose and momentum in the market. The signing of the GENIUS Act in the US last week is a necessary milestone towards global crypto legitimacy. It opens the door to wider acceptance and reduces regulatory uncertainty for big players in the digital asset industry. Politicians, meanwhile, such as Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, have also been advocating for the UK to create a national pool of Bitcoin. Doing so, he says, would make the country financially independent and a global leader in the emerging digital economy. He has even floated this concept publicly — he called for a “crypto revolution” during a speech in Las Vegas in May. However, Labour has dismissed Farage’s plan, branding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as too unstable to keep such vital sovereign wealth in. Chancellor Reeves, in contrast, has concentrated on using Bitcoin proceeds to offset lost tax revenue, not to hedge against currency instability. The Treasury does not have a direct say on whether to dispose of confiscated crypto, but sources say the department is paying close attention to what happens. Any pushes here would greatly impact Bitcoin markets due to the size of the funds at play. Law enforcement drives crypto sale decisions While the potential windfall is a thrilling prospect for Treasury officials, law enforcement has the power to sell the Bitcoin. Seized digital assets are handled by bodies such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional police forces. If the assets are unreturnable to crime victims, the proceeds are divided between the central government and law enforcement programs. In the 2018 confiscation, victims of the Chinese Ponzi scam demanded the return of their Bitcoins. Legal challenges could slow down or prevent any sale. However, if courts find that the victims cannot be traced or made whole, the state could be liquidated. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been central to contemporary financial crime, from scams and fraud to money laundering. As law enforcement has put more emphasis on tracking, freezing, and draining off these funds, focusing on what to do with these assets is becoming increasingly urgent in the new world of digitally induced crime.

However, Labour has dismissed Farage’s plan, branding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as too unstable to keep such vital sovereign wealth in. Chancellor Reeves, in contrast, has concentrated on using Bitcoin proceeds to offset lost tax revenue, not to hedge against currency instability. The Treasury does not have a direct say on whether to dispose of confiscated crypto, but sources say the department is paying close attention to what happens. Any pushes here would greatly impact Bitcoin markets due to the size of the funds at play. Law enforcement drives crypto sale decisions While the potential windfall is a thrilling prospect for Treasury officials, law enforcement has the power to sell the Bitcoin. Seized digital assets are handled by bodies such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional police forces. If the assets are unreturnable to crime victims, the proceeds are divided between the central government and law enforcement programs. In the 2018 confiscation, victims of the Chinese Ponzi scam demanded the return of their Bitcoins. Legal challenges could slow down or prevent any sale. However, if courts find that the victims cannot be traced or made whole, the state could be liquidated. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been central to contemporary financial crime, from scams and fraud to money laundering. As law enforcement has put more emphasis on tracking, freezing, and draining off these funds, focusing on what to do with these assets is becoming increasingly urgent in the new world of digitally induced crime.

2025-07-20 01:46:23+00:00,US lawmaker slams GENIUS Bill as CBDC trojan horse,"US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has warned starkly against the newly introduced GENIUS Act, which she fears will push a forced agenda in the US for a state-backed Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Greene says that despite being pitched as a stablecoin regulatory framework , the bill includes features and control features you would find in a CBDC. “This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency.” Greene wrote on X. The GENIUS Act sought legal clarity around issuing stablecoins and operating them in the US. Yet Greene and others fear that under the hood, it effectively enables sweeping financial surveillance and control like state-run digital currency. Industry voices alarm over privacy risks There has been fierce support in the broader cryptonetworks community for Greene’s criticism. Her concerns have not gone unheard, with several other leaders and industry experts voicing similar fears, citing that the proposed GENIUS Act threatens to impact the underlying ethos of decentralization in digital currency negatively. Economist and Bitcoin maximalist Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, said in a recent podcast that the US dollar is already, in many ways, a digital currency. He argued that whether in physical form or through an app, the dollar functions as a digital token of the state, monitored and tracked by the government. Jean Rausis, co-founder of Smardex, said governments understand that controlling stablecoins means controlling financial transactions. He added that with centralized systems, authorities can freeze assets, reverse payments, and track spending, making stablecoins nearly identical to CBDCs. This sentiment represents a shared skepticism in crypto about any regulatory framework that would put stablecoins under centralized control. Privacy and financial autonomy are the beginnings of a bridge too far. For many of these people, the concepts of privacy and financial autonomy are simply non-negotiable, and any bill that threatens to interfere with these principles is met with outright defiance. GENIUS Act spurs concerns over financial surveillance The GENIUS Act has undergone several revisions since its initial release, with the latest major revision being in March 2025. These developments have introduced more stringent AML obligations, “KYC” requirements, and sanctions compliance requirements. And though they have been justified as necessary shields against criminal abuse, critics say they amount to invasive financial surveillance. Stablecoin issuers would be required to collect and share customer information and track all transactions; they would sometimes need to suspend payments if regulators tell them to, without passing information on why the transactions are occurring. For many in crypto land, this is not one inch closer to authoritarian repression, but a horrifying mile. This is all fine and good until 10 years later, issuers are required to keep some of that money in regulated banks and go through draconian AML checks, and the government freezes or confiscates the funds like they would any other bank account. The problem isn’t limited to the United States. The CBDCs are actively being rolled out in other countries, such as China and the EU. US crypto proponents fear the GENIUS Act, in pretending to support innovation, could take America down that same road, only low-key.

BlockDAG Drops NO VESTING PASS While Kaspa Eyes 10x & PEPE Target 75% Gain","The crypto market is heating up fast, and three names are pulling ahead. PEPE shows signs of a 75% breakout backed by momentum and an active community. Kaspa (KAS) is lining up a 10x surge, thanks to its speed and tech edge powered by BlockDAG design. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is making the biggest move right now. For 6 days only, it’s offering a NO VESTING PASS that gives 100% coin access at launch. No wait, no delays. This puts BDAG in a strong spot as a top pick for anyone eyeing the best crypto for 2025. Kaspa (KAS) Price Outlook Points to a 10x Climb Kaspa (KAS) stands out in the current cycle with its fast BlockDAG structure and solid security. Its potential is clear, especially if Bitcoin touches $200K. Experts project KAS could climb to $0.85–$1.00 in the best case, or stay between $0.25–$0.35 in more cautious outlooks. Either way, that’s more than 10x above today’s levels. With a deflationary model, scalability, and community support, Kaspa (KAS) price outlook shows strength. It’s shaping up to be one of the top altcoins ready to run in the next cycle. PEPE Price Forecast Aims for Breakout and 75% Upside The PEPE price forecast suggests it’s one of the most watched meme coins right now. Chart signals show a falling channel with breakout potential, and analysts expect gains of 75%, with a target near $0.000022. PEPE has seen a 26% jump this week and 13% over the last month. Whale action and fresh exchange listings are keeping the buzz alive. With talk of a move to $0.000035 by 2025, PEPE could take the lead in the meme coin race. Claim 100% of BDAG at Launch with No Lockup – Only 6 Days Left The NO VESTING PASS gives traders a rare chance to gain full access to their BlockDAG (BDAG) coins instantly. For just 6 days, every BDAG purchase comes fully unlocked at launch, skipping the usual wait time seen in most presales. No lock-up periods, no delays, just full control right from the start. With Bitcoin hitting new highs and BlockDAG heading toward its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the timing couldn’t be better. Anyone who buys BDAG within this limited window can take advantage of early access and act without restrictions. This one-week offer removes the usual barriers, putting the buyer in charge from the very first moment. Keep in mind, this offer only applies to BDAG bought during this time. Any bonus rewards or promo-related coins will still follow the standard vesting process. But for direct BDAG purchases, the path to instant access is now wide open. This is a rare chance to get ahead before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. The NO VESTING PASS makes it possible to skip the wait and move fast. For anyone aiming to ride BlockDAG’s momentum, there’s no better moment to step in. The Bottom Line While the PEPE price forecast and Kaspa (KAS) price outlook show exciting growth potential, BlockDAG takes a different route. With the NO VESTING PASS now live, buyers can unlock 100% of their BDAG coins at launch, giving them the power to react right away.

The latest 13F filings show Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has lowered its stake in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, a benchmark fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500. That fund now makes up about 8.5% of Bridgewater’s overall portfolio as of the end of March. Simultaneously, the hedge fund has increased its exposure to SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of gold bullion, less its expenses. Bridgewater increased its GLD holdings by about 33%, allocating approximately $340 million in total exposure to the precious metal. The move comes as Dalio repeatedly warns the US dollar’s decline could eventually trigger stagflation – a dreaded economic outcome marked by high inflation, high unemployment and low economic growth. But Bridgewater’s portfolio is not merely defensive. Alongside GLD, the firm has dramatically boosted its position in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Bridgewater increased its Alibaba holdings by over 3,000%, attaining 5,660,258 shares worth approximately $680 million. That makes it one of the fund’s top holdings. Alibaba’s stock has risen approximately 42% year-to-date, driven by strong growth in its cloud computing segment.

2025-07-20 02:30:41+00:00,Litecoin Sharp Pullback: Scalping Opportunities Emerge While LTCBTC Seeks Stability,"In a recent post on X, CRYPTOWZRD pointed out that Litecoin ended the day on a bearish note, with LTCBTC giving up its gains in a sharp reversal. He emphasized the need for stronger, more stable price action from the LTCBTC pair before expecting a solid move in Litecoin. For now, his focus remains on the intraday chart, where he’s watching closely for short-term opportunities to scalp quick trades. LTCBTC Spike Fizzles After Bitcoin Dominance Rebounds According to CRYPTOWZRD, Litecoin and its BTC pair (LTCBTC) both ended the day with bearish daily candle closes, signaling potential short-term weakness. Despite showing some upward momentum earlier in the day, the broader market conditions shifted, impacting Litecoin’s price action significantly. Related Reading: Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack? LTCBTC experienced a brief spike, primarily triggered by a drop in Bitcoin dominance. This short-lived move created a temporary window for bullish momentum in Litecoin. However, the gains were not sustained, and much of the spike was quickly retraced as Bitcoin dominance began to rebound. As Bitcoin regained strength, Litecoin’s price action closely mirrored the movements of BTC and LTCBTC. This correlation led Litecoin to test the $112 resistance level once more, but the rejection at that zone caused it to lose ground and slide back toward the $96 support region. CRYPTOWZRD noted that any significant upside for Litecoin will likely depend on LTCBTC turning bullish again, a move that typically coincides with a drop in Bitcoin dominance. Until that shift occurs, the path higher remains uncertain, and traders may need to remain cautious of potential downside pressure. For now, the expert’s focus is shifting to lower timeframes, where he aims to identify short-term formations for scalping opportunities. Volatility Expected To Increase Near Key Levels For Litecoin CRYPTOWZRD concluded his analysis by noting that the intraday chart for Litecoin showed a clear bearish structure throughout the day. Price action lacked strength, and any upward movement was quickly met with resistance. This points to ongoing uncertainty in the short term, with sellers still maintaining some control. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level Looking ahead, he emphasized that a clean reversal and reclaim of the $102 resistance zone could shift momentum. If Litecoin manages to hold above that level, it may open the door for a push toward the $112 resistance area. As his final verdict, CRYPTOWZRD warned that if Bitcoin doesn’t provide a strong directional move soon, Litecoin could continue to trade sideways with choppy volatility over the weekend. In the meantime, patience is key — traders should wait for a more mature, high-probability setup before entering new positions.

If Litecoin manages to hold above that level, it may open the door for a push toward the $112 resistance area. As his final verdict, CRYPTOWZRD warned that if Bitcoin doesn’t provide a strong directional move soon, Litecoin could continue to trade sideways with choppy volatility over the weekend. In the meantime, patience is key — traders should wait for a more mature, high-probability setup before entering new positions. Featured image from iStock, chart from Tradingview.com"

Meanwhile, three alternative cryptocurrencies are edging close to their record highs, within a small margin of their peak prices. Additionally, there’s excitement about a budget-friendly token that might see a tenfold increase in value this week. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges TRON: Empowering Creators in a Decentralized Digital World TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform aiming to transform how digital content is shared and rewarded. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, it started on Ethereum but moved to its own network in 2018. TRON gives content creators full ownership rights and more rewards for their work. By cutting out intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook, it lets consumers reward creators directly. This means artists get a fair share of the income from their content. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, with a public ledger where everyone can see what’s happening. In today’s market, TRX may appeal to those interested in platforms that empower creators. Compared to Ethereum, TRON offers developers a way to build dApps without worrying about high fees. As trends shift toward decentralization, TRON’s focus on fair rewards and easy content sharing makes it stand out in the crypto world.

The Canadian and popular crypto figure is currently undergoing trial after stealing $2 million from the Solana meme coin factory. Dunn Settles For Prison, Hints At Accepting Guilty Plea In May 2024, Jarett Dunn, a developer at Pump.fun, drained the platform of almost $2 million in SOL, which was diverted to multiple addresses. Thereafter, Dunn started distributing this stolen wealth to several wallets holding Solana memecoins or NFTs, allowing the Canadian to gain some following in the crypto community. Notably, Jarett Dunn took responsibility for the exploits within minutes of the operation, citing reasons such as a hostile work environment and inappropriate mentality towards user funds. Dunn accused Pump.fun of several crimes, including operating as an unregistered securities exchange and casino, alongside suggestions of child abuse intentions. The former Pump.fun employee was immediately arrested but soon released on bail. In October 2024, Jarett Dunn pleaded guilty to the crypto theft but soon requested to withdraw this plea while awaiting sentencing. This action resulted in Dunn losing his legal team while under a strict bail condition that involved movement restriction. However, in June 2025, Jarett Dunn breached this bail agreement in a sudden, unauthorized move from London to Liverpool while also tampering with his ankle monitor. The ex-Pump.fun developer was soon apprehended and now sits in a London prison awaiting a hearing. According to recent posts on Dunn’s X account under the alias @STACCoverflow, the Canadian appears to have made peace with staying in prison, hinting at accepting the guilty plea again and terminating his withdrawal request. @STACCoverflow is reportedly managed by Dunn’s friend Mark Kelly, who has reportedly been communicating with the developer since his recent incarceration. Dunn Stares At 10-Year Sentence While Pump.fun Celebrates ICO In the UK, fraud by abuse of position where the value exceeds £500,000 ($640,000) can result in a maximum sentence of 10 years. While a bail breach attracts remand in prison until hearing or an additional 12 months’ jail time if prosecuted as a separate offence. However, such factors as an early guilty plea and purported health issues may help mitigate sentences in the case of Jarett Dunn. Meanwhile, Pump.fun just recently concluded its initial coin offering (ICO) process, raising about $600 million in the process.

Trump Jr.’s $4M investment and new U.S. crypto laws add momentum to Thumzup’s expansion strategy. XRP hits $3.65 as Thumzup shares rise 267% since January, fueling investor interest in digital assets. Thumzup Expands Crypto Holdings Beyond Bitcoin Thumzup Media Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed firm, has approved a $250 million investment plan to expand its cryptocurrency holdings. The board of the company approved the strategy, and it will incorporate the digital assets, including XRP, USDC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and LTC. The company previously held only Bitcoin, with 19 BTC valued at around $2.3 million. The new strategy will be based on creating a more diversified portfolio. Meanwhile, the strategy implies the transition of a single-asset exposure to a wider variety of tokens. The company will allocate depending on market conditions and internal risk rules. CEO Points to U.S. Policy Shifts and Market Access Chief Executive Robert Steele said the decision comes as the U.S. moves closer to regulatory clarity for digital assets. “As the U.S. federal government moves toward more crypto-friendly policies and greater regulatory clarity, Thumzup is committed to remaining at the forefront of this transformative technology,” he said . Steele also commented on the company’s long-term outlook. “By diversifying our portfolio of cryptocurrencies to gain wider exposure to the market as a whole, we believe Thumzup is optimally positioned to create value for TZUP shareholders,” he said. The timing follows the introduction of two recent crypto bills, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act. Trump Jr. Investment and Trading Activity Drive Momentum The move follows an earlier announcement that Donald Trump Jr. acquired 350,000 shares in Thumzup Media, valued at around $4 million. He and his brother Eric are listed as advisors to Dominari Securities, which recently arranged a $6 million private placement in the company. Thumzup shares are now trading at $12.59, based on Google Finance data. The stock has gained 84% over the past month and is up 267% since January.
