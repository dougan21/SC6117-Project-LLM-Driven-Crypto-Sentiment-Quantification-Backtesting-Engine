Have you ever wondered who truly holds the reins in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency? While retail investors make headlines, the quiet movements of significant players often dictate the market’s pulse. Recent data reveals a fascinating trend: Bitcoin whales , those colossal holders of digital wealth, have been on an extraordinary accumulation spree. This isn’t just a minor blip; it’s a strategic maneuver that could reshape the market’s trajectory. Let’s dive deep into what this means for Bitcoin and its future. The Unprecedented Surge: How Much Are Bitcoin Whales Accumulating? According to insights from Santiment, a leading on-chain analytics firm, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 Bitcoin (BTC) have collectively amassed a staggering 218,570 BTC since late March. To put that into perspective, this represents a significant chunk of the total Bitcoin supply being scooped up by a relatively small group of entities. These large holders now command an impressive 68.44% of the entire circulating Bitcoin supply. Magnitude of Accumulation: Over 218,000 BTC acquired in a short span. Dominance: These wallets now control nearly 70% of Bitcoin’s total supply. Timeframe: The accumulation phase began in late March, suggesting a strategic entry point. This substantial accumulation by Bitcoin whales is more than just a statistic; it’s a powerful indicator of confidence. When entities with such deep pockets decide to increase their holdings, it often signals a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, potentially hinting at an impending price surge or a perceived market bottom. Why Do Bitcoin Whales Accumulate? Decoding Their Strategic Moves Understanding the motivations behind the actions of Bitcoin whales is crucial for any market participant. These aren’t impulsive decisions; they are calculated plays based on extensive research, market analysis, and a long-term vision. Several factors could be driving this current accumulation: 1. Long-Term Conviction and Halving Anticipation Many Bitcoin whales are long-term holders, often referred to as ‘HODLers’ (Hold On for Dear Life). They view Bitcoin as digital gold and a hedge against inflation. The recent accumulation could be a pre-halving strategy, anticipating the supply shock and potential price appreciation that historically follows Bitcoin’s halving events. 2. Institutional Inflows and ETF Impact The approval and subsequent success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in various regions have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. Large corporations, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds are now able to gain exposure to Bitcoin more easily. Some of these institutional players could be contributing to the whale accumulation, either directly or through their custodians. 3. Macroeconomic Uncertainty and Risk Aversion In times of global economic instability, rising inflation, and geopolitical tensions, traditional assets might seem less appealing. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and limited supply, is increasingly seen as a safe haven asset by sophisticated investors. Bitcoin whales might be accumulating to de-risk their portfolios from traditional financial systems. 4. Anticipation of Future Innovation and Adoption Beyond price, whales often invest in the underlying technology and ecosystem. They might be anticipating significant advancements in Bitcoin’s scalability (e.g., Lightning Network), increased utility, or broader global adoption, positioning themselves to benefit from future growth. The Ripple Effect: How Do Bitcoin Whales Influence Market Dynamics? The movements of Bitcoin whales have a profound impact on the broader cryptocurrency market. Their actions can create significant ripple effects, influencing price, liquidity, and overall market sentiment. Price Volatility and Liquidity When whales accumulate, they remove significant amounts of Bitcoin from exchanges, reducing the available supply and potentially driving up prices if demand remains constant or increases. Conversely, if a large whale decides to sell, it can flood the market with supply, leading to sharp price drops. This creates volatility, which can be both an opportunity and a risk for smaller investors. Market Sentiment and Confidence The accumulation trend by Bitcoin whales often acts as a bullish signal for the market. When retail investors see large players buying, it instills confidence and can encourage more buying activity, creating a positive feedback loop. This collective sentiment can push prices higher, demonstrating the psychological impact of whale movements. Understanding Market Cycles Whales often buy during periods of market fear or consolidation, when prices are relatively low, and sell during periods of euphoria when prices are high. This contrarian approach allows them to maximize profits. Their current accumulation suggests they might perceive the current market conditions as an opportune ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whales-accumulation-signal/,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|RESEARCH,Crypto News|$BTC|BITCOIN|Crypto|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Market Analysis,BTC,"Bitcoin Whales’ Astounding Accumulation: A Bullish Signal?.

2025-07-31 05:55:10+00:00,US Cryptocurrency Official Bo Hines Makes Critical Statements: Discusses the Future of Bitcoin and Altcoins,"Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House Digital Assets Advisory Council, released a comprehensive new digital asset report today on Fox Business, in line with President Trump’s campaign promise to make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.” Hines stated that the 160-page report prepared by the working group formed by President Trump to support digital asset markets provides a clear framework for the industry and will provide long-term regulatory stability. “We see our job as fulfilling the President''s promises. We will make the United States a global superpower in digital assets,” Hines said. Hines argued that the cryptocurrency sector has been “suppressed” over the past fifteen years, especially under the Biden administration, saying, “This sector has been devastated. But now, by removing bureaucratic hurdles, we are moving into a new construction process.” Stating that the new period will progress in three main stages, Hines listed them as follows: Disruption – Dismantling Operation Chokepoint 2.0 and ending financial access restrictions. Construction – Implementation of stablecoin regulation with the new law called the “Genius Act.” Implementation – Implementation of new market structure regulations, including tax reforms and consumer protection policies. Hines also addressed widespread concerns about cryptocurrencies being used for illicit activities. “Blockchain provides transparency,” he said. “Using blockchain to perpetrate crime is foolish because all transactions can be traced.” Related News: BREAKING: Fed Chairman Jerome Powell Makes Statement Following Interest Rate Decision - LIVE Hines stated that the prepared report will guide the “Clarity Act” and other market structure laws currently being debated in Congress, and that these documents are expected to reach President Trump''s desk by October. Contributors to the report included former SEC member Paul Atkins, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bassett, and technology consultant David Sacks. Bassett wrote in an article for the Washington Post that President Trump''s “blockchain-friendly approach” would transform the US into a crypto superpower. The Trump administration views crypto assets not just as financial instruments but as symbols of American innovation. “The US is on its way to becoming a leader in Bitcoin and digital financial technologies,” Hines said. *This is not investment advice.

Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Final Leg Is Near – Time To Be ‘Cautiously Optimistic’? Ethereum Hits 10-Year Milestone Ethereum and the crypto community are celebrating the blockchain’s 10th anniversary by highlighting some of the ecosystem’s key events since 2015, like the ICO craze, the non-fungible tokensFT boom, The Merge, and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In an X post, Unchained host Laura Shin listed some of Ethereum’s milestones, including its first spot in client diversity, Total Value Locked (TVL), and the number of ecosystem developers. Shin also emphasized the network’s 100% uptime rate during the last 10 years. One of Ethereum’s developers, Lefteris Karapetsas, commemorated the anniversary by sharing some pictures from July 30, 2015, stating, “We were a small team of hackers in an office in Kreuzberg in Berlin and we had just launched the Ethereum network. The rest is history. Looking back at the last 10 years, I am excited about the next 10 years, the next 25, the next 100.” Meanwhile, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong revealed how the US immigration system technically “contributed” to Ethereum’s creation: Fun fact: I met @vitalikbuterin in 2013 at the San Jose Bitcoin conference when he was writing for Bitcoin Magazine (his writing was great). A few months later I invited him to come by Coinbase’s first office in San Francisco for a visit and he showed us some cool stuff on his laptop. Armstrong explained that he tried to hire Vitalik Buterin in 2013, but due to a series of circumstances, including problems obtaining a US work Visa, Buterin was forced to return to Canada. “While he was stuck in Canada, he created Ethereum,” the CEO detailed, “So, in a way, the sub-optimal immigration system in the U.S. contributed to the creation of Ethereum.” Bankless co-founder David Hoffman jokingly replied that “Coinbase almost prevented Ethereum from ever happening.” ETH’s Birthday Fun Delayed? On its birthday, ETH started the day trying to reclaim the $3,800 mark, which some analysts consider the “last major resistance” before new highs. The King of Altcoins has been attempting to successfully break out from this level for over a week, with two failed attempts during this timeframe. At the start of the week, the cryptocurrency briefly surged above this level, hitting a seven-month high of $3,941 on Monday. However, the recent market pullback sent Ethereum back inside its local range. During the Wednesday celebrations, ETH’s price suffered 4% drop to the $3,680 area, fueled by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announcement of its decision to leave interest rates unchanged. Nonetheless, it quickly recovered from the initial market reaction, which saw liquidations worth $212 million in just 60 minutes.

The plea agreement, entered Wednesday, spares the pair from a more serious money laundering charge that carried a potential 20-year sentence. Court documents show that William Lonergan Hill and Keonne Rodriguez, who had previously pleaded not guilty, changed their pleas in the Southern District of New York. Under the agreement, the US Department of Justice dropped the money laundering count, leaving only the charge of running an unlicensed money-transmitting business , which carries a maximum sentence of five years. @SamouraiWallet founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Hill are set to reverse their plea to “guilty” in a high-profile crypto privacy case, according to New York court filings. #SamouraiWallet #CryptoMixers https://t.co/8aHVgJKESf — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 30, 2025 Samourai Founders Accused of Marketing Platform as Money Laundering Tool The DoJ and FBI shut down Samourai Wallet in 2024. They also arrested the two founders. Authorities alleged that the service knowingly enabled criminals to hide illicit funds. Moreover, prosecutors said the platform laundered over $100m. They added that it was actively marketed as a tool for large-scale money laundering and sanctions evasion. Samourai Wallet was a popular coin mixing app that allowed users to obscure the flow of their crypto transactions. These services combine multiple transactions together, making it harder to trace funds on a public blockchain.

Yet, a remarkable shift is underway in Latin America. In a move that has sent ripples across the global financial landscape, Bolivia’s central bank has reportedly declared cryptocurrency a reliable alternative to traditional fiat currencies. This isn’t just a casual statement; it signifies a monumental change in perspective, particularly for a nation that has previously expressed skepticism towards digital assets. This unexpected embrace, coupled with a strategic partnership with El Salvador, the trailblazing nation that made Bitcoin legal tender, sets the stage for a fascinating chapter in Bolivia crypto adoption . Bolivia’s Pivotal Shift: Embracing a Digital Future For years, central banks worldwide have approached cryptocurrencies with caution, often citing concerns about volatility and illicit activities. Bolivia was no exception, having previously issued warnings against their use. This makes the recent declaration from Bolivia’s central bank all the more significant. By calling crypto a “reliable alternative,” they are not just acknowledging its existence but recognizing its potential utility and stability in the financial ecosystem. What could be behind this dramatic change of heart? Nations globally are grappling with economic pressures, inflation, and the need for more efficient cross-border transactions. Cryptocurrencies offer a decentralized, borderless, and often deflationary alternative to traditional systems. For a country like Bolivia, exploring such alternatives could be a strategic move to: Enhance Financial Inclusion: Provide access to modern financial services for unbanked populations. Mitigate Inflationary Pressures: Offer citizens a hedge against potential local currency depreciation. Streamline Remittances: Reduce costs and speed up international money transfers. Attract Investment: Position the country as forward-thinking, potentially drawing in foreign capital. This declaration lays the groundwork for practical implementation and integration of digital assets into Bolivia’s financial fabric, signaling a willingness to learn, adapt, and potentially pioneer new economic models within the region. The El Salvador Connection: A Blueprint for Bolivia Crypto Adoption Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Bolivia’s announcement is its direct link to El Salvador. According to Cointelegraph, Bolivia’s central bank signed an agreement with El Salvador to jointly promote crypto adoption and develop related policies. This partnership is a game-changer. El Salvador made history in September 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Its journey, while not without its challenges, has provided invaluable real-world data and experience regarding national-level cryptocurrency integration. El Salvador’s experience offers a unique blueprint. They have: Developed a National Wallet: Facilitated Bitcoin transactions for citizens. Invested in Bitcoin Mining: Utilizing geothermal energy for sustainable crypto practices. Created a Legal Framework: Established laws governing Bitcoin as legal tender. Promoted Education: Initiated programs to educate citizens on cryptocurrency use. For Bolivia, collaborating with El Salvador means gaining direct access to this pioneering experience. Instead of starting from scratch, Bolivia can leverage El Salvador’s insights, learn from its successes and failures, and tailor policies that best suit its unique economic and social landscape. This collaboration could manifest in joint research, shared expertise in regulatory frameworks, and coordinated public education efforts. This alliance underscores a growing regional interest in exploring digital assets, not as speculative tools, but as fundamental components of future economies. The synergy between a nation embracing a “reliable alternative” and another that has already implemented it as legal tender creates a powerful force for Bolivia crypto adoption . Why Nations Are Seriously Looking at Crypto: Beyond the Hype The shift in Bolivia’s stance, mirroring a broader trend, prompts a deeper look into why sovereign nations are increasingly considering cryptocurrencies.

2025-07-31 06:15:10+00:00,Decoding BTC Perpetual Futures: A Critical Look at 24-Hour Long-Short Ratios,"BitcoinWorld Decoding BTC Perpetual Futures: A Critical Look at 24-Hour Long-Short Ratios In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency trading, understanding market sentiment is paramount. For traders engaged with BTC perpetual futures , the ability to gauge the collective mood of the market can be the difference between anticipating trends and being caught off guard. Today, we delve into a crucial indicator: the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures across major exchanges. This data offers a snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves, providing invaluable insights into potential market movements. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios: A Foundation for Traders Before we dive into the numbers, let’s establish a clear understanding of what BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios represent. Essentially, this metric compares the number of long positions (bets that the price of Bitcoin will increase) against the number of short positions (bets that the price will decrease) over a specific period, in this case, 24 hours. Perpetual futures contracts are a popular derivative in crypto, allowing traders to speculate on Bitcoin’s price without an expiry date, making these ratios a continuous reflection of sentiment. Long Positions: Traders buying perpetual futures contracts, anticipating a price rise. Short Positions: Traders selling perpetual futures contracts, anticipating a price fall. The Ratio: A higher long percentage suggests bullish sentiment, while a higher short percentage indicates bearish sentiment. This ratio is a powerful tool because it directly reflects the conviction of traders. When a significant majority leans one way, it can signal an impending move or, conversely, a potential reversal if the market becomes overly stretched in one direction. Decoding the 24-Hour BTC Perpetual Futures Landscape: What Do the Numbers Say? Let’s examine the aggregated 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios across various cryptocurrency exchanges. This overarching view provides a broad stroke of market sentiment. Total Market Sentiment (Past 24 Hours): Position Type Percentage Long 48.92% Short 51.08% The total data reveals a slight bearish bias, with short positions outweighing long positions by a narrow margin. This indicates that, on aggregate, more traders are currently betting on a downward movement for Bitcoin’s price in the perpetual futures market. However, the closeness of the percentages suggests a relatively balanced, albeit slightly cautious, market. Exchange-Specific Insights: Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment While the aggregate data offers a general overview, it’s often more insightful to look at individual exchanges. Different platforms cater to different types of traders, and their specific long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures can reveal unique pockets of sentiment or trading strategies. Top Three Exchanges (Past 24 Hours): Exchange Long % Short % Binance 48.72% 51.28% Bybit 48.55% 51.45% Gate.io 50.41% 49.59% Let’s break down these figures: Binance: As one of the largest exchanges, Binance’s data often reflects broader market sentiment. Its ratio of 48.72% long and 51.28% short mirrors the overall market’s slight bearish tilt, indicating that a significant portion of its active BTC perpetual futures traders are leaning short. This could suggest caution among its vast user base. Bybit: Bybit shows an even stronger short bias at 51.45% compared to 48.55% long. This platform is known for its derivatives trading, and a more pronounced short position here might indicate that its professional and active traders are more aggressively positioning for a downside move in Bitcoin. Gate.io: In contrast to Binance and Bybit, Gate.io presents a slightly bullish sentiment, with 50.41% long and 49.59% short. This subtle divergence suggests that traders on Gate.io might be more optimistic or are employing different strategies compared to their counterparts on other major exchanges. This could be due to a different user demographic or specific trading opportunities perceived on the platform. The varied sentiment across these exchanges highlights the importance of not just looking at aggregated data, but also understanding the nuances of different trading environments when analyzing BTC perpetual futures . Navigating Market Sentiment: How to Leverage BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios in Your Strategy So, how can you use these BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios to inform your trading decisions? While they are not a standalone crystal ball, they offer valuable context: Identifying Overextension: When the ratio is heavily skewed in one direction (e.g., 70% long or 70% short), it can signal an overextension. An overwhelmingly long ratio might precede a liquidation cascade if the price drops, as longs get squeezed. Conversely, an extreme short ratio could indicate a potential short squeeze if the price unexpectedly rises.

This indicates that, on aggregate, more traders are currently betting on a downward movement for Bitcoin’s price in the perpetual futures market. However, the closeness of the percentages suggests a relatively balanced, albeit slightly cautious, market. Exchange-Specific Insights: Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment While the aggregate data offers a general overview, it’s often more insightful to look at individual exchanges. Different platforms cater to different types of traders, and their specific long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures can reveal unique pockets of sentiment or trading strategies. Top Three Exchanges (Past 24 Hours): Exchange Long % Short % Binance 48.72% 51.28% Bybit 48.55% 51.45% Gate.io 50.41% 49.59% Let’s break down these figures: Binance: As one of the largest exchanges, Binance’s data often reflects broader market sentiment. Its ratio of 48.72% long and 51.28% short mirrors the overall market’s slight bearish tilt, indicating that a significant portion of its active BTC perpetual futures traders are leaning short. This could suggest caution among its vast user base. Bybit: Bybit shows an even stronger short bias at 51.45% compared to 48.55% long. This platform is known for its derivatives trading, and a more pronounced short position here might indicate that its professional and active traders are more aggressively positioning for a downside move in Bitcoin. Gate.io: In contrast to Binance and Bybit, Gate.io presents a slightly bullish sentiment, with 50.41% long and 49.59% short. This subtle divergence suggests that traders on Gate.io might be more optimistic or are employing different strategies compared to their counterparts on other major exchanges. This could be due to a different user demographic or specific trading opportunities perceived on the platform. The varied sentiment across these exchanges highlights the importance of not just looking at aggregated data, but also understanding the nuances of different trading environments when analyzing BTC perpetual futures . Navigating Market Sentiment: How to Leverage BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios in Your Strategy So, how can you use these BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios to inform your trading decisions? While they are not a standalone crystal ball, they offer valuable context: Identifying Overextension: When the ratio is heavily skewed in one direction (e.g., 70% long or 70% short), it can signal an overextension. An overwhelmingly long ratio might precede a liquidation cascade if the price drops, as longs get squeezed. Conversely, an extreme short ratio could indicate a potential short squeeze if the price unexpectedly rises. Confirming Trends:"

2025-07-31 07:00:09+00:00,Investors Are Dumping Bitcoin for These 3 Cryptocurrencies Here''s The Key Info,"Investors are shifting their focus from Bitcoin to other digital currencies. This trend highlights emerging cryptocurrencies gaining traction in the market. These alternatives are capturing interest and showing potential for significant growth. Discover which three coins are attracting attention and why they might be the next big thing in the crypto world. Cardano''s Volatile Past and Firm Key Levels Guide Trading Cardano posted a notable 36.33% increase over the past month despite an 18% fall over the last six months. Price movements showed bursts of recovery amid longer-term weakness. The recent surge contrasts with a prolonged trend of decline, making the coin prone to sharp swings. Historical trends indicate that short-term gains may not suffice to reverse the downward momentum observed in the half-year timeframe. The coin''s price history reflects periods of rapid optimism followed by intervals of selling pressure. Understanding both the recent recovery and the extended downtrend is crucial when analyzing Cardano’s performance. Cardano is currently trading between $0.48 and $0.70. The nearest resistance stands at $0.83, with a secondary resistance at $1.05. On the downside, support is marked at $0.38 and stronger support at $0.163. Indicators show mixed signals, with the Awesome Oscillator reading modestly positive and the Momentum Indicator at -0.069. The Relative Strength Index at 55.12 suggests a neutral market. Bulls are cautiously testing higher resistance levels while bears exert pressure. No clear trend prevails as the market oscillates between key levels. Traders might consider entering positions on a breakout above $0.83 or initiating buys at the $0.38 support level. Solana Price Trends Point to Key Trading Levels Solana showed an 18.71% gain over the past month, marking a notable short-term improvement despite a challenging overall environment. Over the past six months, the coin slipped by 23.67%, indicating persistent downward pressure affecting its longer-term performance. Price moves have oscillated between $131 and $173.35, reflecting volatility that has kept traders alert. Recent performance highlights a recovery phase accompanied by sporadic corrections, with earlier rallies giving way to market caution. The mixed behavior over these periods underscores the coin’s sensitivity to both bullish spurts and bearish setbacks, leaving investors to weigh short-term gains against broader downturn risks. Current price action centers between clear support and resistance levels, with the nearest support at $107.89 and immediate resistance at $191.79. A secondary support at $65.94 and further resistance at $233.74 expand the trading range. Momentum remains moderate with an indicator of 0.52 and an RSI of 56.03, suggesting that neither side has full command. Oscillations prevent a clear trend, keeping buyers and sellers in close contests. Trading ideas include watching for moves above $191.79 to signal a bullish push or declines below $107.89 to indicate renewed pressure. Participants may consider buying near support with tight stops to guard against volatility while trying to capture short-term swings. Ethereum Market Update: 1-Month Surge and Key Support/Resistance Levels Ethereum has experienced a noticeable rise over the past month with gains of 52.82%, reflecting a short-term burst of investor enthusiasm. The six-month increase of 17.65% points to steady appreciation over a longer period, highlighting a phase of both volatility and consolidation. Price behavior has shown a dynamic response to shifting market sentiment, where relative strength for the past month clearly indicates an accelerated recovery compared to the more measured growth seen over half a year. Trading volumes and market engagement have contributed to the asset''s sustained performance, allowing traders to witness both rapid advances and moderate long-term gains. Currently, Ethereum is trading within a range of $2110 to $2870, with a notable resistance level around $3254 and a secondary hurdle at $4013. Support is clearly visible at approximately $1735, with deeper support emerging near $975. Bullish momentum is prominent, though bears remain cautious and alert for any pullback. Traders may explore long positions if the price holds above immediate support, while monitoring resistance for exits. The lack of a clearly defined trend makes precise observation of these levels essential, as strategic trades within this range could capture gains during potential reversals or further advances. Conclusion Investors are turning to ADA , SOL , and ETH as they seek new opportunities in the crypto market. ADA attracts attention with its strong development team and innovative features. Sol is favored for its fast transaction speeds and lower costs. ETH continues to be a trusted option due to its robust network and wide adoption.

In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, such an event isn’t just a fantasy – it’s a reality that recently unfolded, captivating the attention of enthusiasts and analysts alike. The activation of a long-dormant Bitcoin wallet, holding a staggering 50 BTC valued at $5.91 million, after 15.3 years of inactivity, has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape. This isn’t just about a large sum of money; it’s a profound reminder of Bitcoin’s early days and the incredible journey it has taken. What Just Happened with This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet? The crypto community was abuzz following a report from the blockchain tracker, Whale Alert, renowned for monitoring significant cryptocurrency movements. Their Telegram channel announced the activation of a Bitcoin address that had remained untouched since April 2009. To put that into perspective, Bitcoin itself was only launched in January 2009. This means the Dormant Bitcoin Wallet in question was created and funded within months of Bitcoin’s genesis, making its contents truly historic. The Asset: 50 Bitcoins (BTC) Current Value: Approximately $5.91 million (at the time of activation) Dormancy Period: 15.3 years Original Funding Date: April 2009 (just three months after Bitcoin’s launch) Source of Report: Blockchain tracker Whale Alert The Enduring Mystery: Who Owns This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet? Whenever a significant Dormant Bitcoin Wallet springs to life after such a prolonged period, the immediate question on everyone’s mind is: ‘Who is behind this activation?’ The possibilities are numerous and intriguing, each painting a different picture of the early days of crypto adoption. Early Adopter or Visionary: It could belong to an individual who recognized Bitcoin’s potential in its infancy, acquired coins when they were virtually worthless, and then simply forgot about them or decided to hold them for an extremely long term. This person might have resurfaced after rediscovering old keys or deciding the time was finally right. Lost Keys, Now Found: One of the most common tales in the crypto world involves lost private keys. Thousands, if not millions, of Bitcoins are believed to be inaccessible due to misplaced or destroyed wallets. The activation of this Dormant Bitcoin Wallet could be a rare success story of someone meticulously searching and finally recovering their access. The Satoshi Theory: While highly speculative, some might even wonder if it’s connected to Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, or one of the very first miners. Wallets from Bitcoin’s earliest days are often scrutinized for any potential link to Satoshi’s known addresses, though this specific wallet hasn’t been definitively linked. Institutional or Early Developer Fund: Less likely for such an early wallet, but it could potentially be a fund belonging to an early developer or a small group, now being consolidated or moved for various reasons. Why Activate a Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Now, After So Long? The timing of this activation is as fascinating as the dormancy itself. After 15 years of silence, what prompted the owner of this Dormant Bitcoin Wallet to finally make a move? Several factors could be at play: Peak Market Conditions: Bitcoin has recently seen significant price surges, nearing all-time highs. This elevated value could have incentivized the owner to finally access their long-forgotten fortune, perhaps to realize profits or diversify their holdings. Financial Need or Planning: Life circumstances change. The owner might have a new financial goal, a large investment, or a personal need that requires access to such a substantial sum. Rediscovery of Access: As mentioned, the simplest explanation is often the most plausible. The owner might have stumbled upon an old hard drive, a forgotten paper wallet, or recovered a seed phrase that had been lost for years. The effort involved in recovering such a wallet after so long would likely be immense. Security Consolidation: With advancements in wallet security and cold storage solutions, the owner might be moving their funds from an older, potentially less secure address to a more robust, modern storage method. This is a common practice for large holders. Estate Planning: In some cases, these activations occur as part of estate planning or inheritance processes, where beneficiaries finally gain access to digital assets after the original owner’s passing. The Profound Significance of Dormant Bitcoin Wallet Activations The activation of this particular Dormant Bitcoin Wallet is more than just a news headline; it carries significant weight for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In a new YouTube update, Gromen says that the US will likely address its growing $36 trillion national debt by printing more money, which debases the dollar, rather than allowing Treasury yields to soar to try and attract investors. “Now the credit risk is at the Treasury market level, except Treasuries have no credit risk. The government can always just print the money to make interest payments and avoid default. So there’s no credit risk in Treasuries, there’s only inflation risk. In my opinion, what we’re seeing in Bitcoin treasury companies, particularly, is logical in light of this primrose path that we’ve followed over the last 25 years, as more and more people begin to realize that the only way out of this is severe devaluation of US debt, of US sovereign debt, of Western sovereign debt. In that case, I would expect credit spreads to remain relatively low, because all else equal, I’d rather own an Apple bond or a Microsoft bond than a US Treasury bond.” Gromen also says the US may be facing an Argentina-style economic future, a reference to the South American country’s problems of high inflation and devaluation of its local currency. “And now huge caveat, unless the US government ever decides, even for a period of time, to stand aside and let the Treasury market dysfunction, but then you’re going to get credit spreads to really blow out as we’ve seen. The credit risks of everything goes to the moon, except for probably gold in that case, to be honest. But again, I don’t think that’s going to be allowed to happen for more than a few weeks, few days at a time. Ultimately, I think what we are watching … is something we’ve long called for to happen and referred to as Argentina with US characteristics, or US with Argentina characteristics, however you want to phrase it. Stocks are up this year in dollars. They’re down in gold, in Bitcoin. We’re seeing pressure from the President’s administration on the central bank [chairman] because they need interest rates down to be able to afford the debt, to be able to reduce the interest expense, to reduce the fiscal pressures.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Robert “Bo” Hines, the executive director of the US President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, reaffirmed the initiative during an appearance on the Crypto in America show. “We do believe in accumulation,” Hines stated when asked directly about the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He emphasized that such a reserve “has been established,” and also referenced a broader national digital assets stockpile. According to Hines, Bitcoin holds a unique position in the digital asset space. “Bitcoin is in a class of its own and everyone recognizes that,” he said. Infrastructure Taking Shape Behind the Scenes While critics noted the lack of mention of a Bitcoin reserve in the recently released White House report, Hines assured the public that efforts are still underway. He explained that establishing the necessary infrastructure requires careful planning and significant labor. “There are countless ways that we can accumulate,” he said. “I think that people will be very pleased with the direction that we are going, and we’ll start moving on that in short order.” The administration, he added, also wants to “give credence” to innovation across other blockchain ecosystems, though no specific altcoins or projects were named.

However, the document made no reference to a strategic Bitcoin reserve.

2025-07-31 07:40:11+00:00,Bitcoin Reserve: U.S. Unveils Pivotal Strategy for Digital Asset Leadership,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserve: U.S. Unveils Pivotal Strategy for Digital Asset Leadership The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and recent news from the U.S. signals a monumental shift in how nations might view and utilize cryptocurrencies. Imagine a future where a country’s financial stability isn’t solely tied to gold or fiat currency, but also to a decentralized digital asset. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the emerging reality, as the U.S. digital assets council has unequivocally reaffirmed its commitment to establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve . This move isn’t just a nod to innovation; it’s a profound statement about the future of global finance and the foundational role Bitcoin is poised to play. Understanding the Vision Behind a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve What exactly does it mean for a nation to build a strategic Bitcoin reserve ? At its core, it signifies a government’s decision to accumulate and hold a significant quantity of Bitcoin (BTC) as a national asset. This isn’t merely about investment; it’s about strategic positioning in a rapidly digitizing global economy. The U.S. President Donald Trump’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, under the astute leadership of Robert “Bo” Hines, has been at the forefront of this groundbreaking initiative. Hines, in an interview with Crypto in America, underscored the administration’s deep conviction in BTC accumulation, emphasizing that a national digital asset stockpile is already taking shape. The rationale behind such a bold move is multi-faceted, aiming to: Diversify National Assets: Moving beyond traditional reserves like gold and foreign currencies. Hedge Against Inflation: Utilizing Bitcoin’s perceived scarcity as a potential store of value. Foster Innovation: Solidifying the U.S.’s position as a leader in digital asset technology and policy. Enhance Geopolitical Leverage: Gaining influence in the emerging digital economy. The Official Mandate: Authorizing the Bitcoin Reserve This commitment isn’t just talk; it’s backed by official action. The strategic Bitcoin reserve was formally authorized through an executive order signed in March. This critical directive laid the groundwork for what promises to be a transformative period in U.S. economic and technological policy. The authorization signals a clear intent from the highest levels of government to integrate digital assets, particularly Bitcoin, into the national financial framework. It’s a testament to the growing recognition of Bitcoin’s unique properties as a foundational asset, distinct from other digital currencies. Robert “Bo” Hines highlighted that Bitcoin is seen not just as another digital asset, but as something unique and foundational. This distinction is crucial, suggesting that the U.S. government views BTC with a special significance, perhaps akin to how gold has been historically valued for its scarcity and decentralized nature. Building the Framework: Infrastructure and Regulation for the Bitcoin Reserve With the authorization in place, the administration’s current focus has shifted to the intricate task of developing the necessary infrastructure and regulatory framework. This is no small feat, as it involves navigating complex technical, legal, and economic challenges. Establishing a robust and secure system for managing a national Bitcoin reserve requires: Secure Custody Solutions: Ensuring the safety of substantial BTC holdings from cyber threats and unauthorized access. Regulatory Clarity: Developing clear guidelines for the acquisition, management, and potential deployment of these assets. Interoperability: Creating systems that can seamlessly interact with existing financial infrastructures. Risk Management: Implementing strategies to mitigate volatility and other market risks associated with Bitcoin. The goal is clear: to support long-term leadership in the digital assets space. This isn’t about short-term gains but about establishing a sustainable foundation for the U.S. to remain at the forefront of global financial innovation for decades to come. Why a National Bitcoin Reserve Matters: Benefits and Opportunities The establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve carries significant potential benefits, both domestically and on the global stage. These advantages extend beyond mere financial gains, touching upon national security, economic resilience, and technological advancement. Economic Resilience and Diversification In an increasingly uncertain global economic climate, diversifying national reserves becomes paramount. Traditional fiat currencies are susceptible to inflation and geopolitical pressures. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and capped supply, offers a potential hedge.

2025-07-31 07:50:15+00:00,"Bitcoin Whales Seize 68% of Supply After Adding 218,570 BTC","Bitcoin’s largest stakeholders are quietly tightening their grip on the market. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated 218,570 BTC since late March, boosting their control to more than 68% of the asset’s total supply. This deep-pocketed buying spree comes as Bitcoin consolidates near $118,000, with analysts increasingly convinced that the next major price surge will be driven by patient capital rather than retail speculation. Building a Stronger Base In a July 31 post on X, Santiment highlighted a strategic shift, with nearly 0.9% of Bitcoin’s supply moving into the hands of whales over the past four months, reinforcing long-term accumulation trends. It matches a wider structural rotation in the asset’s ownership. As reported by CryptoPotato , institutional players are steadily replacing early adopters in what BTC financial services provider Swan calls “the largest holder rotation in Bitcoin’s history.” This rotation was tested last week when a Satoshi-era whale dumped about 80,000 BTC, worth more than $9 billion, briefly pushing down prices from $119,000 to around $115,000. Still, the market soaked up the sale with minimal disruption, which Swan argued was a show of BTC’s “maturity” and resilience. Many observers now believe this transition is the foundation for a more stable, capital-driven bull market, one they expect will be less affected by euphoric spikes and abrupt collapses. Meanwhile, BTC’s current trading range between $115,000 and $119,500 is being viewed as healthy consolidation. According to a recent report from CryptoQuant, the market “overheating” seen lately has been markedly milder than past cycles, suggesting any near-term pullback could be shallow and short-lived. Market Consolidating The flagship cryptocurrency is currently trading at $118,700, barely moving in the last 24 hours after only managing a 0.4% rise. The story is pretty much the same across seven days, with the asset creeping to a 0.8% increase in that period. However, it is up by a more respectable 11% over 30 days, with a key resistance level emerging above $120,000. A recent Glassnode report warned that a break below $115,000 could expose a thin liquidity gap down to $110,000. However, if the OG crypto pushes past $125,000, it could supply the juice for a run to $141,000. For now, whales seem content to accumulate during this consolidation phase. Their steady buying, coupled with the ongoing transfer of BTC from older holders to institutional giants, points to a maturing market preparing for its next leg up.

Bitcoin’s largest stakeholders are quietly tightening their grip on the market. According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have accumulated 218,570 BTC since late March, boosting their control to more than 68% of the asset’s total supply. This deep-pocketed buying spree comes as Bitcoin consolidates near $118,000, with analysts increasingly convinced that the next major price surge will be driven by patient capital rather than retail speculation. Building a Stronger Base In a July 31 post on X, Santiment highlighted a strategic shift, with nearly 0.9% of Bitcoin’s supply moving into the hands of whales over the past four months, reinforcing long-term accumulation trends. It matches a wider structural rotation in the asset’s ownership. As reported by CryptoPotato , institutional players are steadily replacing early adopters in what BTC financial services provider Swan calls “the largest holder rotation in Bitcoin’s history.” This rotation was tested last week when a Satoshi-era whale dumped about 80,000 BTC, worth more than $9 billion, briefly pushing down prices from $119,000 to around $115,000.

2025-07-31 08:00:31+00:00,Charles Hoskinson Backs ADA as Bitcoin’s DeFi Layer: Is Cardano Set to Outperform BTC?,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has made one of the most ambitious predictions yet for ADA, stating that the token could surge to between $80 and $800. In a recent interview with Blockworks , Hoskinson proposed that ADA could become the yield-generating layer for Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem, opening new doors for utility and investor returns. Unlike Bitcoin, which is widely regarded as a store of value, Cardano offers real-world functionality. Hoskinson emphasized that ADA holders already benefit from staking rewards and ecosystem token incentives, something Bitcoin lacks in its passive holding model. “Cardano does substantially more and will end up being the yield layer of Bitcoin DeFi,” he noted, adding that ADA could grow by 100x or even 1000x in the coming years. ADA vs BTC: A Battle of Performance and Utility Historically, Cardano (ADA) has had moments of strong performance. In late 2024, it outperformed Bitcoin by 160%. But by mid-2025, the momentum shifted as ADA lagged behind. That trend began to reverse in June, when ADA gained nearly 30% more than BTC. Still, on a long-term scale since 2021, ADA remains 88% down against Bitcoin. Market dynamics show mixed sentiment. Short-term metrics like the spot taker CVD reveal increased selling pressure. However, ADA’s realized cap recently climbed from $23.4B to $23.6B, indicating renewed investor confidence despite market turbulence. Will Integration with Bitcoin’s DeFi Increase Cardano’s Market Appeal? Hoskinson’s proposal of integrating ADA into Bitcoin’s DeFi ecosystem could drastically reshape Cardano’s trajectory. Bitcoin currently lacks the DeFi infrastructure that platforms like Cardano or Ethereum possess. If ADA becomes the bridge between Bitcoin and decentralized finance, it could benefit from greater adoption, transaction volume, and long-term demand. However, success will depend on cross-chain infrastructure, developer support, and regulatory clarity. If executed well, this move could solidify ADA’s place as a high-yield, utility-rich asset, potentially outperforming Bitcoin in functionality and returns.

The Central Bank of Bolivia signed memorandum with El Salvador’s Digital Assets Commission. Bolivia’s virtual asset usage surged from $46.5 million to $294 million annually. Both nations commit to sharing technical knowledge and regulatory experiences. Bolivia shows strong crypto growth The use of cryptocurrency in Bolivia rose from $46.5 million to $294 million in the span of one year. The rise took place after the implementation of R.D. No. 082/2024 regulatory framework. High adoption is recorded in the June 2024 to June 2025 period. The Central Bank of Bolivia executed an agreement with the National Commission of Digital Assets of El Salvador. They both wish to cooperate and share information. The agreement is regarding crypto assets and blockchain. Juan Carlos Reyes García from CNAD and Edwin Rojas Ulo from BCB signed the memorandum. The memorandum starts right away and has no expiration date. Bolivia benefits from El Salvador’s experience with regulations and use of virtual assets. The collaboration entails the exchange of technical and legal expertise between nations. Countries will exchange blockchain intelligence platforms and risk analysis methods. The system operates within the regulatory capacities and jurisdictions of each institution. This partnership is regarded by Bolivia as a significant move towards national development. The nation acquires El Salvador’s guidelines to prepare and means of implementing them. Collaboration will develop safe and controlled spaces that will draw investments. The agreement makes progress in digital assets a valid currency choice. Small businesses and households benefit most from such inclusion schemes. El Salvador’s regulatory leadership faces Bitcoin policy changes El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets became key player in global ecosystem. CNAD promotes innovation, security, and regulatory compliance across the digital asset sector. The commission regulates and supervises the industry including cryptoassets and tokens. El Salvador established itself as pioneer in virtual asset regulation regionally. The Central American nation ranks among most advanced countries promoting digital assets. However, El Salvador revoked Bitcoin’s legal tender status in January 2025. The policy change occurred through deal with International Monetary Fund. El Salvador agreed to halt new public-sector Bitcoin purchases for $1.4 billion loan. Current government Bitcoin holdings stand at approximately 6,253 BTC as of July. This number hasn’t changed since early 2025 due to IMF restrictions. Recent increases in reported reserves result from internal wallet consolidations only. The reserve figure shows existing holdings rather than fresh market purchases. El Salvador maintains Bitcoin position while complying with IMF loan conditions.

2025-07-31 08:30:44+00:00,"Ethereum Price Crash Or Rebound? Why $4,000 Holds The Key","Ethereum has struggled with the resistance at $4,000 over the last three years and has yet to make a definite break above this level. The constant rejection from here suggests that this is now the level to beat if the Ethereum price is to ever resume its campaign for new all-time highs from here. Given this, how the price reacts now to this level will determine whether there is a major crash coming or if bulls can continue their domination and trigger an altcoin season. $4,000 Is The Decision-Maker For Ethereum After multiple failed retests over the last year, the $4,000 has emerged as the undisputed psychological level for the Ethereum price. Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader refers to this as a high-timeframe barrier due to these rejections and the major level to watch to determine the next direction for ETH. Related Reading: This Indicator Has Perfectly Called Bitcoin Cycle Tops, Here’s What It’s Saying Now In the analysis, Alchemist explains that Ethereum has now entered a decisive stage while testing the upper boundary of a long-standing range. This long-standing range is identified as the $1,300-$4,000 range, which has held for more than a year. Following the most recent failure to break out of $4,000, Ethereum has fallen back into the range and has now entered consolidation. Below $4,000, the analyst believes that trading Ethereum is filled with both opportunity and risk. This all depends on whether the altcoin breaks out or fails next, putting investors in a precarious position of picking whether to long or short the digital asset at this level. Since previous retests of the $4,000 have led to rejections and a push back toward the mid-range or lower levels, it is possible that this time follows the established trend. However, there is still a lot of bullish sentiment in the market, and Ethereum could ride this wave into another breakout from here. What Happens In A Break Or Rejection In the event of a breakout above the $4,000, the crypto analyst does see the Ethereum price reaching new yearly highs from here. The first major resistance after $4,000 would be the $4,500 level. Next up would then be the $5,000 psychological level, which would mean brand new all-time highs for the altcoin if it were to test this resistance. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To $20,000? ETH Is Mirroring Bitcoin’s Move From 2021 On the flip side, another total rejection of $4,000 could trigger a massive crash. The last rejection from this psychological resistance back in December 2024 led to a multi-month decline that saw the price crash more than 60% before finding a bottom four months later at around $1,500. In the latter scenario, the analyst expects the Ethereum price to continue to trade inside the established $1,300-$4,000 range. As such, Alchemist advises investors that “Until a decisive move occurs, traders should remain cautious and reactive rather than overly anticipatory.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",newsbtc,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-price-crash-4000/,ETH|TRADING|ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS,Ethereum|crypto|crypto news|ETH|ETH news|eth price|ethereum|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT,BTC,"Ethereum Price Crash Or Rebound? Why $4,000 Holds The Key. Ethereum has struggled with the resistance at $4,000 over the last three years and has yet to make a definite break above this level. The constant rejection from here suggests that this is now the level to beat if the Ethereum price is to ever resume its campaign for new all-time highs from here. Given this, how the price reacts now to this level will determine whether there is a major crash coming or if bulls can continue their domination and trigger an altcoin season. $4,000 Is The Decision-Maker For Ethereum After multiple failed retests over the last year, the $4,000 has emerged as the undisputed psychological level for the Ethereum price. Crypto analyst The Alchemist Trader refers to this as a high-timeframe barrier due to these rejections and the major level to watch to determine the next direction for ETH. Related Reading: This Indicator Has Perfectly Called Bitcoin Cycle Tops, Here’s What It’s Saying Now In the analysis, Alchemist explains that Ethereum has now entered a decisive stage while testing the upper boundary of a long-standing range. This long-standing range is identified as the $1,300-$4,000 range, which has held for more than a year.

2025-07-31 08:40:11+00:00,MicroStrategy’s Alarming Stock Slide: Why Put Options Are Surging,"BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy’s Alarming Stock Slide: Why Put Options Are Surging In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency and traditional finance, certain events send ripples across both markets. Recently, one such event has captivated attention: the significant slide in MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock, a company synonymous with corporate Bitcoin holdings. This downturn has triggered an intriguing surge in demand for put options, signaling a growing wave of bearish sentiment among investors. What exactly is driving this trend, and what does it mean for the broader market? What’s Driving the Surge in MicroStrategy Put Options? MicroStrategy , once known primarily for its business intelligence software, has become the largest publicly traded holder of Bitcoin, effectively transforming its stock into a proxy for the leading cryptocurrency. This unique position means its stock price often mirrors Bitcoin’s volatility, amplifying both its upsides and its downsides. Recent weeks have seen MSTR’s stock price tumble by over 14%, reaching approximately $292. This sharp decline has not gone unnoticed by the options market. Data reported by CoinDesk indicates a dramatic increase in the demand for put options on MicroStrategy stock. Put options are financial contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell an asset at a specified price (the strike price) on or before a certain date. They are typically bought by investors who anticipate a price decline and wish to profit from it or hedge against potential losses. The intensity of this bearish sentiment is further highlighted by the one-year put-call skew, which soared to 3.6%. This figure represents its highest point since April 17, indicating a significant preference for puts over calls. A rising put-call skew suggests that investors are willing to pay a premium for downside protection, reflecting deep concerns about the stock’s future performance. Understanding Put Options and Bearish Sentiment for MicroStrategy To truly grasp the implications of the current situation, it’s essential to understand the mechanics of put options and what a high put-call skew signifies: Put Options Explained: Imagine you own a stock, and you’re worried its price might drop. You can buy a put option, which acts like an insurance policy. If the stock price falls below your chosen strike price, you can ‘put’ (sell) your shares at that higher, agreed-upon price, limiting your losses. Speculators also buy puts if they simply believe a stock will fall, hoping to profit from the decline. Call Options Explained: Conversely, call options give the holder the right to buy an asset at a specified price. They are typically bought by investors who anticipate a price increase. The Put-Call Skew: This metric compares the implied volatility of out-of-the-money put options to out-of-the-money call options. When the skew is positive and rising, it means that the demand for puts (downside protection) is significantly higher than the demand for calls (upside potential). For MicroStrategy , a 3.6% skew signals strong bearish conviction. The recent surge in put option demand for MicroStrategy suggests that a substantial number of market participants believe the stock has more room to fall, or they are actively seeking to protect their existing positions against further declines. This is a clear indicator of growing apprehension surrounding the company’s valuation and its exposure to Bitcoin’s inherent volatility. The Bitcoin Connection: How MicroStrategy ‘s Holdings Influence Its Stock The fortunes of MicroStrategy are inextricably linked to Bitcoin. Under the leadership of its co-founder Michael Saylor, the company embarked on an aggressive strategy of accumulating Bitcoin, turning its corporate treasury into a massive digital asset reserve. This strategy has yielded significant returns during Bitcoin bull runs but also exposes the company to substantial risk during market downturns. Here’s how this connection plays out: Bitcoin Proxy: For many investors, buying MSTR stock is a way to gain indirect exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This makes MSTR highly sensitive to Bitcoin price movements. Balance Sheet Impact: Bitcoin holdings dominate MicroStrategy ‘s balance sheet. Any significant decline in Bitcoin’s value directly impacts the company’s reported assets, which can in turn affect investor confidence and stock valuation. Market Sentiment: Broader market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, directly influences how investors perceive MSTR. Negative news or a bearish trend in the crypto market can quickly translate into selling pressure for MicroStrategy stock. While MicroStrategy ’s conviction in Bitcoin remains strong, the recent stock slide and the rush for put options highlight the market’s concern over the concentrated risk.

2025-07-31 08:50:11+00:00,US Dollar Strength Unleashes Crucial Shifts in Forex Market,"BitcoinWorld US Dollar Strength Unleashes Crucial Shifts in Forex Market The US Dollar’s recent resurgence, marking its first monthly gain this year, has sent palpable ripples across global financial markets. For anyone navigating the complex world of cryptocurrencies, this isn’t just a distant currency headline; it’s a crucial signal. A stronger US Dollar strength often correlates with a tougher environment for risk assets like Bitcoin and altcoins, making understanding its underlying drivers paramount. Let’s delve into what’s propelling the greenback forward and what it means for your portfolio. Understanding the Recent US Dollar Strength : What’s Driving It? The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar against a basket of six major currencies, has demonstrated remarkable resilience. After a period of weakness, its recent climb signifies a significant shift in market sentiment. But what exactly is fueling this newfound vigor? Interest Rate Differentials: The Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance on monetary policy, coupled with expectations of further rate hikes, makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to investors seeking higher yields compared to other major economies. Safe-Haven Appeal: In times of global economic uncertainty or geopolitical tensions, the US Dollar traditionally serves as a safe-haven asset. Investors flock to its perceived stability, pushing its value higher. Economic Resilience: Despite ongoing inflation concerns, the US economy has shown signs of robustness, particularly in the labor market. This relative strength compared to some other developed nations attracts capital inflows. Liquidity: The dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve currency ensures deep liquidity, making it easy for large institutions to move capital in and out, further supporting its demand. Imagine a scenario where global growth concerns are rising, and other major economies face headwinds. In such an environment, the dollar becomes a beacon for capital, drawing funds from less stable regions and boosting its valuation. Jerome Powell Hawkish Tone: A Deep Dive into Fed’s Stance A primary catalyst for the dollar’s recent rally has been the unwavering, indeed, Jerome Powell hawkish rhetoric. The Federal Reserve Chair has consistently emphasized the central bank’s commitment to taming inflation, even if it means prolonged periods of restrictive monetary policy. His recent comments have left little doubt about the Fed’s resolve. Key takeaways from Powell’s recent statements include: Inflation Fight Remains Priority: Powell reiterated that inflation remains too high and the Fed is far from declaring victory. He signaled a willingness to keep rates elevated for an extended period to ensure inflation returns to the 2% target. ‘Higher for Longer’ Narrative: This phrase has become synonymous with the Fed’s current approach. It suggests that even if rate hikes pause, a quick pivot to rate cuts is unlikely. This prolonged period of high rates supports the dollar. Data-Dependent Decisions: While committed to fighting inflation, Powell stressed that future policy decisions would be data-dependent, implying flexibility but leaning towards continued vigilance. Risks of Easing Prematurely: The Fed Chair has warned against the dangers of easing policy too soon, which could lead to a resurgence of inflationary pressures, necessitating even more aggressive action later. This steadfast commitment to tightening, even as some other central banks show signs of wavering, creates a significant divergence in monetary policy, making the dollar more appealing to global investors. The Ripple Effect: How Interest Rate Hike Expectations Impact Markets The anticipation of continued interest rate hike s by the Federal Reserve sends powerful signals across all asset classes. Higher interest rates in the US have a multifaceted impact: Impact on Currencies: When the Fed raises rates, it increases the yield on dollar-denominated assets like Treasury bonds. This makes the dollar more attractive to foreign investors, increasing demand for the currency and pushing its value up relative to others. This dynamic is clearly visible in pairs like EUR/USD and JPY/USD, where the dollar has gained ground. Impact on Equities: Higher interest rates generally lead to higher borrowing costs for companies, which can squeeze profit margins. This can make equity investments less attractive, especially for growth stocks that rely on future earnings. Furthermore, a stronger dollar can negatively impact the earnings of US multinational corporations that derive a significant portion of their revenue from overseas. Impact on Commodities: Commodities, often priced in US Dollars (e.g., oil, gold), tend to become more expensive for holders of other currencies when the dollar strengthens. This can dampen demand and put downward pressure on commodity prices. Gold, traditionally seen as an inflation hedge, often struggles in a strong dollar, high-interest-rat",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/us-dollar-forex-market-shifts/,FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|BTC,Forex News|Economy|Forex|interest rates|Jerome Powell|US Dollar,BTC,"US Dollar Strength Unleashes Crucial Shifts in Forex Market.

BPENGU is stealing the spotlight,"Bitcoin may have stumbled below $116,000 after Powell’s hawkish tone on rates and inflation, but it didn’t take long for bulls to step back in. The world’s biggest cryptocurrency is now trading near $118,000—just shy of its all-time high—and investors are once again turning to new altcoins in search of explosive upside. And right now, no project has more buzz—or a more promising setup—than Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU). The next Pudgy? Bitcoin Penguins brings the heat If you missed out on Pudgy Penguins, Bitcoin Penguins is the project to watch. Drawing clear inspiration from Pudgy’s viral success and merging it with Bitcoin’s brand power, BPENGU is positioning itself as the breakout meme coin of the season. But here’s what makes it different: while Pudgy Penguins took off as a collectable, BPENGU is designed to reward its holders with serious upside. The presale is structured with fixed-stage pricing, rising by 5% at each step. That means early buyers are already sitting on strong paper gains, and those gains will only grow until the August 27 close. Another key factor driving interest is investor behaviour. Crypto traders are constantly seeking the next breakout project, and many who profited from Pudgy Penguins are now scanning the horizon for the next opportunity. Bitcoin Penguins, with its familiar branding and Bitcoin-native architecture, is well-positioned to capture that attention. Even better? The tokenomics are aggressively retail-friendly: only 3% of supply goes to insiders, with the vast majority committed to community, staking, and liquidity. This isn’t just another hype cycle—it’s a carefully designed, high-potential launch with real traction. Why Bitcoin’s price pullback doesn’t matter The Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady spooked markets briefly, but crypto has already shaken it off. Powell’s warnings on tariffs and inflation led to a momentary drop in Bitcoin prices, but the quick recovery to $118,000 shows that risk appetite is alive and well. And as rates stay high, more investors are shifting from top-heavy Bitcoin bets into emerging, low-cap plays. Presales are back in favour, and BPENGU is leading that charge. Beyond the presale mechanics, BPENGU is packing serious utility: up to 100% APY staking rewards, a weekly 1 BTC jackpot, and a rapidly expanding community. With a token listing slated for September 2, the runway is short, the price is still low, and the upside is massive. In a market that’s hungry for the next big narrative, Bitcoin Penguins is checking every box.

The move was disclosed in a recent S-3 registration statement filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). BTCS To Accumulate More Ethereum? According to a recent S-3 filing with the US financial watchdog, US-based digital assets firm BTCS is eyeing a raise of $2 billion through share sales in a bid to grow its digital assets portfolio and expand operations. Specifically, BTCS aims to sell common shares across multiple offerings, subject to a total offering cap of $2 billion. In the official SEC filing, the company remarked: We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities by us to provide additional funds for purchasing digital assets, working capital, and other general corporate purposes. In addition to the S-3 filing, BTCS submitted a separate filing for the resale of more than five million shares of common stock related to prior convertible notes and warrants. The firm expects to generate up to $12 million from this offering. BTCS has been steadily increasing its ETH reserves throughout 2025. Most recently, it purchased 14,420 ETH, bringing its total holdings to 70,028 ETH – currently valued at around $275 million. According to data from CoinGecko, BTCS ranks fifth among publicly-traded companies with the largest ETH treasuries. BitMine Immersion Technologies tops the list, holding 566,776 ETH on its balance sheet. At the time of writing, BTCS shares recorded a slight pullback, trading 2.6% lower at $4.91. However, the Nasdaq-listed firm is still up almost 100% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis. ETH Accumulation In Full Force While previous years saw corporate giants like Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Tesla, and Coinbase amassing Bitcoin (BTC) reserves, 2025 is shaping up to be the year of Ethereum accumulation. Another Nasdaq-listed firm – SharpLink Gaming – recently acquired 79,949 ETH, expanding its total digital assets reserves to 360,807 ETH. This came after the firm had disclosed plans to spend as much as $5 billion to buy more ETH. Similarly, Bit Digital bought 19,683 ETH last week, using net proceeds from its recently concluded $67.3 million share offering. Another publicly-traded company, GameSquare invested $5 million in ETH as part of corporate treasury strategy. Meanwhile, inflows attracted by spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) continue to increase, recently eclipsing even those recorded by their BTC counterparts.

2025-07-31 09:10:11+00:00,Phoenix Group Unveils Impressive Bitcoin Holdings Growth in Q2,"BitcoinWorld Phoenix Group Unveils Impressive Bitcoin Holdings Growth in Q2 In the dynamic world of digital assets, institutional adoption continues to be a pivotal driver, signaling a maturing market. Dubai-based Phoenix Group, a prominent name in crypto mining equipment distribution, recently made headlines with a significant expansion of its Bitcoin holdings in the second quarter. This strategic move not only solidified their position as a major player but also highlighted a growing trend among corporations to formalize substantial digital asset treasury strategies. What does this mean for the crypto landscape, and why are companies like Phoenix Group increasingly betting big on assets like Bitcoin and Solana? Phoenix Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Holdings Expansion – A Powerful Statement Phoenix Group’s latest announcement isn’t just a mere statistic; it’s a powerful testament to a meticulously crafted financial strategy. According to a Business Wire press release, the company formalized a staggering $150 million digital asset treasury strategy, signaling a profound, long-term commitment to the crypto space. In Q2 alone, they acquired an impressive 179 Bitcoin, propelling their total Bitcoin holdings to a remarkable 514 BTC. This substantial acquisition places them among a growing cohort of public and private companies embracing digital assets as a core component of their balance sheets. Crucially, their digital asset portfolio extends beyond just Bitcoin; they also hold over 630,000 SOL, showcasing a diversified and forward-thinking approach to their digital treasury. The formalization of this $150 million strategy moves beyond speculative trading. It indicates a structured, long-term investment philosophy, integrating digital assets into their core financial operations. For a company primarily known as a leading distributor of crypto mining equipment, this strategic pivot into direct asset ownership creates a synergistic ecosystem. It allows them to not only facilitate mining operations globally but also directly participate in the appreciation of the very assets their equipment helps to secure. This dual approach could provide a robust hedge against market fluctuations, ensuring profitability across different facets of the crypto economy and sending a strong signal to the market about the company’s confidence in the enduring value and future growth of digital currencies. Why are Bitcoin Holdings Becoming a Corporate Imperative? The decision by companies like Phoenix Group to accumulate significant Bitcoin holdings isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a broader, evolving corporate treasury management landscape. For years, traditional corporate treasuries focused primarily on cash, bonds, and other low-yield, stable assets. However, with persistent inflation concerns, negative real interest rates in many traditional markets, and a global search for alternative stores of value, Bitcoin has emerged as a compelling option. What precisely drives this profound shift in corporate financial strategy? Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s strictly limited supply of 21 million coins positions it as a robust hedge against the inflationary pressures eroding fiat currency purchasing power. Companies view it as ‘digital gold,’ a scarce asset designed to retain value over time. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its inherent volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated unparalleled long-term growth potential. Corporations are increasingly willing to accept short-term price swings for the prospect of significant capital appreciation. Diversification Benefits: Adding cryptocurrencies to a traditional portfolio can offer diversification benefits. Bitcoin’s often low correlation with traditional asset classes can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns, especially during economic uncertainty. Technological Alignment: Investing in Bitcoin and other digital assets aligns companies with cutting-edge technology and the burgeoning digital economy. It signals innovation and adaptability to stakeholders. First-Mover Advantage: While institutional adoption is accelerating, early movers can establish themselves as leaders in the evolving digital financial landscape. Liquidity and Accessibility: Bitcoin is highly liquid, with a global 24/7 market, making it easy to buy and sell. Maturing infrastructure for institutional access, including secure custody solutions, has reduced operational hurdles. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, demonstrating a successful model for integrating digital assets into corporate finance. Tesla also made headlines with its significant BTC purchases, further legitimizing the asset class in corporate boardrooms.

2025-07-31 09:15:10+00:00,Bitcoin’s Unstoppable Reign: Why Pompliano Crowns It ‘King of Wall Street’,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Unstoppable Reign: Why Pompliano Crowns It ‘King of Wall Street’ In the dynamic world of finance, few assets command attention quite like Bitcoin . What was once considered a niche digital curiosity has undeniably ascended to the forefront of investment conversations, captivating both individual enthusiasts and institutional giants alike. Recently, a powerful declaration from a prominent voice in the crypto space has echoed across financial markets, solidifying Bitcoin’s burgeoning status. Anthony Pompliano, the insightful founder and CEO of ProCapBTC, didn’t mince words during a recent CNBC interview, boldly proclaiming that Bitcoin has transitioned from a fringe investment into a widely embraced asset, unequivocally calling it “the king of Wall Street.” This isn’t just hyperbole; it’s a reflection of a profound shift in how the financial world perceives and integrates the leading cryptocurrency. The Coronation: Why Bitcoin is ‘King of Wall Street’ Pompliano’s pronouncement isn’t made in a vacuum. It stems from a meticulous observation of market trends and economic shifts that highlight Bitcoin’s superior performance and increasing relevance. His argument is multi-faceted, drawing on critical comparisons with traditional financial benchmarks. The essence of his claim lies in Bitcoin’s remarkable resilience and appreciation, especially when contrasted with the weakening purchasing power of fiat currencies and the underperformance of conventional equities. Erosion of Fiat Purchasing Power: One of Pompliano’s key points, as highlighted by Wu Blockchain, is the significant decline in the U.S. dollar’s purchasing power. Over the past five years, the dollar has reportedly seen a roughly 30% reduction in its value. This erosion means that holding traditional cash assets has resulted in a substantial loss of wealth over time, making a compelling case for alternative stores of value. S&P 500’s Underperformance Against Bitcoin: Perhaps even more striking is the comparison between the S&P 500, a cornerstone of traditional investment, and Bitcoin. Since 2020, the S&P 500 has plummeted by more than 85% when its performance is measured in Bitcoin. This stark contrast underscores Bitcoin’s exponential growth and its potential as a superior long-term investment, outshining even the most robust stock market indices. Institutional Embrace: The ‘king’ status isn’t just about performance; it’s about acceptance. Wall Street, once skeptical, is now actively integrating Bitcoin. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has opened floodgates for institutional capital, providing regulated and accessible avenues for major players to gain exposure to the digital asset. Decoding the Institutional Embrace: Who’s Adopting Bitcoin and Why? The journey of Bitcoin from a fringe asset to a Wall Street darling is largely attributed to the growing institutional embrace. This isn’t a sudden phenomenon but a gradual recognition of Bitcoin’s unique attributes and its role in a diversified portfolio. But who exactly is adopting Bitcoin, and what are their motivations? Major Players Entering the Bitcoin Arena: The list of institutions exploring or directly investing in Bitcoin is growing. This includes: Asset Managers: Firms like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have launched Bitcoin ETFs, allowing their vast client bases to invest in Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Publicly Traded Corporations: Companies like MicroStrategy have made significant Bitcoin acquisitions, integrating it into their treasury reserves as a hedge against inflation and a growth asset. Hedge Funds and Family Offices: These sophisticated investors are allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, seeking diversification and asymmetric returns. Payment Processors: Companies like PayPal and Square (Block Inc.) have integrated Bitcoin into their services, making it more accessible for everyday transactions and investment. What are the Driving Forces Behind This Bitcoin Adoption? Several factors are propelling this institutional shift towards Bitcoin: Factor Explanation Inflation Hedge With unprecedented monetary easing and rising inflation concerns globally, institutions view Bitcoin’s finite supply (21 million coins) as a robust hedge against currency debasement, much like digital gold. Digital Gold Narrative Bitcoin shares characteristics with gold – scarcity, divisibility, and portability – but offers superior digital transferability and resistance to censorship.

The cooperation agreement enables mutual information exchange and knowledge sharing on blockchain intelligence tools, risk analysis, and regulatory experiences between both institutions. Source: Press Release Bolivia’s Virtual Asset Usage Explodes 532% in One Year Bolivia’s virtual asset usage surged from $46.5 million to $294 million between June 2024 and June 2025 following regulatory changes. Source: Reuters The partnership comes into effect immediately for an indefinite period. This positions Bolivia to benefit from El Salvador’s pioneering regulatory framework and practical experience as the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. El Salvador’s CNAD has become a fundamental actor in the global digital assets ecosystem. Bolivia’s embrace of cryptocurrency contrasts sharply with its historical stance, having previously maintained strict prohibitions on virtual assets before implementing Board Resolution 082/2024 in June 2024. The policy shift enables legal use of virtual assets for cross-border transactions and e-commerce payments. The agreement consolidates progress made in establishing digital assets as viable alternatives for families and small entrepreneurs. At the same time, Bolivia’s Central Bank commits to developing policies that modernize the financial system and deepen financial inclusion through regulated cryptocurrency ecosystems. El Salvador’s experience provides valuable guidance despite recent International Monetary Fund restrictions that have capped the country’s Bitcoin purchases and mandated privatization of the state-run Chivo wallet by July 2025. Bolivia’s Cryptocurrency Revolution Gains Momentum Earlier this year, the Central Bank of Bolivia authorized state oil company YPFB to use cryptocurrency for purchasing crude oil and diesel from international vendors in March 2025. They aimed to address foreign currency shortages that created fuel supply disruptions across the country. President Luis Arce’s cabinet granted YPFB permission to conduct fuel import deals using either USD or cryptocurrency, with Bolivia requiring at least $60 million weekly for fuel imports. The decree instructs YPFB to make budgetary adjustments covering financial costs within applicable regulations. Bolivia’s cryptocurrency adoption has accelerated rapidly, with virtual asset transactions exceeding 1.1 million from July to September 2024 , compared to 932,000 in the six months before then. Six financial institutions began operating with virtual assets, reporting 40% growth in operations between July and August. The Central Bank launched educational initiatives, conducting over 33 workshops nationwide, reaching more than 3,000 participants to inform the public about virtual asset characteristics and risks. The legal framework enables Bolivians to use cryptocurrency for cross-border transactions and e-commerce payments. The partnership with El Salvador provides technical expertise for developing secure and regulated cryptocurrency ecosystems. Source: Press Release Bolivia joins a growing number of countries using cryptocurrency for international trade, particularly those seeking alternatives to traditional banking systems amid sanctions or political tensions. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Model Faces IMF Constraints El Salvador maintains approximately 6,244 Bitcoin worth $742 million despite IMF loan agreement restrictions preventing new government purchases since February 2025. The $1.4 billion loan program requires the country to maintain unchanged Bitcoin holdings and privatize the Chivo wallet. President Nayib Bukele’s previous claims of daily Bitcoin purchases have been contradicted by IMF documentation confirming no new acquisitions since the loan agreement. On-chain activity showing Bitcoin movements between wallets represents internal transfers rather than fresh purchases. The IMF praised El Salvador’s updated Bitcoin policy for reducing fiscal risk and strengthening transparency, noting these steps help stabilize inflation and restore macroeconomic stability. However, Bitcoin is no longer considered mandatory legal tender under the agreement. El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment appears to be faltering under the weight of an IMF loan agreement and declining public engagement. #IMF #ElSalvador https://t.co/65lADRixOH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 26, 2025 El Salvador’s CNAD has consolidated its position as a regional leader in cryptocurrency regulation, promoting innovation, security, and regulatory compliance throughout the digital assets sector.

BTC Recovers After FOMC Meeting After the correction at the end of the previous business week, which drove BTC to a 14-day low of under $114,500, the primary cryptocurrency managed to recover most losses and even headed toward $120,000 at the beginning of the current one.

All eyes turned to the US central bank, especially after the country’s GDP report for Q2 was significantly higher than expected. However, the Fed refused to change the interest rates, which resulted in some volatility for BTC.

2025-07-31 09:30:11+00:00,Bitcoin Investment: ANAP Holdings’ Bold Move into Crypto,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investment: ANAP Holdings’ Bold Move into Crypto Imagine your favorite fashion brand making significant moves in the digital asset space. This isn’t a futuristic fantasy; it’s today’s reality. Japanese fashion powerhouse ANAP Holdings has once again turned heads in the financial world with its latest Bitcoin investment , signaling growing confidence among traditional businesses in the decentralized future. ANAP Holdings’ Strategic Bitcoin Investment: A Fashion Statement? Japanese fashion brand ANAP Holdings recently announced another substantial acquisition of Bitcoin, adding 16.9786 BTC to its reserves. This elevates ANAP’s total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 831.1191 BTC. For a company known for trendy apparel, this consistent accumulation speaks volumes about its long-term vision and belief in digital assets. This isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the Bitcoin market. The company has steadily built its crypto treasury, with a clear ambition to acquire over 1,000 BTC by August. This aggressive target highlights a profound commitment to Bitcoin as a core component of their financial strategy, moving beyond traditional fiat assets. What compels a fashion brand to make such a significant Bitcoin investment ? It’s a tangible example of how companies view Bitcoin not merely as speculative, but as a legitimate store of value and a strategic hedge against economic uncertainties. Why Are Companies Like ANAP Making a Bitcoin Investment? Traditional corporate treasury strategies are evolving. Factors like inflation, negative real interest rates, and geopolitical instability push companies to explore alternatives. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature, finite supply, and growing institutional acceptance, offers a compelling option. Key reasons for a substantial Bitcoin investment : Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s capped supply (21 million coins) makes it an attractive hedge against inflation and currency debasement, preserving purchasing power. Potential for Appreciation: Despite volatility, Bitcoin shows significant long-term growth. Companies aim for substantial returns on idle cash. Diversification: Bitcoin diversifies a treasury portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk by adding an uncorrelated asset class. Technological Alignment: Investing in Bitcoin signals innovation, enhancing brand image and appealing to tech-savvy consumers. Navigating the Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: What Are the Risks? While benefits are compelling, corporate Bitcoin investment has challenges. Companies must carefully weigh these factors: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s swings offer opportunities but also risks of substantial losses, impacting financial statements. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving regulations across jurisdictions can affect legality, tax treatment, or operations. Security Concerns: Storing large amounts of Bitcoin requires robust security to prevent hacks or loss of keys. Accounting Complexities: Bitcoin’s intangible asset classification can lead to non-cash impairment charges if prices drop. ANAP’s steady increase suggests they manage these risks, viewing them as acceptable trade-offs for long-term benefits. Pioneers of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: Who Else is Leading the Charge? ANAP Holdings joins a growing cohort of public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, famously spearheaded this trend, adopting Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset. Other notable examples include: Tesla: The EV giant made a significant Bitcoin investment in early 2021, legitimizing Bitcoin for many mainstream investors. Block (formerly Square): Jack Dorsey’s payments company not only holds Bitcoin but integrates it into Cash App, allowing users to buy, sell, and store it. These pioneers demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits for companies of various sizes and industries to incorporate Bitcoin. ANAP’s entry from the fashion sector broadens this corporate trend’s appeal. The Future of Corporate Bitcoin Investment: What Does ANAP’s Move Signify? ANAP’s ambitious Bitcoin investment strategy is a powerful signal. It suggests corporate adoption of digital assets is a fundamental shift in how businesses manage financial resources. As more companies see benefits and ecosystem maturity, a snowball effect is possible. This trend could lead to: Increased Mainstream Acceptance: Companies embracing Bitcoin normalize its status, reducing skepticism. New Financial Products: Corporate demand will spur innovation in traditional finance. Greater Regulatory Clarity: Growing corporate adoption compels clearer government guidelines. ANAP’s commitment to 1,000 BTC by August is a bold statement. It shows conviction that Bitcoin is a viable, strategic asset for established businesses to future-proof their balance sheets in an unpredictable global economy.

2025-07-31 09:35:10+00:00,Explosive Altcoin Market: Futures Trading Volume Surges to Five-Month High,"BitcoinWorld Explosive Altcoin Market: Futures Trading Volume Surges to Five-Month High Are you feeling the buzz in the cryptocurrency world? If so, you’re not alone. The digital asset space is currently witnessing a phenomenal shift, with the altcoin market taking center stage. Following Bitcoin’s impressive rally to around $120,000, it appears that the spotlight has firmly turned towards alternative cryptocurrencies, often referred to as altcoins. This isn’t just a ripple; it’s a wave, with on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant reporting a significant surge in trading activity, particularly within the perpetual futures segment. What’s Fueling the Altcoin Market Frenzy? The latest data from CryptoQuant, shared on X, paints a compelling picture: altcoins are gaining substantial momentum. This isn’t just anecdotal observation; the numbers speak volumes. Trading activity in the altcoin market , especially in perpetual futures contracts, has seen a remarkable uptick. But what exactly does this surge entail, and why is it so significant? The combined trading volume for Ethereum (ETH) and other altcoin perpetual contracts has soared to an astonishing $223.6 billion. To put this into perspective, this figure represents the highest volume recorded in five months. Even more striking is that this massive volume now constitutes 83% of the total trading volume across centralized exchanges. This dominance clearly indicates a shift in trader focus and capital allocation. Bitcoin’s Precedent: Bitcoin’s strong performance often acts as a catalyst, pulling the broader crypto market, including altcoins, upwards. Its recent surge has instilled confidence, prompting traders to explore higher-beta assets. Search for Alpha: After Bitcoin’s initial run, many traders look to altcoins for potentially larger percentage gains, leveraging their inherent volatility. Narrative-Driven Cycles: Specific narratives within the altcoin space, such as Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Artificial Intelligence (AI), or Real World Assets (RWAs), can ignite significant interest and trading volume in related projects. Why Are Perpetual Futures So Important for the Altcoin Market? Perpetual futures are a type of derivative contract that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous speculation. Their surge in the altcoin market signifies several key trends: Increased Speculation: A high volume in perpetual futures indicates aggressive speculative activity. Traders are actively taking leveraged positions, betting on significant price movements in altcoins. Enhanced Liquidity: The influx of trading volume provides deeper liquidity to the altcoin futures market, making it easier for large orders to be executed without significant price slippage. Broader Participation: The accessibility of perpetual futures on centralized exchanges attracts a wide range of participants, from retail traders to institutional players, all seeking to capitalize on altcoin volatility. Market Sentiment Indicator: High open interest and trading volume in perpetual futures can be a strong indicator of bullish sentiment, as traders are willing to take on more risk for potential gains. Conversely, a sudden drop could signal a shift in sentiment. Is This Sustainable? Understanding the Benefits and Challenges of the Altcoin Market Boom The current momentum in the altcoin market presents both exciting opportunities and inherent risks. Understanding these aspects is crucial for anyone looking to navigate this dynamic environment. Benefits: High Growth Potential: Altcoins, especially smaller cap projects, can offer exponential returns compared to more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Diversification: Investing in a diversified portfolio of altcoins can help spread risk and capture growth from various sectors within the crypto ecosystem. Innovation Exposure: Altcoins represent the cutting edge of blockchain technology, offering exposure to new applications, protocols, and use cases that could revolutionize various industries. Challenges: Extreme Volatility: While offering high returns, altcoins are notoriously volatile. Prices can swing wildly, leading to significant gains or losses in short periods. Liquidation Risk (in Futures): Trading perpetual futures involves leverage, which amplifies both gains and losses. Incorrect predictions can lead to rapid liquidations, wiping out an entire position. Rug Pulls and Scams: The altcoin space, particularly newer or lesser-known projects, is susceptible to scams and ‘rug pulls,’ where developers abandon a project and disappear with investor funds.

2025-07-31 09:40:10+00:00,Crucial Update: Binance RUNE Suspension for Essential THORChain Network Upgrade,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Update: Binance RUNE Suspension for Essential THORChain Network Upgrade In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying informed about exchange announcements is crucial for every investor and trader. A significant development has just emerged concerning THORChain (RUNE) holders on Binance. The global crypto exchange giant, Binance, has announced a temporary Binance RUNE suspension of deposits and withdrawals for the THORChain network. This move, scheduled for July 31st, 2024, at 17:00 UTC, is in direct support of an upcoming, vital upgrade to the THORChain network. Understanding the implications of this suspension and what steps to take is paramount for ensuring your assets remain secure and accessible. Understanding the Binance RUNE Suspension : What’s Happening? Binance, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, recently issued an official notice detailing its plans to halt all RUNE transactions on its platform. This isn’t an arbitrary decision but a standard procedure undertaken by exchanges to ensure the smooth and secure transition during significant blockchain network upgrades. The temporary Binance RUNE suspension specifically targets deposits and withdrawals of the THORChain network’s native token, RUNE. The announcement specifies that the suspension will commence precisely on July 31, 2024, at 17:00 UTC . While the exact duration of the suspension has not been explicitly stated beyond the commencement time, such halts typically last until the network upgrade is successfully completed and the network’s stability is verified. Users are advised to closely monitor Binance’s official announcements for updates regarding the resumption of services. Why do exchanges implement such measures? There are several key reasons: Data Integrity: To prevent any potential loss or corruption of user funds during the upgrade process, which often involves significant changes to the blockchain’s underlying architecture. Smooth Transition: To ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded on the new, upgraded chain, avoiding discrepancies or forks that could lead to confusion or financial losses. Security: Upgrades can sometimes expose temporary vulnerabilities. Suspending services minimizes the risk of exploitation during these critical periods. Compliance: Ensuring the exchange’s systems are fully compatible with the upgraded network’s protocols. This proactive step by Binance underscores its commitment to user security and the overall health of the THORChain ecosystem. It’s a testament to responsible exchange management, prioritizing the long-term stability of the assets it supports. What is THORChain (RUNE) and Why is This Upgrade Important? For those new to the space, THORChain (RUNE) stands as a groundbreaking decentralized liquidity protocol that enables seamless, non-custodial cross-chain swaps. Unlike traditional centralized exchanges, THORChain allows users to exchange native cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, and RUNE itself) directly between different blockchains without wrapping or bridging assets. This functionality is powered by its native utility token, RUNE, which is used for security, governance, and as a settlement asset within the network. Network upgrades are the lifeblood of any evolving blockchain project. They are essential for introducing new features, improving scalability, enhancing security, and fixing bugs. For THORChain, an upgrade can mean: Increased Efficiency: Faster transaction processing times and lower fees. Enhanced Security: Strengthening the network’s resilience against potential attacks. New Capabilities: Introduction of innovative functionalities that expand THORChain’s utility and appeal. Scalability Improvements: Preparing the network to handle a larger volume of transactions and users. While specific details of this particular THORChain upgrade have not been fully disclosed by Binance in their suspension notice, the very act of an exchange halting services for it signifies its importance. Such upgrades are critical for the long-term viability and competitiveness of decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like THORChain. For RUNE holders, a successful upgrade typically translates to a more robust, secure, and valuable network, potentially leading to increased adoption and utility for their assets. Actionable Insights for RUNE Holders: What Should You Do Amidst the Binance RUNE Suspension ? If you hold RUNE on Binance or plan to interact with the THORChain network, this announcement requires your immediate attention. Here are some actionable steps and considerations: Avoid Transactions: Absolutely refrain from initiating any RUNE deposits or withdrawals on Binance from July 31, 2024, 17:00 UTC, until Binance officially announces the resumption of these services.

The asset is currently moving toward the upper bands of its two-week range-bound channel and could break out soon. “I think I’m wrong about ETH getting some short-term downside,” crypto analyst ‘Byzantine General’ told his 236,000 X followers on Wednesday. “It’s too strong and refuses to print any significant correction,” they added, noting that derivatives funding rates were going negative. Funding rates are periodic payments between traders in perpetual futures contracts to keep the contract price aligned with the underlying asset’s spot price. When funding rates go below baseline, it usually indicates bearish market sentiment as more traders are short than long, creating an imbalance, but this doesn’t seem to be happening with ETH.

2025-07-31 10:00:23+00:00,Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the Hidden Winner At $0.035 While Bitcoin (BTC) Flatlines Near $119K for a Third Straight Day?,"While Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck in a consolidation phase near the $119,000 mark for several consecutive days, the spotlight is quietly shifting to an under-the-radar DeFi contender—Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Priced at just $0.035 in its ongoing Phase 6 presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong momentum among investors who are now actively looking beyond traditional blue-chip cryptocurrencies. What makes this protocol stand out isn’t price alone—it’s the well-structured, utility-driven ecosystem that backs the MUTM token with real DeFi mechanics and tangible value generation. Bitcoin (BTC) Flatlines for a Third Straight Day Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stagnant near $119,000 for three consecutive days, trading at ~$118,421 with a 0.39% 24-hour decline, as per CoinMarketCap data. Despite record ETF inflows exceeding $55 billion, including $157.02 million recently, BTC struggles to break the $120,000 resistance, with support at $116,000. On-chain data shows 40,000 BTC ($4.7B) flowed to exchanges recently, signaling profit-taking, while miners’ revenue pressures (MPI at 2.78) add headwinds. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart suggests a potential breakout, but low 7-day volatility (1.34%) indicates indecision. Institutional demand, driven by BlackRock’s IBIT ($20B+), remains robust, yet macro uncertainty from U.S.-China trade talks and a neutral Altcoin Season Index (51) dampen momentum. A break above $119,500 could target $122,000, but failure may see a dip to $112,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Building During Bitcoin’s Pause Bitcoin’s stability in the short term might signal uncertainty, but while large-cap assets consolidate, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are building from the ground up. The platform is not just a simple lending protocol—it represents a shift toward decentralized finance infrastructure that combines borrowing, lending, passive earnings, and native stablecoin integration within one framework. This makes it an ecosystem, not just a token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique Pooled-to-Contract (P2C) lending model enables users to deposit assets such as USDT, DAI, ETH, or BTC and receive mtTokens, which serve as interest-bearing tokens representing their share in the lending pool. These mtTokens automatically increase in value based on real-time pool utilization. Users can then stake these mtTokens in dedicated smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards—rewards that are consistently bought back from the open market using the platform’s revenue. This closed-loop reward system avoids inflation and aligns the interests of both protocol users and token holders. Meanwhile, the borrowing side offers overcollateralized loans using stable or blue-chip assets. For example, a borrower depositing $10,000 in ETH at a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio would receive $6,000 in liquidity—without having to sell their ETH. This model enables users to retain their asset exposure while accessing capital, a key incentive during sideways or bullish markets. Lenders, in turn, benefit from competitive APYs reaching 10–12%, especially during high utilization periods. For those seeking higher risk-reward strategies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduces Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This secondary model allows lenders to negotiate terms directly with borrowers—especially useful for newer or riskier memecoins like DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP. While it’s not the protocol’s core feature, it adds optionality for experienced users and demonstrates how the ecosystem is engineered for diverse DeFi participants. Security-conscious investors will also take note of the project’s CertiK audit, boasting a Token Security Score of 95 and Skynet rating of 78—demonstrating transparency and a commitment to protocol integrity. Moreover, the team is actively encouraging public participation with a $50,000 bug bounty program, while marketing efforts are being reinforced through a $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The Numbers That Matter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.035.

While Bitcoin (BTC) remains stuck in a consolidation phase near the $119,000 mark for several consecutive days, the spotlight is quietly shifting to an under-the-radar DeFi contender—Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Priced at just $0.035 in its ongoing Phase 6 presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining strong momentum among investors who are now actively looking beyond traditional blue-chip cryptocurrencies. What makes this protocol stand out isn’t price alone—it’s the well-structured, utility-driven ecosystem that backs the MUTM token with real DeFi mechanics and tangible value generation. Bitcoin (BTC) Flatlines for a Third Straight Day Bitcoin (BTC) has remained stagnant near $119,000 for three consecutive days, trading at ~$118,421 with a 0.39% 24-hour decline, as per CoinMarketCap data. Despite record ETF inflows exceeding $55 billion, including $157.02 million recently, BTC struggles to break the $120,000 resistance, with support at $116,000. On-chain data shows 40,000 BTC ($4.7B) flowed to exchanges recently, signaling profit-taking, while miners’ revenue pressures (MPI at 2.78) add headwinds. A symmetrical triangle pattern on the 4-hour chart suggests a potential breakout, but low 7-day volatility (1.34%) indicates indecision. Institutional demand, driven by BlackRock’s IBIT ($20B+), remains robust, yet macro uncertainty from U.S.-China trade talks and a neutral Altcoin Season Index (51) dampen momentum. A break above $119,500 could target $122,000, but failure may see a dip to $112,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Building During Bitcoin’s Pause Bitcoin’s stability in the short term might signal uncertainty, but while large-cap assets consolidate, projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are building from the ground up. The platform is not just a simple lending protocol—it represents a shift toward decentralized finance infrastructure that combines borrowing, lending, passive earnings, and native stablecoin integration within one framework. This makes it an ecosystem, not just a token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique Pooled-to-Contract (P2C) lending model enables users to deposit assets such as USDT, DAI, ETH, or BTC and receive mtTokens, which serve as interest-bearing tokens representing their share in the lending pool. These mtTokens automatically increase in value based on real-time pool utilization. Users can then stake these mtTokens in dedicated smart contracts to earn additional MUTM rewards—rewards that are consistently bought back from the open market using the platform’s revenue. This closed-loop reward system avoids inflation and aligns the interests of both protocol users and token holders. Meanwhile, the borrowing side offers overcollateralized loans using stable or blue-chip assets. For example, a borrower depositing $10,000 in ETH at a 60% Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio would receive $6,000 in liquidity—without having to sell their ETH. This model enables users to retain their asset exposure while accessing capital, a key incentive during sideways or bullish markets. Lenders, in turn, benefit from competitive APYs reaching 10–12%, especially during high utilization periods. For those seeking higher risk-reward strategies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduces Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. This secondary model allows lenders to negotiate terms directly with borrowers—especially useful for newer or riskier memecoins like DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP. While it’s not the protocol’s core feature, it adds optionality for experienced users and demonstrates how the ecosystem is engineered for diverse DeFi participants. Security-conscious investors will also take note of the project’s CertiK audit, boasting a Token Security Score of 95 and Skynet rating of 78—demonstrating transparency and a commitment to protocol integrity. Moreover, the team is actively encouraging public participation with a $50,000 bug bounty program, while marketing efforts are being reinforced through a $100,000 giveaway , where ten winners will receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The Numbers That Matter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, offering tokens at $0.035. So far, the project has already raised $13.8 million, with 14,700+ unique holders participating in the early rounds. As demand continues to build, the token price is set to increase by 15% to $0.040 in Phase 7. This rapid accumulation signals growing confidence in the platform, especially from users who are looking for strong upside potential rather than waiting for another BTC rally. The total token supply is 4 billion MUTM, and at a planned listing price of $0.06, those who got in at Phase 1 ($0.01) would be looking at 6x returns, while even current Phase 6 buyers at $0.035 could be eyeing a solid 70% upside before listing.

Dubbed a “regulatory Bible” by insiders, the report stems from President Trump’s Executive Order 14178 and aims to provide sweeping guidance on digital asset oversight, stablecoin rules, and national security concerns. Chaired by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with key contributions from SEC Chair Paul Atkins and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets has spent the last six months drafting what could become the foundation for U.S. crypto regulation for years to come. With growing political interest and pending crypto bills in Congress, this policy release is expected to influence not just lawmaking, but also market sentiment, especially around Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP. Strategic Bitcoin Reserves and Government Holdings A highly anticipated section of the report will focus on the U.S. government’s Bitcoin holdings, rumored to be around 198,000 BTC, worth over $23 billion. However, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) disclosures suggest that only 28,988 BTC may currently be under federal control. The report may also outline a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve strategy, first proposed by Trump in March, possibly indicating budget-neutral methods to accumulate more BTC. If confirmed, this move could influence global crypto adoption and attract more institutional investment. XRP Whales Bet Big Ahead of Policy Reveal Meanwhile, XRP whales have opened $25 million in long positions, anticipating favorable U.S. policy for domestically-rooted digital assets. Technical analysts cite a bullish pennant pattern with upside potential to $5.96 if current momentum holds. The convergence of regulatory clarity, potential reserve accumulation, and strategic legislation may push Bitcoin past $123,000 and ignite an XRP rally, marking the start of a new era in U.S. crypto policy and market behavior.

According to a recent report by CryptoSlate, analysts forecast that the market cap for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could reach $30 trillion by 2034(1)—driven by advances in blockchain, AI, and investor demand for transparent, real-time asset ownership and settlement. “This partnership is about more than collaboration—it’s about setting the pace for a shift in how companies manage capital and assets,” said Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank . “As the world accelerates toward AI, automation, and clean energy, Bitcoin and tokenization are presenting new opportunities. PowerBank and Intellistake are here to take part in that transformation, to bridge traditional energy infrastructure with the demand of the digital economy.” Intellistake and PowerBank are presently evaluating the regulatory framework for tokenization. Any tokenization will be subject to it being completed in compliance with applicable law, regulatory requirements and terms of any underlying agreements associated with PowerBank assets. The actual structure of such tokenization, the assets that would be subject to tokenization, and the associated timeline, have not yet been determined. Intellistake and PowerBank will provide further updates as material developments related to this tokenization strategy occur. The actual timing and value of Bitcoin purchases, under the allocation strategy will be determined by management. Purchases will also depend on several factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of Bitcoin and the anticipated cash needs of Intellistake or PowerBank. The allocation strategy may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason. Intellistake will support PowerBank’s establishment of custody for its digital currency purchases and PowerBank no longer intends to utilize Coinbase for this service. As of the date of this press release, no Bitcoin purchases have been made.

(“Intellistake”) that involves the intersection of digital assets, energy, and tokenized finance. Intellistake (CSE: ISTK) is a technology company bridging traditional capital markets with decentralized AI and blockchain infrastructure, and PowerBank (formerly SolarBank), is a leader in clean energy infrastructure. Together, these two high-growth companies will pursue three seminal initiatives: A Digital Asset Treasury Program: Leveraging Bitcoin as a long-term treasury reserve asset, PowerBank, with Intellistake’s support, intends to accumulate and hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet and Intellistake intends to accumulate digital assets that support decentralized AI, such as FET Token — aligning with the global shift toward decentralized financial reserves. Bitcoin Treasury Management: Under the partnership framework, Intellistake will help manage digital asset operations for PowerBank and serve as PowerBank''s supporting partner for security, custody, and treasury management of Bitcoin. The Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA): Intellistake and PowerBank are evaluating the potential tokenization of PowerBank’s clean energy assets or shares — providing an investment and financing alternative. “Tokenization is no longer a concept—it’s an inevitability,” said Jason Dussault, CEO of Intellistake. “By combining our expertise in capital markets and digital asset custody with PowerBank’s scalable, real-world energy platform, we’re unlocking a new opportunity..” As institutions and sovereign funds increasingly embrace tokenized securities and decentralized asset strategies, the Intellistake–PowerBank partnership centres on transforming legacy energy systems into a tokenized product. According to a recent report by CryptoSlate, analysts forecast that the market cap for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) could reach $30 trillion by 2034(1)—driven by advances in blockchain, AI, and investor demand for transparent, real-time asset ownership and settlement. “This partnership is about more than collaboration—it’s about setting the pace for a shift in how companies manage capital and assets,” said Dr. Richard Lu, CEO of PowerBank. “As the world accelerates toward AI, automation, and clean energy, Bitcoin and tokenization are presenting new opportunities. PowerBank and Intellistake are here to take part in that transformation, to bridge traditional energy infrastructure with the demand of the digital economy.” Intellistake and PowerBank are presently evaluating the regulatory framework for tokenization. Any tokenization will be subject to it being completed in compliance with applicable law, regulatory requirements and terms of any underlying agreements associated with PowerBank assets. The actual structure of such tokenization, the assets that would be subject to tokenization, and the associated timeline, have not yet been determined. Intellistake and PowerBank will provide further updates as material developments related to this tokenization strategy occur. The actual timing and value of Bitcoin purchases, under the allocation strategy will be determined by management. Purchases will also depend on several factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of Bitcoin and the anticipated cash needs of Intellistake or PowerBank. The allocation strategy may be suspended, discontinued or modified at any time for any reason. Intellistake will support PowerBank’s establishment of custody for its digital currency purchases and PowerBank no longer intends to utilize Coinbase for this service. As of the date of this press release, no Bitcoin purchases have been made.

With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin spent the week drifting, sliding about 1.55 % and sitting in a narrow band between 116040 and 121488. That mild dip hides a firmer trend: the coin is still up around 9 % for the month and nearly 13 % over six months, showing buyers have not stepped aside for long. Short-term signals look mixed. The 10-day moving average rests just under 118000 while the 100-day line is a touch higher, so price is pressing on both. The strength index sits near 52, a neutral spot, yet the stochastic reading above 80 hints at a market that could be getting tired. A negative MACD level backs the idea of slower momentum in the immediate run. For the next move, 112681 is the nearby floor; slipping through it could open a slide toward 107232, roughly a 9 % drop from the mid-range price. On the upside, a push past 123578 would clear room toward 129026, about a 7 % jump. Given the steadier gains over one and six months, odds still lean to a grind higher, but the coin needs a clean break over 123578 to reignite the rally.

2025-07-31 10:25:31+00:00,Bitfarms Ltd.: Optimistic With The Buyback Plan And US Exposure Into 2026,"Summary I rate Bitfarms as a hold, highlighting its upcoming share buyback and strategic US expansion as key growth drivers. Despite 32.8% YoY revenue growth, BITF''s significant net losses and rising costs, especially from Argentina, weigh on near-term profitability. The Stronghold acquisition and US energy pipeline are expected to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency into 2026. BITF trades at a fair valuation with potential upside, but execution of the buyback and asset growth are crucial for future performance. I have watched the evolution of cryptocurrency, particularly Bitcoin mining, which has evolved from a small-scale venture to an energy-intensive operation conducted on an industrial scale. Over the last five years, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has increased by 967.82%. Back in 2022, I wrote about MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) as a solid tracker of BTC, and it is up 703.95% (since then). Earlier on, I had focused on CleanSpark ( CLSK ) and its expanded mining activities, including sustainable mining, and the stock has since gained 19.09% (from 2021). In this article, I will explain why I am rating Bitfarms Ltd. ( BITF ) as a hold in light of the company’s buyback plan and its renewed focus on the US as a strategic location for growth. However, I will consider the growth in net losses ahead of Q2 2025 earnings that may hamper the stock’s rally into 2026, if it persists. Bitfarms’ Strategic Realignments Into 2026 Bitfarms, a Canadian operator of data centers and a Bitcoin miner, is set to purchase 10% of its public float (of 499 million shares) in a share buyback plan beginning on July 28, 2025, and continuing through July 27, 2026. This 1-year program will see BITF retire about 49,943,031 common shares. As of July 29, 2025, BITF had a market capitalization of $710.32 million and an outstanding share balance of 557,548,857. At the current price of $1.24 (per share), BITF is likely to spend $62 million in the buyback plan. This change is likely to increase the share price past $1.30, and an increase in the market cap, as it will be seen in this article. The acquisition of Stronghold by BITF in Q1 2025 also set the stage for the company’s expanded opportunities in the US (to about 80% of its North America energy portfolio, against 20% - international), which will prove pivotal in the future. It is all about the vertical integration and control of its power with the US exposure. In essence, a Bitcoin miner’s proximity to ample sustainable energy (in this AI race) is critical for revenue growth and cost optimization. Then again, the reduced rewards for blocks after BTC halving in 2024 also warrant BITF''s growth into high-performance computing (HPC) and AI to create long-term value for shareholders. Q1 2025 saw BITF record a 32.8% (YoY) revenue growth to $66.8 million against a net loss of $35.9 million vs. a net loss of $6 million in Q1 2024. Costs of revenues in Q1 2025 rose to an all-time quarterly high of $67.4 million. This increase is partly attributed to the acquisition of Stronghold Digital and asset write-down in Argentina. Revenues in Argentina declined 40% (YoY) to $6.955 million in Q1 2025 from $11.576 million in Q1 2024. The company also explained in its Q1 2025 management analysis that the supply of electricity to its Argentine facility in Rio Cuarto had been halted, affecting the intended long-term contract of up to 210 MW. In regard to operational efficiency, about half of the company''s revenue ($37.3 million) was proceeds from the sale of 428 BTC (from the total 693 BTC earned in the quarter) at an average price of $87,000. Seeking Alpha Currently, BTC is selling at $118,140, indicating an increase of about 36% (from the last sale by BITF), slightly shy of its all-time high of +$120,000. Despite the high net losses, BITF has developed its culture of paying for its expenses using operating revenues that have been growing into 2026. Looking forward, BITF now has the energy infrastructure to reach the intended upside exposure coupled with rising BTC prices. By Q2 2025, BITF has about 1,166 BTC recorded in its balance sheet, and it has an opportunity to invest a significant amount of capital into its HPC and AI. Further, about 37.7% of its cost of revenues, or about $25.408 million, was attributed to energy expenses, which will be significantly reduced with the acquisition of Stronghold and the US expansion that is set to give a growth energy pipeline of nearly 1.1 GW in the US state of Pennsylvania (in the long run). As of May 2025, the total contracted energy capacity in BITF’s 15 BTC data centers (spread between North and South America) stood at 908 MW. Thus, the operationalization of the Stronghold energy pipeline will help to lower BITF’s costs into 2026 and improve the company’s profitability. Valuation I will use the net asset value per share metric to evaluate BITF since the company has a steady asset cover against liabilities.

Here''s the Latest Research!","As quantum computing becomes increasingly prevalent in our lives, it is reportedly a significant threat to Bitcoin (BTC). It is being argued that quantum computing could one day undermine the cryptographic foundations that secure trillions of dollars in crypto assets. According to Decrypt, Mysten Labs has conducted new research on quantum computing and cryptocurrencies, saying that some blockchains are more unprepared and vulnerable than others. Mysten Labs, the developer of the Sui blockchain, said that their new blockchain is better prepared to face quantum threats. Mysten Labs said that new research shows that blockchains that use the Edwards Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) are in a better position to deal with future quantum threats. At this point, new networks such as Sui (SUI), Solana (SOL) and Near (NEAR) are more reliable against the quantum threat, while older blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) are in a more vulnerable position. This is because older blockchains like BTC and ETH use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), which faces greater technical and operational hurdles in transitioning to quantum-resistant security. Mysten Labs noted that chains using EdDSA, such as Solana and Sui, are easier to upgrade for quantum resistance. Kostas Chalkias, co-founder of Mysten Labs, stated that governments are well aware of the risks posed by quantum computing, as Bitcoin and Ethereum treasury strategies have increased recently, saying: Governments around the world have issued mandates phasing out classic algorithms like ECDSA and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) by 2030 or 2035. It also means that if your blockchain supports sovereign assets, national cryptocurrency treasuries, ETFs, or CBDCs, and if your community values long-term reliability and mass adoption, you will soon need to adopt post-quantum cryptographic standards.” Finally, Chalkias added that Bitcoin and Etheruem will also eventually need to upgrade their algorithms to transaction-secure quantum-resistant algorithms. *This is not investment advice.

The exchange added more than 80 new spot trading pairs during the month, pushing its total number of spot pairs beyond 300. Its futures market now includes over 380 pairs. The boost in activity brought BTCC’s daily spot trading volume to over $4.5 million in the first three weeks of July. According to the exchange, the uptick was largely driven by heightened interest in newly listed tokens such as SPX6900 (SPX), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), Movement (MOVE), Magic Eden (ME), Useless Coin (USELESS), Vine Coin (VINE), and Zora (ZORA). These additions were selected based on emerging trends and trading momentum in the broader market. “The spot market is incredibly dynamic, and we''re making it a key priority in the coming months to drive our continued growth,” said Alex Hung, Head of Operations at BTCC. “We''ve seen tremendous momentum as crypto markets recover, which is why we''ve been rapidly expanding our spot listings since Q2 this year.” BTCC’s spot market has traditionally been anchored by high-volume tokens such as BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, and MANTA. On the futures side, XRP, ETH, BTC, SOL, DOGE, and PENGU continue to dominate trading activity.

The initiative highlights trending assets like SPK, PENGU, and PUMP, and offers trading rewards aimed at increasing user engagement across both new and existing user bases.

2025-07-31 13:15:10+00:00,PCE Inflation: Crucial Data Unveils Surprising Economic Shifts,"BitcoinWorld PCE Inflation: Crucial Data Unveils Surprising Economic Shifts In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where market sentiment can shift in an instant, every economic report from traditional finance holds significant weight. The latest release from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis concerning the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is no exception. This isn’t just a dry economic statistic; it’s a crucial piece of the puzzle that helps shape Federal Reserve policy, and by extension, the landscape for your digital asset investments. Understanding the nuances of the June PCE inflation report is paramount for any savvy crypto investor looking to navigate the intricate currents of the global economy. What is PCE Inflation and Why Does it Matter for Your Crypto Portfolio? Before diving into the numbers, let’s clarify what PCE inflation is and why it commands so much attention, especially from the Federal Reserve. The PCE price index measures the average increase in prices paid by consumers for goods and services. While you might be more familiar with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the PCE is the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation. Why? Because it offers a broader measure of consumer spending, accounts for changes in consumer behavior (i.e., substituting cheaper goods when prices rise), and covers a wider range of goods and services. Broader Scope: PCE includes a wider range of goods and services than CPI. Consumer Behavior: It adapts to how consumers change their spending habits in response to price changes. Fed’s Focus: The Federal Reserve explicitly targets 2% PCE inflation as part of its dual mandate for stable prices and maximum employment. For crypto investors, this distinction is vital. The Fed’s reaction to PCE inflation directly impacts interest rates, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and overall market liquidity—all factors that profoundly influence risk assets like cryptocurrencies. June’s PCE Inflation Data Unpacked: A Closer Look at the Numbers The recent report delivered figures that largely aligned with expectations, yet with a subtle twist in the core metric. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures for June: Metric June 2024 Reading Analyst Expectations Previous Month (May 2024) PCE Price Index (Month-over-month) +0.3% +0.3% +0.2% Core PCE Price Index (Year-over-year) +2.8% +2.7% +2.6% The headline PCE price index increased by 0.3% month-over-month, perfectly matching economists’ forecasts. This suggests a continued, albeit moderate, pace of price increases across the board. However, the year-over-year core PCE, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, saw a rise of 2.8%. This figure, while seemingly a small deviation, was slightly above the anticipated 2.7% and represents an uptick from the previous month’s 2.6%. This subtle acceleration in core PCE inflation is where the market’s attention truly zeroes in, as it indicates underlying price pressures that could persist. How Does PCE Inflation Influence Federal Reserve Policy? The Federal Reserve’s primary goal regarding inflation is to achieve price stability, which it defines as a 2% annual rate for the core PCE. When PCE inflation runs consistently above this target, the Fed typically responds by tightening monetary policy—primarily by raising the federal funds rate. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity, reduce demand, and, in theory, bring inflation back down. The 2.8% core PCE reading, while closer to the 2% target than previous highs, still signals that inflation is not yet fully under control. This slightly higher-than-expected figure could reinforce the Fed’s hawkish stance, meaning they might feel less pressure to pause or cut interest rates in the near term. For crypto, this often translates to a less favorable environment, as higher interest rates can make traditional investments more attractive relative to riskier assets like digital currencies. Navigating the Crypto Waters: Implications for Digital Assets The interplay between traditional economic data and the cryptocurrency market is complex but undeniable. Here’s how the latest PCE inflation report could ripple through your crypto portfolio: Interest Rate Expectations: A persistent or slightly accelerating core PCE strengthens the case for the Fed to maintain higher interest rates for longer, or even implement further hikes. Higher rates typically lead to a stronger U.S. dollar, which can put downward pressure on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Risk-Off Sentiment: When borrowing costs rise and economic uncertainty looms due to inflation concerns, investors often gravitate towards safer, less volatile assets. This ‘risk-off’ sentiment can lead to capital flowing out of cryptocurrencies. Liquidity Concerns: Tighter monetary policy reduces the overall liquidity in the financial system. Less readily available capital can mean reduced investment in speculative assets, impacting cryp",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/pce-inflation-economic-shifts/,MARKET|TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|BTC,Crypto News|Crypto Market|Economic data|Federal Reserve|Inflation|PCE Inflation,BTC,"PCE Inflation: Crucial Data Unveils Surprising Economic Shifts.

2025-07-31 13:25:03+00:00,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Billionaire Investor Ray Dalio Backs Bitcoin as U.S. Prints Trillions – Best Inflation Hedge?,"Billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio is changing his tune on Bitcoin again. The founder of Bridgewater Associates now recommends investors allocate up to 15% of their portfolio to Bitcoin or gold to hedge against inflation and surging US debt. That’s a big jump from his 2022 advice, which capped BTC exposure at 2%. Why the change of heart? Dalio thinks the US is entering what he calls a “debt doom loop” with Treasury projections showing $12 trillion in new debt issuance over the next year. The national debt has already ballooned to $36.7 trillion, and the government is now expecting to borrow $1 trillion in Q3 alone, a significant increase from earlier estimates. For long-term thinkers, Dalio sees Bitcoin and gold as life rafts in a sinking fiat system. “If you’re optimizing for risk-adjusted returns, you’d want about 15% in gold or Bitcoin,” Dalio said in a recent podcast. Bitcoin vs Gold: Dalio’s Inflation Shield While Dalio is still gold biased, he acknowledges Bitcoin’s growing role as a store of value as confidence in traditional currencies erodes. But his endorsement comes with caveats. Dalio flagged concerns about blockchain transparency, code-level flaws, and regulatory oversight, saying these limit BTC’s candidacy as a full-fledged reserve asset. But his main point is clear: when governments print trillions, hard assets matter. And he’s not alone. US Senator Cynthia Lummis recently advocated for Bitcoin as a hedge for working-class Americans struggling with inflation. Key takeaways from Dalio’s updated stance: Institutional investors are buying more Bitcoin. Privacy concerns due to blockchain transparency. Code vulnerabilities could impact long-term trust in BTC. Investors should choose their split between gold and Bitcoin based on risk tolerance. Even Dalio owns BTC personally despite his cautious tone. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) at $118K: Breakout Brewing? BTC/USD is at $118,386, stuck in a symmetrical triangle on the 4hr chart. Volatility has dropped, and the apex is near. The 50 EMA at $118,075 is flat, showing bulls and bears are indecisive. Price has made higher lows since July 25 and lower highs, capping gains, typical of a consolidation before a breakout. Momentum indicators agree with this coiling setup. RSI is at 53, not overbought or oversold. A slight bullish divergence is forming, as the price made a lower low on July 25, while the RSI made a higher low, indicating that bearish pressure may be losing steam. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The candlestick pattern has printed a doji and a small spinning top, showing balance and setting up for a move. A breakout above $120,283 could take us to $122,845 or $125,111. Below $118,000, and we could see $116,513 or $114,532. Trade Setup If BTC closes above $120,300 with volume, it’s a breakout from the triangle. Traders can: Enter long at $120,400 Set stop-loss at $118,000 (below recent support) Target : $122,800 and $125,000 (key resistance zones) This is a clean setup—just wait for confirmation. No breakout? Wait patiently. Triangles trap early movers. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $6M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $6 million in its public presale, with $6,098,717 out of a $7,004,929 target. The token is priced at $0.012475, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction.

2025-07-31 13:30:06+00:00,Solana Blows Past Expectations While BTC Hits Resistance Wall,"Solana has defied expectations, rallying with strength even as broader market sentiment remains mixed. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is facing a critical test, struggling to overcome a resistance wall just shy of $121K. This analysis is powered by Outset PR, a web3 PR agency known for crafting performance-backed narratives and securing premium media placements. Solana''s Price on the Rise With Potential to Break Resistance Source: tradingview Solana''s price moves between $174 and $205, hinting at potential growth. Despite a recent drop of nearly 8% over the past week, it''s up about 20% this month. With the nearest resistance at $220, if Solana breaks this level, it could push towards the next at $251. Current market signals suggest room for upward movement. Solana''s 10-day average is slightly below its 100-day average, indicating some fluctuation. However, an RSI value below 50 and a low stochastic reading signal that it may recover. As optimism builds, there''s potential for a rise of around 10% or more if it breaks above current barriers. Bitcoin''s Future Looks Bright Despite Current Challenges Source: tradingview Bitcoin''s price is dancing between $116,040 and $121,488, showing some recent growth. Though it''s facing a small hurdle at $123,578, optimism is in the air. Over the past month, Bitcoin rose almost 10%, and in the last six months, it climbed over 13%. If this trend continues, aiming for $129,026 is not outlandish. The momentum indicators are stable, though a bit subdued, hinting at a potential upward move soon. While the RSI stands just under 40, indicating Bitcoin is not overbought, the support at $112,681 provides a safety net. Traders are eyeing these figures, hoping for another rally in the coming weeks.

Grayscale Investments, a name synonymous with institutional access to digital assets, has once again captured attention with the launch of its latest offering: the Grayscale Story Trust . This move isn’t just another addition to their impressive portfolio of crypto trusts; it represents a pioneering step into the burgeoning realm of programmable digital rights, offering accredited investors a unique gateway to the IP token, the native asset of the Story blockchain protocol. As CoinDesk reported, this trust aims to bridge traditional finance with the cutting-edge of Web3’s creative economy. Understanding the Grayscale Story Trust: A Gateway to Programmable IP The Grayscale Story Trust is Grayscale’s newest investment product designed to provide accredited investors with exposure to the IP token. For those unfamiliar, Grayscale has a long-standing history of creating trusts that allow investors to gain exposure to various cryptocurrencies without directly holding the underlying assets. This approach simplifies the investment process, handles the complexities of digital asset custody, and operates within a more familiar regulated framework for traditional investors. So, what exactly does this new trust entail? Target Audience: The trust is exclusively available to accredited investors. This typically means individuals or entities with a significant net worth or income, deemed sophisticated enough to understand the risks associated with such investments. Underlying Asset: The trust holds IP tokens, which are the native cryptocurrency of the Story Protocol. This is a crucial distinction, as it moves beyond traditional cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum into a more specialized, utility-focused token. Investment Mechanism: Like other Grayscale trusts, the Grayscale Story Trust is expected to operate as a pass-through investment vehicle. Investors purchase shares in the trust, and these shares represent ownership in a portion of the trust’s holdings of IP tokens. Purpose: The primary goal is to offer a regulated, familiar structure for traditional investors to access an emerging and potentially high-growth sector: programmable digital rights and the broader creator economy. This launch underscores Grayscale’s commitment to exploring and validating new frontiers within the digital asset ecosystem, moving beyond just foundational cryptocurrencies to embrace specialized blockchain applications. Unpacking Story Protocol: The Engine Behind the IP Token To truly appreciate the significance of the Grayscale Story Trust , one must first understand the innovation it seeks to capitalize on: the Story Protocol. At its core, Story Protocol is a blockchain-based infrastructure designed to revolutionize how intellectual property (IP) is created, owned, licensed, and monetized in the digital age. Think of it as a decentralized operating system for intellectual property, enabling programmable digital rights. In today’s digital landscape, managing IP can be cumbersome. Creators often struggle with proving ownership, tracking usage, enforcing rights, and receiving fair compensation across various platforms. Story Protocol aims to solve these challenges by: Decentralized IP Registry: Providing a transparent and immutable record of IP ownership and its evolution, from initial concept to derivative works. Programmable Rights: Allowing creators to embed specific rules and conditions directly into their IP, such as automated royalty payments, licensing terms, and usage permissions. This means IP can be self-executing and permissioned. Fractional Ownership & Collaboration: Facilitating shared ownership and collaborative creation, where contributions can be tracked and rewarded automatically. Cross-Platform Interoperability: Ensuring that IP registered on Story Protocol can be recognized and utilized across different Web3 applications, platforms, and even traditional media. The IP token is central to this ecosystem. It serves multiple functions, including network governance, paying for transactions on the protocol, and potentially staking mechanisms that secure the network and incentivize participation. By holding IP tokens, investors in the Grayscale Story Trust are indirectly betting on the widespread adoption and success of this foundational layer for digital rights. Why is the Grayscale Story Trust a Game-Changer for Investors and the Creator Economy? The introduction of the Grayscale Story Trust is more than just another product launch; it carries significant implications for both investors and the broader digital rights landscape.

2025-07-31 13:41:05+00:00,Limited pressure from unrealized profits spark talk of sustained ETH rally,"Ethereum (ETH) is seeing lower unrealized gains during its latest rally, potentially helping it avoid selling pressure. ETH switched to accumulation, surpassing BTC with short-term demand in July. Ethereum recovered to levels not seen since March 2024, inching up toward the $4,000 level. However, the token is not weighed down by unrealized profits this time around. According to Glassnode data, ETH has much lower relative unrealized gains. In the past year, Ethereum whales were busy trading, trying to achieve a lower average price. During the latest rally, however, some of the purchases were made at a higher market price in a rush to secure available tokens. Despite $ETH trading near its March 2024 highs, unrealized profits are far lower. Back then, #ETH hit +2σ (standard deviations) on Relative Unrealized Profit at $3.98K – today it''s just nearing +1σ. A move to +2σ now would imply ~$4.9K $ETH . pic.twitter.com/TdmCIzp3Pm — glassnode (@glassnode) July 31, 2025 The relatively low metric of unrealized gains may mean recent buyers are more willing to hold, potentially signaling a larger ETH rally. During previous ETH local peaks, whales often sold, depressing the price. Even older holders from the ICO era, or the Ethereum Foundation , were frequent sellers near market peaks. ETH proved resilient, even defying the recent market where most altcoins took a step back. ETH continued its climb on Thursday, rising to $3,832.37. The recent ratio between unrealized gains and the current price suggests ETH may attempt a hike close to $5,000, recovering its all-time high. ETH also reached a six-month peak of 0.032 BTC, potentially reversing the trend of being seen as doomed to always slide in BTC pricing. ETH dominance expanded to 11.7%, while traders awaited a spillover for a wider altcoin market. Spot demand grows for ETH Demand for ETH increases, based on a drive to use wrapped or staked forms of the token for passive income. The Ethereum unstaking validator queue also saw fewer requests after a recent spike. Buyers are trying to tap multiple sources of ETH, including older staked coins or unwrapped ETH. The main driver of spot buying are still ETFs, which continued their aggressive accumulation. Both ETH and BTC are seeing an inflow of whale buyers, as Cryptopolitan reported earlier. ETH accelerated its net outflows from exchanges, showing the strengthening demand from individual whales and corporate buyers. Strategic ETH reserves broke above $10B in total, after the latest purchases from BitMine and SharpLink Gaming . In total, buyers take 413K ETH from the market each week, while only around 15K are minted and retained in the supply. ETH demand may come from the eventual addition of staking and in-kind settlement for ETFs and other vehicles. The requirement for Ethereum reserves may boost spot demand additionally. Additionally, over 35% of ETH is locked, representing 28.3% of the supply. ETH awaits short squeeze to $3,900 Another major driver of the ETH rally is the peak open interest and the accumulation of short positions. Currently, liquidity has accumulated around $3,900, suggesting a short squeeze may drive the price of ETH higher. ETH may shift between $3,900 and $3,600, depending on which side of liquidity accumulation is attacked first. | Source: Coinank In the past 12 hours, ETH saw a shift to short liquidations, attacking $20M up to the $3,800 price range.

2025-07-31 13:49:46+00:00,Altseason in Full Swing? These CryptoQuant Charts Point to Yes,"The long-awaited altcoin season is finally here, said CryptoQuant. The altcoin market, led by Ethereum, is heating up, while Bitcoin takes the back seat. This market shift is evident in charts tracking trends on Ethereum, Bitcoin, and metrics like trading volume and crypto dominance. In addition, these charts show increased participation from certain cohorts of investors as the bull cycle progresses. Altseason Has Arrived According to a series of tweets from CryptoQuant, ether (ETH) has surged 170% from its recent lows and now sits approximately 23% from its all-time high of $4,871. Since bitcoin (BTC) broke out above $120,000, altcoins have been on fire too, kickstarting this cycle’s altseason. Ether started leading the hype after the online games developer, SharpLink, made a bold investment in the cryptocurrency. The company initially bought $156 million worth of ETH. They are now the second-largest corporate holder of ETH, with holdings surpassing $1.3 billion in value (438,190 ETH). As altcoins steal the spotlight and BTC consolidates under $120,000, Bitcoin dominance is falling. The leading digital network now accounts for roughly 58% of the total market share, down from 61% a few months ago. Altcoins are seeing heavy trading, with their futures volume spiking to multi-month highs. The futures trading volume for both ETH and altcoins has hit $223.6 billion, a level not seen in five months. Retail Demand is Back Furthermore, the entire altcoin sector now accounts for 83% of centralized exchange (CEX) futures activity. Bitcoin, on the other hand, sits at 17%, with its CEX trading volume declining as well. Interestingly, most futures trading pairs on CEXs have recorded positive returns over the last two weeks. On platforms like Binance, just 23 out of 424 futures pairs have shown negative returns since BTC reached its new high. This indicates that the prices of most altcoins have been climbing for weeks. One of the most exciting trends in this market shift is the return of retail participation. Retail demand is back and on the rise – BTC transactions under $10,000 have risen by 9.7% in 30 days. CryptoQuant said such signals often precede major BTC and altcoin rallies. However, it is also worth mentioning that increased retail participation often appears towards the end of bull cycles. So, this may be a sign that the bull market is coming to an end, and investors have a few more months to make the most of the cycle. The post Altseason in Full Swing?

Granted that this last dip in dominance has been the deepest in all this time, with the exception of the 11.3% dip going into the end of 2024. With that said, and with good signs of a bounce taking place just above 60%, this might be the last of the big increases from the altcoins as a whole, although the odd few could still continue to outperform.

Is $ETH about to start reversing against $BTC? Source: TradingView Ethereum (ETH) is the biggest cryptocurrency outside of Bitcoin (BTC), and in the weekly chart above it can be seen that the number 2 cryptocurrency by market capitalization has rallied a notable 85% from bottom to top.

The first scenario is that Bitcoin breaks out of its current bull flag and that most investors are drawn back into crypto’s premier asset and there is a sizable flow of value from altcoins back into Bitcoin. The second scenario is that Bitcoin breaks down, and that there is a significant shakeout of the entire crypto market. In this particular case, investors would not only flee Bitcoin, but they would sell altcoins like hot cakes, leading to a plunge in their values.

2025-07-31 13:54:26+00:00,Liquidity Tsunami: Why Crypto Could Be Entering Its Most Explosive Phase,"Michael Howell , CEO of CrossBorder Capital, sees the market entering the final—and most profitable—stage of the current liquidity cycle. According to him, we’re not witnessing typical economic growth; instead, rising asset prices are being fueled almost entirely by a global wave of liquidity . This liquidity isn''t tied to GDP performance or business cycles, but rather to the need for governments to refinance massive amounts of debt. With about 75% of financial activity focused on rolling over debt , central banks and financial institutions are pushing fresh liquidity into markets, creating a loop of rising prices, increased collateral, and even more borrowing capacity. For crypto, this is a perfect storm. Howell believes we''re now in the “speculation phase” , where high-growth assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum historically perform best. As investors pour into these riskier sectors and yield curves steepen, signs are pointing to a classic late-stage rally. He expects this to lead to a blowoff top , characterized by steep, sudden surges—especially in assets most sensitive to liquidity. The recently passed Genius Act could add even more fuel. By requiring stablecoins to hold large amounts of U.S. government securities, the act gives the Treasury a new funding channel while boosting crypto liquidity. If stablecoin circulation grows from $250 billion to several trillion as predicted, that would supercharge trading volume and capital flows into Bitcoin and Ethereum .

Michael Howell , CEO of CrossBorder Capital, sees the market entering the final—and most profitable—stage of the current liquidity cycle. According to him, we’re not witnessing typical economic growth; instead, rising asset prices are being fueled almost entirely by a global wave of liquidity . This liquidity isn''t tied to GDP performance or business cycles, but rather to the need for governments to refinance massive amounts of debt. With about 75% of financial activity focused on rolling over debt , central banks and financial institutions are pushing fresh liquidity into markets, creating a loop of rising prices, increased collateral, and even more borrowing capacity. For crypto, this is a perfect storm. Howell believes we''re now in the “speculation phase” , where high-growth assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum historically perform best. As investors pour into these riskier sectors and yield curves steepen, signs are pointing to a classic late-stage rally. He expects this to lead to a blowoff top , characterized by steep, sudden surges—especially in assets most sensitive to liquidity. The recently passed Genius Act could add even more fuel. By requiring stablecoins to hold large amounts of U.S. government securities, the act gives the Treasury a new funding channel while boosting crypto liquidity. If stablecoin circulation grows from $250 billion to several trillion as predicted, that would supercharge trading volume and capital flows into Bitcoin and Ethereum . In short, both liquidity models and market psychology (as echoed by Raoul Pal’s “banana zone” thesis) are flashing the same signal: a vertical crypto move is coming. Investors watching from the sidelines may want to pay close attention— the cycle isn''t ending; it''s going parabolic ."

A sharp divergence in gains may form. Subtle signals point to a coin ready to sprint while the benchmark jogs. Hidden catalysts, fresh money flows and a tight supply hint at a path few have spotted before eyes catch up. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend.

2025-07-31 13:55:22+00:00,"Abu Dhabi’s Phoenix Group Launches $150M Bitcoin, Solana Reserve in Regional First","Phoenix Group, a publicly listed Bitcoin mining company based in Abu Dhabi, has unveiled a $150 million strategic cryptocurrency reserve, making it the first firm on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) to hold a digital asset treasury. Key Takeaways: Phoenix Group has launched a $150M crypto reserve, becoming the first ADX-listed firm to hold digital assets. The company’s self-mining revenue surged 219% over two years despite a recent drop in output. Phoenix expects a Q3 rebound as Solana and other holdings regain value. The reserve includes 514 Bitcoin and 630,000 Solana tokens, which the company says reflects a long-term commitment to digital assets. “Holding Bitcoin and other strategic digital assets isn’t just about exposure. It’s about alignment,” said CEO Munaf Ali in a Thursday press release . “We believe in the long-term value these networks represent, and our treasury strategy reflects that belief.” Phoenix Group Emerges as Regional Leader in Crypto Treasury Strategy The move positions Phoenix Group as a regional trailblazer, joining a growing list of mining firms adding altcoins to their balance sheets. Its announcement follows BitMine Immersion Technologies’ recent expansion into Ethereum holdings, where it now controls over 625,000 ETH, 0.52% of the circulating supply. Phoenix Group has also emerged as one of the ADX’s top-performing stocks in Q2 2025, with its share price surging 72% between April and June. Despite a drop in mining output, the company’s broader financials show continued momentum. In the second quarter of 2025, Phoenix mined a total of 336 BTC, a 51% decline from the previous quarter, with 214 BTC attributed to self-mining. However, year-over-year performance remains strong. The company reported a 219% increase in self-mining revenue over two years, growing from $13 million in H1 2023 to $41.7 million in H1 2025.

Financial disclosures show Phoenix is managing $16 million in debt and recorded a $29 million non-cash loss tied to asset revaluations and accounting adjustments. Still, the firm expressed optimism, projecting a partial recovery in Q3, driven by gains in key holdings like Solana. Crypto Treasuries Aren’t Really Buying Crypto A growing number of publicly traded companies are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build crypto treasuries, but one analyst says many aren’t actually buying digital assets from the open market . As reported, crypto analyst Ran Neuner claimed that crypto treasury firms are acting less like buyers and more like exit vehicles for crypto insiders. Instead of purchasing assets directly from exchanges, these companies often receive crypto contributions from existing holders, in exchange for shares that later trade at massive premiums on public markets. Skepticism around the sustainability of the crypto treasury trend is also growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms.

The probability of two cuts dropped from 40% to 33%, while single-cut odds rose from 24% to 27% according to Kalshi data.

The volatility coincided with $4.1 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives expiring, amplifying the price swings. Notably, Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller voted against the decision, preferring a 25 basis point cut. Their dissent marked the first time two Fed members opposed the majority since 1993. Source: The Kobeissi Letter This resulted from the growing internal pressure for policy accommodation despite Powell’s hawkish stance. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone recently warned that Bitcoin may be approaching a “sell when they’re yelling” extreme , comparing current market euphoria to historical bubble peaks. McGlone, who accurately predicted Bitcoin’s $100,000 milestone years earlier, argued that gold’s outperformance since 2024 signals potential weakness ahead for speculative digital assets. The timing coincided with President Trump announcing additional tariffs during the Fed meeting, including 40% duties on Brazil and 50% tariffs on copper imports.

Powell’s Hawkish Stance Sparks Political Backlash Powell’s press conference drew sharp criticism from market participants and political observers who accused the Fed chair of maintaining a politically motivated monetary policy. James Fishback, CEO of Azoria Capital, called the session “the most confusing, bizarre, and blatantly political Fed press conference” he had witnessed since 2011. I’ve watched every Fed press conference since they began in 2011. I spent a decade trading interest rate derivatives. Following the Fed was literally my full-time job. Yesterday was the most confusing, bizarre, and blatantly political Fed press conference I’ve ever seen. Jerome… — James Fishback (@j_fishback) July 31, 2025 Fishback argued that Powell was “moving the goalposts from meeting to meeting” despite lower-than-expected inflation data. The criticism intensified as housing affordability reached crisis levels, with mortgage rates remaining elevated due to the Fed’s restrictive policy stance. Senator Rand Paul criticized both Trump’s tariff policies and the Fed’s monetary approach, stating that “markets, not central planners, should set interest rates.” Paul pushed for legislation to audit and constrain Federal Reserve authority over rate-setting decisions. I supported the tax cuts & making them permanent. But let’s be clear: tariffs are taxes too. I want a smaller government, not one propped up by tariffs or a bloated Fed. Markets, not central planners, should set interest rates. That’s why I’m pushing legislation to rein in… pic.twitter.com/7b0Y4YyT1u — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) July 30, 2025 The Fed’s statement cited “somewhat elevated” inflation and “solid” labor market conditions as justification for maintaining current policy. Powell emphasized that tariffs were “pushing up prices” in some goods categories while noting that “changes to government policy continue to evolve.” Powell refused to commit to September action when directly questioned about potential rate cuts, stating only that “we have made no decisions about September.” The comments immediately repriced market expectations and contributed to the broader risk-asset selloff.

The probability of two cuts dropped from 40% to 33%, while single-cut odds rose from 24% to 27% according to Kalshi data. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Bitcoin briefly dipped below $116,000 during the announcement before rebounding above $118,000, while Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies saw losses exceeding 2%. The volatility coincided with $4.1 billion in Bitcoin and Ethereum derivatives expiring, amplifying the price swings. Notably, Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller voted against the decision, preferring a 25 basis point cut. Their dissent marked the first time two Fed members opposed the majority since 1993. Source: The Kobeissi Letter This resulted from the growing internal pressure for policy accommodation despite Powell’s hawkish stance. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone recently warned that Bitcoin may be approaching a “sell when they’re yelling” extreme , comparing current market euphoria to historical bubble peaks. McGlone, who accurately predicted Bitcoin’s $100,000 milestone years earlier, argued that gold’s outperformance since 2024 signals potential weakness ahead for speculative digital assets. The timing coincided with President Trump announcing additional tariffs during the Fed meeting, including 40% duties on Brazil and 50% tariffs on copper imports. ALL during the Fed interest rate decision just now: 1. Trump implements additional 40% tariff on Brazil 2. Trump imposes universal 50% tariffs on imports of semi-finished copper products 3. Trump imposes universal 50% tariffs on imports of copper-intensive derivative products… — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) July 30, 2025 Trump’s simultaneous policy announcements, while calling for 300 basis points of rate cuts, created additional market uncertainty. Powell’s Hawkish Stance Sparks Political Backlash Powell’s press conference drew sharp criticism from market participants and political observers who accused the Fed chair of maintaining a politically motivated monetary policy. James Fishback, CEO of Azoria Capital, called the session “the most confusing, bizarre, and blatantly political Fed press conference” he had witnessed since 2011. I’ve watched every Fed press conference since they began in 2011. I spent a decade trading interest rate derivatives. Following the Fed was literally my full-time job. Yesterday was the most confusing, bizarre, and blatantly political Fed press conference I’ve ever seen. Jerome… — James Fishback (@j_fishback) July 31, 2025 Fishback argued that Powell was “moving the goalposts from meeting to meeting” despite lower-than-expected inflation data. The criticism intensified as housing affordability reached crisis levels, with mortgage rates remaining elevated due to the Fed’s restrictive policy stance. Senator Rand Paul criticized both Trump’s tariff policies and the Fed’s monetary approach, stating that “markets, not central planners, should set interest rates.” Paul pushed for legislation to audit and constrain Federal Reserve authority over rate-setting decisions. I supported the tax cuts & making them permanent. But let’s be clear: tariffs are taxes too. I want a smaller government, not one propped up by tariffs or a bloated Fed. Markets, not central planners, should set interest rates. That’s why I’m pushing legislation to rein in… pic.twitter.com/7b0Y4YyT1u — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) July 30, 2025 The Fed’s statement cited “somewhat elevated” inflation and “solid” labor market conditions as justification for maintaining current policy. Powell emphasized that tariffs were “pushing up prices” in some goods categories while noting that “changes to government policy continue to evolve.” Powell refused to commit to September action when directly questioned about potential rate cuts, stating only that “we have made no decisions about September.” The comments immediately repriced market expectations and contributed to the broader risk-asset selloff.

2025-07-31 14:00:13+00:00,Fed Rate Cuts: Kalshi Traders See Unsettling 29% Odds of No Cuts This Year,"BitcoinWorld Fed Rate Cuts: Kalshi Traders See Unsettling 29% Odds of No Cuts This Year The financial world is abuzz with a fresh wave of economic uncertainty, and astute investors, particularly those in the cryptocurrency space, are keenly watching. Prediction market platform Kalshi has recently revealed a striking 29% probability that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement zero Fed rate cuts this year. This unexpected forecast, reported by Walter Bloomberg and citing the insightful analysis of the Wall Street Journal’s Nick Timiraos, sends a clear signal: the anticipated path to lower interest rates is far from guaranteed, and its implications could ripple across all asset classes, including the volatile cryptocurrency market. For months, market participants largely priced in multiple interest rate reductions, anticipating a return to more accommodative monetary policy. However, Kalshi’s data, reflecting the collective wisdom of thousands of traders, challenges this consensus. This dramatic shift in sentiment is deeply rooted in persistent inflationary pressures that continue to vex policymakers and consumers alike. Understanding the nuances of this prediction and its potential ramifications is crucial for anyone navigating today’s complex financial landscape. Understanding the Kalshi Prediction: What Are the Odds of No Fed Rate Cuts? Kalshi is a U.S.-regulated prediction market where individuals can trade on the outcome of future events. Unlike traditional polls, prediction markets incentivize accurate forecasts by allowing participants to put real money on their beliefs. This mechanism often leads to more precise and forward-looking probabilities, as traders are motivated by financial gain to be right. The 29% figure for zero Fed rate cuts this year represents a significant increase from earlier projections. Just a few months ago, the market largely expected at least two or three rate cuts. This dramatic shift underscores a growing skepticism among informed traders about the Fed’s ability or willingness to ease monetary policy soon. Nick Timiraos, a respected voice on Fed policy, highlighted that core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation – the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation – looks no better, and by some measures even worse, than when the central bank first began considering rate adjustments last year. This stubborn inflation is the primary culprit behind the shifting sentiment regarding future Fed rate cuts . If the Fed maintains its current high interest rates throughout the year, it would signify a continued focus on combating inflation, even at the potential cost of slower economic growth. For investors, this means a prolonged period of higher borrowing costs, potentially impacting corporate earnings, consumer spending, and the attractiveness of riskier assets. Why Are Traders Doubting Fed Rate Cuts? The Persistent Inflation Conundrum The core of the market’s skepticism lies in the persistent inflation conundrum. While headline inflation figures have shown some moderation, core PCE inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, has proven remarkably sticky. This is crucial because core PCE is considered a better indicator of underlying inflationary trends and is the Fed’s go-to metric for guiding policy decisions. What makes this core inflation so stubborn? Several factors contribute: Services Inflation: A significant portion of current inflation is driven by services, less sensitive to interest rate hikes and slower to cool. Strong Labor Market: A robust job market, with low unemployment and rising wages, fuels consumer demand, sustaining inflationary pressures. Supply-Side Factors: Geopolitical tensions and supply chain disruptions can contribute to higher input costs, passed on to consumers. Fiscal Stimulus: Ongoing government spending can inject liquidity, potentially counteracting the Fed’s efforts to curb demand. The Federal Reserve operates under a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (targeting 2% inflation). When inflation remains elevated, the Fed’s primary focus shifts to price stability, even if it means maintaining a restrictive monetary policy for longer. This commitment to bringing inflation down sustainably overrides the desire to cut rates and support economic growth. Consider the illustrative comparison below, highlighting the Fed’s challenge: Metric Early 2023 (Fed Rate Hike Start) Current (Q2 2024 – Illustrative) Fed Target / Healthy Range Core PCE Inflation (YoY) 4.7% 2.8% – 3.0% 2.0% Unemployment Rate 3.5% 3.9% – 4.0% ~4.0% (Natural Rate) Note: Figures are illustrative and designed to highlight the relative positions of key economic indicators. Actual real-time data may vary. The data suggests that while the labor market remains strong, underlying core inflation components are proving stubbornly resistant. This makes the prospect of aggressive Fed rate cuts increasingly unlikely in the near term, ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-rate-cuts-kalshi-odds/,MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|BTC,Crypto News|Federal Reserve|Inflation|Kalshi|Market Prediction|US economy,BTC,"Fed Rate Cuts: Kalshi Traders See Unsettling 29% Odds of No Cuts This Year.

Following a sharp rebound from yesterday’s low of around $3,675, ETH is now trading above the $3,800 mark, regaining momentum as traders eye a decisive move. While short-term volatility remains, the overall structure favors continuation—provided ETH can break cleanly above the $4,000 resistance level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Market Sits Between Accumulation And Distribution This threshold now stands as the key barrier between consolidation and a potential rally toward new highs. A confirmed breakout would likely ignite fresh bullish momentum across the broader altcoin market. Until then, price remains trapped in a narrowing range, testing both trader patience and liquidity depth. Meanwhile, on-chain data supports the bullish case. According to blockchain analytics platform Arkham, whales have ramped up their accumulation, with large addresses steadily adding to their ETH holdings in recent days. This ongoing accumulation trend reflects growing conviction among high-cap players and adds weight to the possibility of further upside in the months ahead. Whale Receives Ethereum From Galaxy OTC As Institutions Double Down Ethereum’s bullish narrative gained further momentum this week after Arkham disclosed a massive on-chain transaction involving a major institutional player. A fresh wallet address—0xdf0A67Ded855F8ea4baB6399690883243c0e2EF3—just received $153 million worth of ETH, purchased directly through Galaxy Digital’s over-the-counter (OTC) desk. The scale and nature of this transaction suggest growing institutional conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential. This isn’t just another whale move. The fact that the ETH was funneled into a new wallet from a regulated OTC provider underscores the strategic accumulation taking place behind the scenes. As traditional finance increasingly integrates with crypto, Ethereum’s utility, programmability, and future role in tokenized finance are making it a high-conviction play among institutional allocators. This heavy buy comes after a prolonged period of weakness. Earlier this year, ETH suffered persistent selling pressure, with price action sliding lower for months. Retail interest faded, and sentiment turned bearish. But while the public panicked, sophisticated players appear to have taken the other side of the trade—accumulating quietly during the downturn.

2025-07-31 14:00:48+00:00,Altcoin Season Loading As Bitcoin Dominance Crashes Toward 60%,"Expectations for an altcoin season have ramped up once again after the latest decline in the Bitcoin dominance . This decline is notable because the last time the dominance saw a similar decline, the altcoin market skyrocketed, leading to the current green phase. Crypto analyst Merlijn The Trader has also pointed out a major development on the altcoin market cap chart, flashing a similar signal that led to the altcoin market rally back in 2024. MACD Crossover Says Altcoin Season Is Coming In an X post, the crypto analyst identified the emergence of a major MACD crossover that had preceded previous altcoin seasons. This MACD crossover was seen back in 2017 before the altcoin market took off. Then again, the MACD crossover appeared back in 2020, right before the altcoin market began its legendary rally that led into the 2021 bull season. The most recent iterations of this major MACD crossover that led to an altcoin season were back at the beginning of 2024. When this metric crossed over from the negative into the positive, it signaled that the altcoin market was ready to take off, triggering an Ethereum price rally and then pushing the altcoin market altogether. Once again, there has been a bullish crossover on the MACD , moving from the negative into the positive territory in the month of July. If historical performance is anything to go by, then this could mean the start of another ‘vertical expansion’. In this case, the altcoin market could balloon quickly and begin a fresh new bull rally. Merlijn outlines in the chart shared that every market bottom has hit the trendline, which has now been completed. In the same vein, every breakout has begun with the MACD crossover, and this time is expected to be the same. Bitcoin Dominance Crashes Again As things like the trendline marking the bottom and the MACD crossover take hold, there is also the bullish development that is the Bitcoin dominance crashing again toward 60%. The dominance has remained above 60% for five months straight, suggesting that this is the level to beat for the altcoin season to begin. In the month of July, altcoin bulls have tried to retest this level twice now without success. However, if the current trend continues, then it could see the Bitcoin dominance break below 60% for the first time since February 2025. The Altcoin Season Index has also been on the rise, moving up to 44, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This means that 44 of the top 100 altcoins are now outperforming the Bitcoin price in the last 90 days. If this index is able to rise to 75, then it would mean that the altcoin season has officially begun.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/altcoin-season-loading-60/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC|LINK,Altcoins|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|Altcoin season news|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,BTC,"Altcoin Season Loading As Bitcoin Dominance Crashes Toward 60%.

Once again, there has been a bullish crossover on the MACD , moving from the negative into the positive territory in the month of July. If historical performance is anything to go by, then this could mean the start of another ‘vertical expansion’. In this case, the altcoin market could balloon quickly and begin a fresh new bull rally. Merlijn outlines in the chart shared that every market bottom has hit the trendline, which has now been completed. In the same vein, every breakout has begun with the MACD crossover, and this time is expected to be the same. Bitcoin Dominance Crashes Again As things like the trendline marking the bottom and the MACD crossover take hold, there is also the bullish development that is the Bitcoin dominance crashing again toward 60%. The dominance has remained above 60% for five months straight, suggesting that this is the level to beat for the altcoin season to begin. In the month of July, altcoin bulls have tried to retest this level twice now without success. However, if the current trend continues, then it could see the Bitcoin dominance break below 60% for the first time since February 2025. The Altcoin Season Index has also been on the rise, moving up to 44, according to data from CoinMarketCap. This means that 44 of the top 100 altcoins are now outperforming the Bitcoin price in the last 90 days. If this index is able to rise to 75, then it would mean that the altcoin season has officially begun."

2025-07-31 14:05:11+00:00,US Stock Market Rebound: A Beacon of Optimism for Investors,"BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Rebound: A Beacon of Optimism for Investors In the dynamic world of finance, every ripple in one market can create waves in another. Today, the news from traditional financial arenas is buzzing with positive sentiment: U.S. stock markets have opened notably higher. For many, this signals a potential shift in investor confidence and a broader sense of optimism. But what does this US Stock Market Rebound truly signify, especially for those navigating the often-volatile waters of cryptocurrency? Understanding the Current US Stock Market Rebound The latest figures from the U.S. stock exchanges paint a clear picture of an encouraging start to the trading day. Major indices are showing significant gains, reflecting a collective upward momentum: S&P500: +0.82% – This broad market index, often considered a benchmark for the health of the U.S. economy, shows a solid uptick. NASDAQ: +1.55% – Dominated by technology and growth stocks, NASDAQ’s strong performance suggests renewed investor appetite for higher-risk, higher-reward assets. Dow: +0.17% – The Dow Jones Industrial Average, representing 30 large U.S. companies, also contributes to the positive sentiment, albeit with a more modest gain. This widespread positive movement across different sectors of the U.S. stock market is more than just a number; it reflects a confluence of factors that could be driving this newfound optimism. From improving economic data to corporate earnings surprises, or even shifts in monetary policy expectations, a positive opening often signals underlying strength or a belief in future growth. Why Does Traditional Market Performance Matter for Crypto? It’s a common misconception that cryptocurrency markets operate in a vacuum, entirely detached from traditional financial systems. In reality, the interconnectedness is undeniable. The US Stock Market Rebound , while seemingly unrelated to digital assets, can have profound ripple effects. Here’s why: Investor Sentiment: The Universal Driver At its core, both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies are driven by investor sentiment. When confidence is high in the broader market, investors are generally more willing to take on risk. A positive outlook in the stock market can translate into a ‘risk-on’ environment, where investors are more inclined to allocate capital to assets perceived as higher-risk, including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, a ‘risk-off’ environment, often triggered by stock market downturns, typically sees investors pulling back from speculative assets. Liquidity Flows and Capital Allocation A rising stock market can create wealth effects, freeing up capital for diversification into other asset classes. Institutional investors, who increasingly hold significant crypto portfolios, often rebalance their allocations based on their performance in traditional markets. If their stock portfolios are performing well, they might be more inclined to maintain or even increase their exposure to digital assets, viewing them as part of a diversified growth strategy. Macroeconomic Indicators and Their Broad Impact The factors influencing the US Stock Market Rebound – such as inflation data, interest rate expectations, employment figures, and geopolitical stability – are the same macroeconomic forces that influence the crypto market. For instance, if the stock market is rising due to expectations of lower inflation or a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, these same expectations often fuel optimism in the crypto space, particularly for assets like Bitcoin, which are sometimes seen as inflation hedges or ‘digital gold’. Historical Correlations: A Look Back While crypto markets are still relatively nascent compared to traditional equities, historical data has shown periods of significant correlation. During times of market uncertainty, both traditional stocks and cryptocurrencies often move in tandem, reflecting a unified response to global economic shifts. For example, during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, both markets experienced sharp declines. Similarly, periods of economic recovery often see both asset classes regain ground. However, it’s crucial to note that this correlation is not always consistent. Crypto markets can also decouple from traditional markets, driven by unique catalysts such as technological advancements, regulatory news, or specific blockchain developments. Understanding this nuanced relationship is key for any investor. What Does This US Stock Market Rebound Mean for Your Crypto Portfolio? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, the positive momentum in the U.S. stock market offers a mixed bag of opportunities and considerations: Potential Benefits: Increased Investor Confidence: A bullish stock market often translates to higher risk appetite, potentially drawing new capital into the crypto space.

2025-07-31 14:09:09+00:00,Latest BTC News: Why Is Bitcoin Rising Today?,"Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the spotlight today as its price hovers around $117,000, marking a modest intraday rise and extending a broader uptrend that has seen it gain over 16% in recent weeks. Bitcoin’s rise today can be the outcome of a confluence of catalysts: Sustained ETF inflows creating structural demand Tether-fueled liquidity providing market momentum Macro tailwinds from a weakening dollar and dovish Fed outlook Corporate adoption cementing Bitcoin’s role as a strategic asset Improved market structure reducing fragility during large trades This article dissects the primary drivers fueling Bitcoin’s rally and examines their broader implications for the market. 1. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Fuel Institutional Demand One of the clearest contributors to today’s price action is sustained inflows into spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Led by asset managers like BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, these ETFs continue to attract institutional capital, creating a steady, non-speculative demand for Bitcoin. According to data from CoinGlass, net weekly inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have averaged over $1.2 billion in July, and this consistent buying pressure is gradually tightening supply on centralized exchanges. Source: Coinglass The ETF mechanism also enables traditional investors—particularly pension funds and endowments—to gain exposure to Bitcoin without custody risk, amplifying adoption. 2. Surge in Stablecoin Liquidity from Tether (USDT) Another significant factor is the aggressive expansion of stablecoin supply, particularly from Tether (USDT). Over the last month, Tether has minted over $8 billion in new USDT, including $1 billion in the past 24 hours alone. This injection of liquidity provides traders with immediate firepower to acquire risk assets like BTC. Stablecoin issuance often acts as a leading indicator for crypto market rallies. The market interprets it as a sign of rising demand and capital allocation, particularly from Asian and OTC markets where USDT is widely used. In this context, Tether’s actions have created a liquidity tailwind that supports not just Bitcoin, but the broader digital asset ecosystem. 3. Macro Environment: Dollar Weakness and Risk-On Sentiment On the macro front, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) has declined nearly 11% over the last six months, a development that traditionally correlates with rising demand for alternative stores of value—including gold and Bitcoin. This decline stems from expectations of a Federal Reserve policy shift, with markets increasingly pricing in potential rate cuts in Q4 2025. The resulting dovish sentiment has triggered a renewed appetite for risk assets, benefiting equities, crypto, and commodities alike. 4. Corporate Treasury Adoption Accelerates Corporate adoption is another supportive pillar. In 2025 alone, over 90 publicly listed companies have announced crypto-related treasury strategies. This includes both direct Bitcoin purchases and hedging strategies via BTC derivatives. MicroStrategy’s influence remains dominant, but newer entrants from sectors like biotech, gaming, and renewable energy are increasing. As a result, corporate demand is no longer episodic—it is institutionalizing. These entities are less sensitive to price volatility and tend to hold BTC long-term, contributing to supply absorption and price stability. 5. Market Structure: Resilience to Large Sell Orders Last week, the market witnessed a stress test of liquidity and depth when Galaxy Digital facilitated a $9 billion Bitcoin transaction from a sovereign fund. The trade was executed over-the-counter and distributed across multiple venues—without triggering a major price correction. This event showcases a more mature market structure capable of digesting whale-sized orders without cascading liquidations. It signals that Bitcoin has reached a new level of institutional robustness, further reducing perceived tail risk. 6. Narrative, Perception, and the Role of Strategic Communication While liquidity and macro factors move charts, perception shapes momentum. And in today’s media-saturated environment, how a story is told often matters as much as the fundamentals behind it. This is where communication strategy intersects with market structure—and why players like Outset PR are increasingly central to high-growth crypto brands.

2025-07-31 14:15:11+00:00,Bitcoin Strategy: Robin Energy’s Bold $5M Allocation Signals a New Era,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Strategy: Robin Energy’s Bold $5M Allocation Signals a New Era In a significant move that could signal a broader trend, Nasdaq-listed energy transport company Robin Energy has announced a groundbreaking shift in its financial approach. The company’s board has officially approved the adoption of a Bitcoin strategy , designating Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This decision begins with an initial allocation of $5 million, setting a precedent for how traditional industries might integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. For those keenly observing the intersection of established markets and the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, this development offers a compelling case study. Why Are Companies Adopting a Bitcoin Strategy for Their Treasuries? The decision by Robin Energy to embrace a Bitcoin strategy is not an isolated incident but rather part of a growing movement among forward-thinking corporations. In an economic landscape marked by inflation concerns, fluctuating interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainties, companies are seeking alternative ways to preserve and potentially grow their capital. Here are some key reasons why Bitcoin is becoming an attractive option for corporate treasuries: Inflation Hedge: With its capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be devalued through quantitative easing, Bitcoin’s scarcity model offers a potential store of value. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury diversifies the company’s asset holdings beyond traditional cash and fixed-income instruments, which may yield low returns in the current environment. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, offering the potential for substantial capital appreciation that traditional assets might not provide. Technological Advancement: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with emerging technologies and the digital economy, potentially enhancing their brand image as innovative and future-oriented. Pioneering companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted a substantial Bitcoin strategy , demonstrating conviction in its long-term value. While each company’s circumstances differ, the underlying rationale often revolves around strategic asset management in a rapidly evolving global economy. Robin Energy’s Specific Bitcoin Strategy: A Prudent and Phased Approach Robin Energy’s approach to integrating Bitcoin into its treasury is particularly noteworthy for its prudence and discipline. According to the Globe Newswire press release, the company’s plan is not a one-off speculative purchase but a carefully considered, long-term commitment: Initial Allocation: The company is starting with a $5 million purchase, a significant yet manageable sum for an initial foray into digital assets. This allows them to gain experience and understand market dynamics before larger commitments. Gradual Expansion: Robin Energy plans to gradually allocate up to 50% of its long-term cash reserves to Bitcoin. This phased approach mitigates risk and allows for flexibility based on market conditions and internal assessments. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): A key element of their Bitcoin strategy is the use of a disciplined dollar-cost averaging approach. DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy helps reduce the impact of market volatility by averaging out the purchase price over time, minimizing the risk of buying at a market peak. Funding from Existing Cash Reserves: Crucially, the entire allocation will be funded from existing cash reserves, meaning the company will not incur new debt or dilute shareholder equity to finance this move. This demonstrates a strong financial position and a responsible approach to treasury management. This systematic and cautious strategy highlights Robin Energy’s commitment to responsible financial stewardship while embracing innovative asset management techniques.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Strategy: Robin Energy’s Bold $5M Allocation Signals a New Era In a significant move that could signal a broader trend, Nasdaq-listed energy transport company Robin Energy has announced a groundbreaking shift in its financial approach. The company’s board has officially approved the adoption of a Bitcoin strategy , designating Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This decision begins with an initial allocation of $5 million, setting a precedent for how traditional industries might integrate digital assets into their core financial planning. For those keenly observing the intersection of established markets and the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, this development offers a compelling case study. Why Are Companies Adopting a Bitcoin Strategy for Their Treasuries? The decision by Robin Energy to embrace a Bitcoin strategy is not an isolated incident but rather part of a growing movement among forward-thinking corporations. In an economic landscape marked by inflation concerns, fluctuating interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainties, companies are seeking alternative ways to preserve and potentially grow their capital. Here are some key reasons why Bitcoin is becoming an attractive option for corporate treasuries: Inflation Hedge: With its capped supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is often seen as a hedge against inflation. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be devalued through quantitative easing, Bitcoin’s scarcity model offers a potential store of value. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a treasury diversifies the company’s asset holdings beyond traditional cash and fixed-income instruments, which may yield low returns in the current environment. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth, offering the potential for substantial capital appreciation that traditional assets might not provide. Technological Advancement: Investing in Bitcoin aligns companies with emerging technologies and the digital economy, potentially enhancing their brand image as innovative and future-oriented. Pioneering companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted a substantial Bitcoin strategy , demonstrating conviction in its long-term value. While each company’s circumstances differ, the underlying rationale often revolves around strategic asset management in a rapidly evolving global economy. Robin Energy’s Specific Bitcoin Strategy: A Prudent and Phased Approach Robin Energy’s approach to integrating Bitcoin into its treasury is particularly noteworthy for its prudence and discipline. According to the Globe Newswire press release, the company’s plan is not a one-off speculative purchase but a carefully considered, long-term commitment: Initial Allocation: The company is starting with a $5 million purchase, a significant yet manageable sum for an initial foray into digital assets. This allows them to gain experience and understand market dynamics before larger commitments. Gradual Expansion: Robin Energy plans to gradually allocate up to 50% of its long-term cash reserves to Bitcoin. This phased approach mitigates risk and allows for flexibility based on market conditions and internal assessments. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): A key element of their Bitcoin strategy is the use of a disciplined dollar-cost averaging approach. DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy helps reduce the impact of market volatility by averaging out the purchase price over time, minimizing the risk of buying at a market peak. Funding from Existing Cash Reserves: Crucially, the entire allocation will be funded from existing cash reserves, meaning the company will not incur new debt or dilute shareholder equity to finance this move. This demonstrates a strong financial position and a responsible approach to treasury management. This systematic and cautious strategy highlights Robin Energy’s commitment to responsible financial stewardship while embracing innovative asset management techniques.

An arrest warrant has been issued for the entrepreneur who is believed to be hiding abroad. After receiving thousands of complaints from users of his platform, officials estimated their losses at well over a hundred million złoty ($30 million). Polish prosecutors issue arrest warrant for Cinkciarz CEO Law enforcement authorities in Poland are looking for the founder and chief executive of the online currency exchange service Cinkciarz.pl. Identified as Marcin P., the man who chairs the fintech firm’s board of directors, is currently outside the country. The Prosecutor’s Office in Poznań announced this week it has issued an arrest warrant for the businessman right after a district court in the city ordered him held in pre-trial detention for 30 days, Polish media reported. The decision comes after charges were brought against Marcin in March, including fraud, the PAP news agency noted. According to the latest estimates, Cinkciarz customers have lost more than 112 million Polish złoty ($30 million), allegedly used to fund other ventures. Prosecutors have been working to unravel the suspected fraud scheme since October 2024, when police investigators, assisted by cybercrime specialists, raided the company’s headquarters in the city of Zielona Góra. The operation was conducted after authorities received over 7,000 reports from clients who lost access to their deposits on the exchange. In December, they moved to block 328 bank accounts of the trading platform. Marcin P. founded Cinkciarz (“money changer”) in 2006, when exchange offices were gaining popularity amid a foreign currency lending boom in Poland. It eventually grew to a business with 35 billion złoty of annual revenue, Fakt.pl pointed out in an article about “one of the biggest scandals in Polish fintech.” While the platform did not deal with cryptocurrencies, the crypto news outlet Bitcoin.pl remarked that its story is “another reminder that in the world of finance (both traditional and digital), trust takes years to build and can be lost in seconds,” suggesting: “Maybe it’s time to finally take the ‘don’t trust, verify’ idea seriously, not just in the context of the cryptocurrency world, but across all financial services?” “112 million and thousands of hurt customers are the price paid for overly easy trust and a lack of proper oversight,” added the portal, which has recently published critical posts about Poland’s upcoming crypto regulations . Fugitive fintech exec yet to be found and arrested The Polish court has accepted the prosecutors’ conclusion that the gathered evidence is sufficient to convict the suspect. It also acknowledged the potential for a harsh penalty, as the crimes he is accused of can bring him up to 25 years in prison. But Marcin P. is yet to be apprehended and questioned as he is not in Poland, and the court also admitted there’s a high risk of him evading justice. According to the financial news portal Bankier.pl, the CEO has left for the United States. This has been confirmed by a group of Cinkciarz customers who analyzed photos posted by him and his wife on social media about six months ago. The Polish entrepreneur has previously described the developments surrounding his company as a “media spectacle.” The report quotes a comment he made to a LinkedIn post in June, calling Cinkciarz a pyramid scheme, in which he arrogantly stated: “I’ve already beaten the giant Mastercard 12 times, so I can easily deal with the pathology of the Polish system … And I advise everyone else to refrain from making hasty judgments.” Poland likely to seek red notice from Interpol for Marcin Adam Szewc, a lawyer from the Chmielniak Adwokaci law firm, told Bankier he expects Polish officials to ask Interpol to issue a “red notice” alert for Marcin’s arrest, which will allow U.S. counterparts to detain him until an extradition request is submitted. In March, Polish police arrested Robert G., a member of Cinkciarz’s management board, and charged him with complicity in committing fraud. Then, in May, the company’s chief accountant, Monika J., was also detained. Poland’s Financial Supervision Authority (KNF) has revoked the payment services license of Conotoxia, an entity associated with Cinkciarz, whose bank accounts were blocked, too.

In an appearance on The Wolf of All Streets YouTube channel, Sigel says that DAT companies holding various altcoins are going to keep sprouting as long as the price of Bitcoin remains bullish. “I think it will continue to the smaller cap coins until Bitcoin sells off. And then this stuff will close up completely… There will be no new companies. And then we will kind of play in the existing sandbox.” According to Sigel, a Bitcoin sell-off could lead to the multiple of net asset value (MNAV) of some of the existing DAT firms trading below one. An MNAV below one suggests that the stock of the crypto treasury company is trading at a discount, while an MNAV above one suggests it is trading at a premium. MNAV is calculated by dividing the crypto treasury company’s enterprise value and the net asset value of the digital assets in its balance sheet. “I think some of those will go under 1x MNAV. Then there will be a bifurcation between who draws a line in the sand and says, ‘look, we’re not going to dilute below 1x MNAV, we may even buy back stock.’ Those will be the survivors.

2025-07-31 14:32:06+00:00,Best Crypto Presales to Invest In: Why Experts Say This Insider Coin Feels Like Bitcoin in 2017,"As crypto markets mature, the appetite for early-stage opportunities has never been stronger, but not all presales are created equal. While many rely on speculative roadmaps and future promises, a handful of standout projects are delivering live value before launch. One of the most talked-about contenders in this space is BlockchainFX (BFX), a presale-stage token tied to a fully operational multi-asset trading platform. With over $4.5 million already raised, daily staking rewards in USDT, and access to 500+ tradable assets, BlockchainFX is making the case to be one of the best crypto presales to invest in for 2025. What Is BlockchainFX? BlockchainFX is a next-generation crypto trading platform designed to unify digital and traditional finance. It gives users access to a wide range of markets, including crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, commodities, and bonds. All from one easy to use app. Unlike most presales that promote a yet-to-be-built product, BlockchainFX is already live in beta with over 10,000 users. More importantly, it offers real revenue-sharing from the start: holders of its native $BFX token receive daily staking rewards in both USDT and BFX, generated from actual platform trading volume. This model positions BlockchainFX as the first crypto presale where users earn yield before token launch, making it a rare example of real-time utility meeting early-stage opportunity. Why BlockchainFX Is One of the Best Crypto Presales to Invest In BlockchainFX separates itself from the typical presale model through five defining features: Live platform utility with over 10,000 beta users already active.

How BlockchainFX Works BlockchainFX is built on a circular economy that rewards activity and reduces supply. Every time a trade is executed on the platform, this is how the fee distribution works: 50% of fees are distributed as daily USDT and BFX staking rewards to holders. 20% of fees fund daily buybacks of $BFX on the open market. 50% of those bought-back tokens are burned permanently—lowering the circulating supply and boosting scarcity. This model ensures that every trade benefits the ecosystem—and the investors—whether you’re actively trading or simply holding. Key Features and Investor Benefits To better understand how BlockchainFX translates features into real investor value, here’s a breakdown: 📊 Feature-to-Benefit Table Feature Benefit to Investor Trade 500+ Assets Access diverse global markets without switching platforms Real-Time USDT Rewards Earn passive income from live trading volume during and after presale Up to 70% Fee Redistribution Share in platform success through generous staking yields Presale Entry Price ($0.017) High potential for appreciation before $0.05 launch Advanced Security & Audits Confidence in platform integrity and smart contract safety BFX Visa Card (Metal/Gold) Spend rewards globally with luxury card options Daily Buybacks & Token Burns Continuous demand creation and supply reduction to support price Multi-Asset Platform (Crypto, Forex…) Engage with traditional finance using a Web3-native interface What Makes BFX Different To Any Other Crypto Presale? Most crypto presales follow a standard approach: raise capital with a whitepaper and roadmap, promise a product months down the line, and offer no rewards until the token hits an exchange. In the meantime, investor capital sits idle, often with no return and little transparency. BlockchainFX breaks that model entirely. The platform is already live. Trading is happening now. And rewards are being distributed to presale buyers today. This changes the game for investors: Immediate Utility : While most tokens serve no purpose until listing, BFX holders can stake and earn instantly. Live Revenue Sharing : Instead of speculative growth, BlockchainFX generates daily returns from real platform fees. No Idle Capital : Investor funds begin generating yield right away, up to 90% APY in USDT and BFX combined. Exclusive Perks : Early buyers unlock bonus tokens, limited-edition BFX Visa cards, NFTs, and up to $25,000 in trading credits. By combining real-time income with early token access, BlockchainFX is offering something few projects ever manage: a presale that rewards participation today, not just promises returns tomorrow.

As crypto markets mature, the appetite for early-stage opportunities has never been stronger, but not all presales are created equal. While many rely on speculative roadmaps and future promises, a handful of standout projects are delivering live value before launch. One of the most talked-about contenders in this space is BlockchainFX (BFX), a presale-stage token tied to a fully operational multi-asset trading platform. With over $4.5 million already raised, daily staking rewards in USDT, and access to 500+ tradable assets, BlockchainFX is making the case to be one of the best crypto presales to invest in for 2025. What Is BlockchainFX? BlockchainFX is a next-generation crypto trading platform designed to unify digital and traditional finance. It gives users access to a wide range of markets, including crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs, commodities, and bonds. All from one easy to use app. Unlike most presales that promote a yet-to-be-built product, BlockchainFX is already live in beta with over 10,000 users. More importantly, it offers real revenue-sharing from the start: holders of its native $BFX token receive daily staking rewards in both USDT and BFX, generated from actual platform trading volume. This model positions BlockchainFX as the first crypto presale where users earn yield before token launch, making it a rare example of real-time utility meeting early-stage opportunity. Why BlockchainFX Is One of the Best Crypto Presales to Invest In BlockchainFX separates itself from the typical presale model through five defining features: Live platform utility with over 10,000 beta users already active. Daily passive income through staking rewards, paid in USDT and BFX. Up to 70% of trading fees redistributed to BFX token holders. Entry price at $0.017 , with a confirmed launch price of $0.05.

2025-07-31 14:49:54+00:00,Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Remains Rangebound Despite Positive Macro Developments,"Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a marginal recovery during the ongoing session, reclaiming $118,000 and moving to its current level of $118,413. Price action has remained weak as investors brace for lower levels despite bullish macro data. According to QCP Capital, BTC’s muted response to positive macro developments indicated classic “late cycle behavior.” US Still Planning Bitcoin Reserve White House digital assets chief Bo Hines has confirmed that the Trump administration remains committed to creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve despite it getting only a brief mention in the recently published crypto policy report. Hines, the executive director of President Trump’s Council of Advisors on Digital Assets, stated, “We do believe in accumulation. We have it, it’s been established [...] we also have the strategic national digital assets stockpile.” He added that Bitcoin is in a class of its own, and that everyone recognizes that. Hines also added that the administration wants to “give credence” to the work and developments happening across other ecosystems. However, he did not mention other platforms or digital assets. Explaining the delay, Hines stated that building the infrastructure takes time and labor to ensure things are done the right way. “I think that people will be very pleased with the direction that we are going, and we’ll start moving on that in short order.” The strategic Bitcoin reserve only found a short mention in the White House crypto report. According to Hines, the priorities and focus of the report were to create a robust regulatory framework. “We understand the importance of the strategic Bitcoin reserve, we’re enormous fans of Bitcoin and the Bitcoin community, we want to deliver for them as well, and I’m certain that we will.” Hines also added that the US government is committed to getting as much BTC as it possibly can. “There are several reasons we’re not disclosing that right now, there might be a time when we do, but I will say we want as much as we can possibly get [...] and we’re going to continue to work on that.” Bitcoin Miner Phoenix Group Launches Crypto Treasury Abu Dhabi-based Phoenix Group has launched a $150 million strategic cryptocurrency reserve. The firm is the first publicly listed company on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX) to create a digital asset treasury. The company revealed that the reserve comprises 514 BTC and 630,000 SOL. Munaf Ali, co-founder and CEO of Phoenix Group, stated, “Holding Bitcoin and other strategic digital assets isn’t just about exposure. It’s about alignment. We believe in the long-term value these networks represent, and our treasury strategy reflects that belief.” The company was one of the most traded and best-performing stocks on the ADX in the second quarter of 2025, with its share price rising over 72% between April and June. Bitcoin mining companies like Phoenix Group are increasingly considering adding altcoins to their balance sheets, indicating growing institutional demand for assets beyond Bitcoin . Mara Holdings Completes $650M Deal To Buy More Bitcoin (BTC) Bitcoin mining firm Mara Holdings has completed a deal to raise $950 million by issuing interest-free senior convertible notes to private qualified investors. The firm plans to use the funds to purchase additional Bitcoin. Mara Holdings is the world’s largest Bitcoin mining firm. It is also the second-largest publicly listed holder of Bitcoin, with a stash of over 50,000 BTC , second only to Michael Saylor’s Strategy. The company will attempt to close the lead created by Strategy, with many speculating that the company could pivot to a Bitcoin treasury strategy. Mara Holdings stated in its press release, “The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were approximately $940.5 million. Mara expects to use the remainder of the net proceeds to acquire additional bitcoin and for general corporate purposes.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to build momentum, with the price hovering around $118,000. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up during the ongoing session, trading around $118,435. BTC remains rangebound, trading between $116,000 and $120,000 for over two weeks. Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital noted that while new all-time highs are a possibility, BTC’s failure to revisit all-time highs warrants caution. “New highs remain a strong possibility over the medium term. Till Bitcoin’s failure to revisit its all-time highs above $122,800, witnessed earlier this month, flies in the face of continued institutional inflows and favourable regulatory developments. Caution is warranted. Price action has failed to respond meaningfully to a string of positive headlines.” According to QCP Capital analysts, short-term exhaustion and a price barely reacting to positive catalysts could be a textbook sign of “late cycle behavior.” “The crypto market is at a critical juncture.

2025-07-31 14:51:27+00:00,"Crypto adoption surges among CFOs at billion-dollar firms, Deloitte survey shows","Cryptocurrency is no longer a fringe financial asset—it is now a strategic consideration for the world’s largest corporations. According to Deloitte’s Q2 2025 CFO Signals survey , 99% of chief financial officers at companies generating over $1 billion in annual revenue expect crypto to become part of their long-term business operations. This signals a shift in how top finance executives view digital assets, moving beyond speculation into areas like treasury management, payments, and supply chain efficiency. Conducted among 200 CFOs, the survey reveals a layered picture of rising interest tempered by structural and regulatory hurdles. Still, the integration of digital assets is no longer just a theoretical discussion—it is actively reshaping corporate finance strategies. One in four large-cap CFOs expect crypto investments by 2027 Among companies with revenue exceeding $10 billion, 24% of CFOs expect their finance departments to directly invest in non-stable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether within the next two years. Across all firms surveyed, the number sits at 15%. These expectations reflect growing confidence in the asset class despite persistent market volatility. Stablecoins are also gaining ground. While 15% of CFOs at billion-dollar firms overall said they expect to accept stablecoins for payments within 24 months, the figure jumps to 24% among the largest corporations. These companies cite customer privacy (45%) and payment speed and cost-effectiveness (39%) as key motivators for adopting stablecoins in payment systems. Price volatility and policy uncertainty still top concerns Despite this institutional momentum, risk remains a primary deterrent. Price volatility was cited as the top concern by 43% of respondents, particularly in relation to non-stable cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC at $118,641) and Ether (ETH at $3,812). Accounting complexity was flagged by 42% of CFOs as a challenge, especially under current US GAAP standards that don’t treat crypto assets as cash equivalents. Meanwhile, regulatory uncertainty—particularly in the United States—was a sticking point for 40% of finance heads. Ongoing shifts in US crypto policy continue to delay more aggressive adoption, even as other regions introduce clearer frameworks. Use cases go beyond finance, into supply chains and operations While treasury exposure and payments dominate near-term adoption plans, long-term visions are broader. More than half the CFOs surveyed see crypto and blockchain technology playing a role in areas such as supply chain management and asset tracking. Blockchain’s transparent, immutable ledger is seen as a valuable tool for payment verification and operational audits. In addition, crypto is becoming a regular boardroom topic. Thirty-seven percent of CFOs have discussed digital assets with their boards, 41% with chief investment officers, and 34% with banks or lenders. Only 2% reported no crypto-related conversations at all, indicating a widespread recognition of its potential business impact. Institutional exposure widens to Solana and XRP A separate March 2025 survey conducted by Coinbase and EY-Parthenon echoed these trends. Among institutional investors polled, 83% said they plan to increase their crypto exposure this year. While Bitcoin and Ether continue to dominate allocations, other assets such as Solana (SOL at $177.90) and XRP (XRP at $3.11) have emerged as popular secondary bets. Notably, a majority of institutional respondents said they plan to allocate at least 5% of their portfolios to digital assets in 2025. This underlines a broader diversification strategy that is now filtering down to the operational level, particularly in high-revenue companies.

Then, Eric Tomaszewski from Verde Capital Management answers questions about Ether as an investment in Ask an Expert. Thank you to our sponsor of this week''s newsletter, Grayscale. For financial advisors: register for the upcoming Minneapolis event on September 18th. - Sarah Morton Unknown block type ""divider"", specify a component for it in the `components.types` option Ethereum: The Rising Treasury Asset Reshaping Corporate Finance Ether, the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, is rapidly being adopted by public companies as a strategic treasury asset, an evolution that is helping to reshape corporate finance and shift ETH’s market dynamics. Bitcoin has long dominated the digital treasury conversation . Its capped supply and decentralized nature make it a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Ether is catching up, thanks to its yield potential, economics, real-world utility, and maturing institutional infrastructure. Why Ethereum Appeals to Treasuries Ethereum’s 2022 transition to proof-of-stake enabled holders to earn annual staking yields between 2% and 4%, creating a passive income layer that Bitcoin doesn’t offer. The asset has also been deflationary at times, with more ETH burned than issued, supporting a store-of-value thesis. At the same time, Ethereum powers an ecosystem of decentralized applications, tokenized assets, and smart contracts. For corporations, it can function not only as a reserve asset but also as capital for deploying services and infrastructure. The ETH Treasury Wave Several public companies are now building treasury strategies around ETH, following early movers like MicroStrategy in Bitcoin: Bit Digital holds over 120,300 ETH and stakes its entire allocation. CEO Sam Tabar calls it a “flywheel model,” where staking yield funds operations. They plan to add more to the tune of > $1b. BTCS recently increased its holdings to over 70,000 ETH and was among the first public firms to stake ETH as a treasury strategy. Bitmine Immersion is aiming to acquire 5% of total ETH supply . Backed by significant funding and led by Tom Lee, it now holds over 625,000 ETH. Sharplink Gaming holds more than $1.67 billion in ETH, adding nearly 80,000 coins in a single week and pursuing staking as a core strategy. Joe Lubin is a board member and running their ETH acquisition strategy. Gamesquare has allocated an initial $30 million in ETH with approval to scale to $250 million . It also plans to integrate DeFi and NFT-based yield as differentiators. GameSquare sees the Ethereum Network as Manhattan, with a Financial District (DeFi), an art district (NFTs), and more. Investing in it today is critical for future value and use. The Ether Machine , a SPAC-backed vehicle spun out from Publicly Traded Dynamix, is targeting $1.5 billion in ETH as it prepares to go public. The companies listed above all plan to add significantly more. Other companies have just announced their holdings such as ETHzilla . These companies aren’t just buying… they’re signaling long-term conviction and, in many cases, building products and revenue streams directly on Ethereum. One example is GameSquare, whose strategy closely aligns with their audience in the gaming, media, and entertainment industries and sees the connection with on-chain products built on Ethereum. It is important to them to foster financial alignment with their audience. BTCS is implementing a similar strategy to align with its audience, as block building and staking create a vertical stack on the Ethereum Network, resulting in efficiencies in transactions and staking. The Demand–Supply Imbalance ETH’s price has climbed steadily in recent months, and public company purchases are one of the primary catalysts for this increase. In a recent 30-day span, over 32 times more ETH was purchased than issued . That includes buying from treasury allocators, staking vehicles, and newly approved ETFs. A continuation of this trend will create a supply shock. Unlike Bitcoin, where miners often must sell their bitcoin to cover operational costs, Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake reduces sell-side pressure and aligns holders with securing the network. Conclusion Ethereum is no longer just a platform for developers; it’s now a financial asset that public companies are adopting at scale. With built-in yield, deflationary dynamics, and rising institutional demand, ETH is emerging as a cornerstone of corporate treasury strategy. As more firms move from “interested” to “allocated,” this new wave of ETH buyers may help define the next phase of the crypto cycle.

One example is GameSquare, whose strategy closely aligns with their audience in the gaming, media, and entertainment industries and sees the connection with on-chain products built on Ethereum. It is important to them to foster financial alignment with their audience. BTCS is implementing a similar strategy to align with its audience, as block building and staking create a vertical stack on the Ethereum Network, resulting in efficiencies in transactions and staking. The Demand–Supply Imbalance ETH’s price has climbed steadily in recent months, and public company purchases are one of the primary catalysts for this increase. In a recent 30-day span, over 32 times more ETH was purchased than issued . That includes buying from treasury allocators, staking vehicles, and newly approved ETFs. A continuation of this trend will create a supply shock. Unlike Bitcoin, where miners often must sell their bitcoin to cover operational costs, Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake reduces sell-side pressure and aligns holders with securing the network. Conclusion Ethereum is no longer just a platform for developers; it’s now a financial asset that public companies are adopting at scale. With built-in yield, deflationary dynamics, and rising institutional demand, ETH is emerging as a cornerstone of corporate treasury strategy. As more firms move from “interested” to “allocated,” this new wave of ETH buyers may help define the next phase of the crypto cycle.

A cybersecurity firm steps forward, not to break down, but to build up, by challenging the brightest minds to find weaknesses in the strongest digital locks. This isn’t a plot from a sci-fi novel; it’s the exciting reality unfolding with Naoris’s audacious $120,000 bounty program aimed at fortifying blockchain encryption . Naoris, a prominent cybersecurity firm renowned for its expertise in quantum-resistant security, has recently made waves across the crypto landscape. As reported by Cointelegraph, they’ve launched an ambitious bounty program, offering a substantial $120,000 to anyone capable of cracking some of the most critical cryptographic algorithms in use today. This isn’t merely a contest; it’s a strategic move to stress-test the very fabric of decentralized security, pushing the boundaries of what we consider robust blockchain encryption . Why is Naoris Challenging the Strength of Blockchain Encryption? In an increasingly digital and interconnected world, the security of our online transactions and data is paramount. For the cryptocurrency ecosystem, this translates directly to the integrity of blockchain encryption . Naoris isn’t just any cybersecurity firm; they specialize in quantum-resistant solutions, preparing for a future where traditional cryptographic methods might be vulnerable to advanced quantum computing capabilities. Their motivation behind this significant bounty is multi-faceted and deeply rooted in their commitment to pioneering future-proof security. Proactive Vulnerability Discovery: Rather than waiting for malicious actors to exploit weaknesses, Naoris is inviting ethical hackers and researchers to identify potential vulnerabilities in widely used cryptographic algorithms. This proactive approach helps in patching and strengthening systems before they can be compromised. Building Trust and Transparency: By openly challenging the security of these algorithms, Naoris aims to foster greater transparency within the blockchain space. It’s a testament to their confidence in current cryptographic standards, while also acknowledging the continuous need for rigorous testing. Advancing Quantum-Resistant Research: While the immediate focus is on existing algorithms, the underlying mission for Naoris is to accelerate research and development in quantum-resistant cryptography. Understanding the limits of current encryption helps pave the way for the next generation of secure protocols. Showcasing Expertise: This bounty also serves as a bold statement of Naoris’s capabilities and dedication to leading the charge in cybersecurity innovation, particularly in the complex domain of blockchain encryption . Unpacking the Blockchain Encryption Challenge: Which Algorithms Are Targeted? The bounty program is meticulously structured, targeting specific cryptographic algorithms that form the backbone of major cryptocurrencies and secure communication platforms. Naoris has allocated varying rewards based on the perceived difficulty and impact of cracking each algorithm, highlighting their critical importance to the integrity of blockchain encryption . The top reward, a staggering $50,000, is set for anyone who can successfully break secp256k1 . This particular elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) algorithm is not just any algorithm; it’s the very foundation upon which the security of Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions rests. Every Bitcoin wallet address, every Ethereum smart contract, and every transaction signature relies on the mathematical properties of secp256k1 to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering. Cracking this would have monumental implications for the entire crypto industry, underscoring the immense challenge Naoris has laid down. Following closely, a $30,000 bounty is offered for breaching Ed25519 . This is another highly regarded elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) known for its speed, security, and efficiency. Ed25519 is widely adopted by projects like Solana, a high-performance blockchain, and is also integral to numerous encrypted messaging applications, securing private communications for millions worldwide. Its widespread use makes it another critical target for robust security validation. The remaining portion of the $120,000 bounty is distributed among other significant cryptographic challenges, each playing a vital role in the broader digital security landscape. This tiered reward system reflects the varying levels of complexity and the potential impact of compromising these specific algorithms. The goal is not to prove them weak, but to rigorously test their resilience and, if any vulnerabilities are found, to ensure they are discovered and addressed in a controlled, ethical environment.

2025-07-31 15:05:30+00:00,"Top Altcoins Recover after Fed Warnings, Showing Market Stability","Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell chose to keep interest rates steady, but his remarks on escalating inflation risks from tariffs unsettled crypto markets. Traders on leverage platforms experienced a surge in liquidations as sentiment shifted to risk-averse. $200M in Leveraged Liquidations In less than 60 minutes, over $200M in leveraged crypto positions were forcibly unwound. Bitcoin dropped below $116K, with Ethereum falling about 3%, before both partially recovered. Bitcoin quickly recovered – it is currently back above $118K, though it still logged a daily loss of about 0.8%. Ethereum stabilized around $3,750, finishing down approximately 0.6%. Currently, Bitcoin has returned to its starting point, up 0.7%, while Ethereum is up 2%. Powell’s ‘wait-and-see’ approach : The Fed’s next meeting isn’t until September, giving the board of governors two months to analyze and interpret economic data. Powell appears eager to do this. Early odds for a Fed rate cut are at 39%, according to CME Fedwatch . Overall market strength : Minus a rate hike—virtually impossible—the worst-case scenario was simply the continuation of the current situation. That situation looks pretty good—Bitcoin trading is below but within range of its recent all-time high, the total crypto market cap is rising to nearly $4 trillion, and major tokens like $ETH are surging. Altcoins Bore Brunt of Fed-Prompted Dip Altcoins experienced larger swings: $SOL, $AVAX, and $HYPE each declined by 4–5% before bouncing back; meme tokens $BONK and $PENGU dropped around 10%, then later recovered. In contrast, Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) announced strong earnings after hours – stocks rising 10% and 6% respectively – bringing a stabilising tone. Matt Mena, from 21Shares, argues that the Fed’s reaction may lag. With consumer spending weakening, unemployment rising, and real yields still restrictive, continued rate tightness could risk a deeper slowdown. At the same time, if the Fed raises rates in September, there’s still time for a response. And on the Bitcoin front, Matt predicts that – rate cut or not – Bitcoin could soon enter another price discovery phase and move back past $120K. Analysts believe Bitcoin could rally toward $150K if the Fed pivots by year-end. That assumes inflation continues cooling and macroeconomic pressure accelerates policymaker shifts.

2025-07-31 15:11:24+00:00,Japan overhauls crypto oversight as market grows to $2.66 trillion,"Japan is making a decisive regulatory shift to better align with the global rise in cryptocurrency markets, moving oversight of digital assets from the Payment Services Act to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. The change, spearheaded by the Financial Services Agency (FSA), reflects the country’s evolving approach to treating crypto as an investment product rather than a mere payment instrument. It comes as Japan’s crypto trading volumes are projected to double from $66.6 billion in 2022 to $133 billion, even as domestic influence lags behind global trends in decentralised finance and tokenised asset markets. FSA convenes working group to shape legislative changes On 31 July, the FSA held the first meeting of its Crypto Assets Working Group , launching a structured review to reclassify digital tokens. The group, made up of academics, industry leaders, and tax experts, discussed enhancing legal protections for investors and tailoring oversight to reflect the rapid shift in market behaviour and digital asset usage. The group acknowledged that the global crypto market had ballooned from $872 billion to $2.66 trillion, highlighting the urgency for more robust investor safeguards and scalable legal systems. Japan, meanwhile, holds 12.1 million crypto accounts valued at $33 billion, indicating substantial domestic engagement despite concerns over international competitiveness and innovation gaps. New classification to separate fundraising tokens from established assets Under the proposed reforms, Japan aims to create a two-tier system for crypto asset regulation. Fundraising tokens, such as those issued through ICOs or token sales, would face strict disclosure requirements from issuers. In contrast, established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin would remain under exchange-regulated regimes designed to maintain stability, transparency, and risk monitoring. Yuichiro Matsui from the University of Tokyo emphasised the need for modernised frameworks, while Georgetown University’s Shinichiro Matsuo stressed that any future regulation must address security, adaptability, and cross-border cooperation in the evolving Web3 economy. The FSA also intends to address transparency and fraud prevention, with future plans potentially including laws against insider trading within the crypto sector. Draft proposals are expected before the end of 2025, with legislative changes likely by early 2026 to enforce regulatory clarity. Crypto tax policy under scrutiny as fraud risks persist Taxation was another key focus of the meeting. Yuichi Murakami, a tax expert, warned against treating crypto wallets as separate entities for taxation. Responding to industry demands for Web3-friendly tax rules, Murakami pointed out that current systems lack the tools to handle fragmented wallet data, and that separate taxation could open the door to fraud, misreporting, and tax evasion. Murakami shared his concerns on X, formerly Twitter, stating that any effort to create wallet-specific tax breaks must be preceded by clear standards and investor protections. 村上ゆういち@魔界の税理士 @Jeanscpa · Follow 仮想通貨の分離課税については、どこまでを分離課税にすべきか、という論点があって、難しいところ簡単に言うと業界団体→全部(国内、海外、ウォレット)分離課税でええやん金融庁→海外とウォレットは投資家保護できへんから無理やわこれに税務署側の見解も加わるので、収束がつかなそう 1:35 PM · Jul 31, 2025 9 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies The working group’s upcoming proposals are expected to address these gaps by introducing uniform standards that can both support market innovation and close existing regulatory loopholes.

The group, made up of academics, industry leaders, and tax experts, discussed enhancing legal protections for investors and tailoring oversight to reflect the rapid shift in market behaviour and digital asset usage. The group acknowledged that the global crypto market had ballooned from $872 billion to $2.66 trillion, highlighting the urgency for more robust investor safeguards and scalable legal systems. Japan, meanwhile, holds 12.1 million crypto accounts valued at $33 billion, indicating substantial domestic engagement despite concerns over international competitiveness and innovation gaps. New classification to separate fundraising tokens from established assets Under the proposed reforms, Japan aims to create a two-tier system for crypto asset regulation. Fundraising tokens, such as those issued through ICOs or token sales, would face strict disclosure requirements from issuers. In contrast, established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin would remain under exchange-regulated regimes designed to maintain stability, transparency, and risk monitoring. Yuichiro Matsui from the University of Tokyo emphasised the need for modernised frameworks, while Georgetown University’s Shinichiro Matsuo stressed that any future regulation must address security, adaptability, and cross-border cooperation in the evolving Web3 economy. The FSA also intends to address transparency and fraud prevention, with future plans potentially including laws against insider trading within the crypto sector. Draft proposals are expected before the end of 2025, with legislative changes likely by early 2026 to enforce regulatory clarity. Crypto tax policy under scrutiny as fraud risks persist Taxation was another key focus of the meeting. Yuichi Murakami, a tax expert, warned against treating crypto wallets as separate entities for taxation. Responding to industry demands for Web3-friendly tax rules, Murakami pointed out that current systems lack the tools to handle fragmented wallet data, and that separate taxation could open the door to fraud, misreporting, and tax evasion. Murakami shared his concerns on X, formerly Twitter, stating that any effort to create wallet-specific tax breaks must be preceded by clear standards and investor protections. 村上ゆういち@魔界の税理士 @Jeanscpa · Follow 仮想通貨の分離課税については、どこまでを分離課税にすべきか、という論点があって、難しいところ簡単に言うと業界団体→全部(国内、海外、ウォレット)分離課税でええやん金融庁→海外とウォレットは投資家保護できへんから無理やわこれに税務署側の見解も加わるので、収束がつかなそう 1:35 PM · Jul 31, 2025 9 Reply Copy link Read 3 replies The working group’s upcoming proposals are expected to address these gaps by introducing uniform standards that can both support market innovation and close existing regulatory loopholes.

2025-07-31 15:20:30+00:00,Bolivia and El Salvador sign crypto agreement to develop digital finance framework,"Bolivia has inked a historic bilateral agreement with El Salvador to promote cryptocurrency adoption , taking a significant step toward modernising the banking system. The agreement, which is intended to boost Bolivia’s struggling economy and promote financial inclusion, follows in the footsteps of El Salvador, the first country in the world to make Bitcoin legal tender. The deal marks a strategic shift for Bolivia, which is in the midst of an economic crisis and running at historically low international reserves. Through digital assets, the country is seeking alternatives to traditional monetary systems to help stabilise its economy and increase access to financial resources. A new phase of bilateral cooperation The agreement was signed by the interim president of the Central Bank of Bolivia, Edwin Rojas Ulo, and the head of El Salvador’s National Commission of Digital Assets, Juan Carlos Reyes García. The statement establishes a framework for technological and political collaboration centred on bitcoin use and the creation of safe digital infrastructures. The two countries intend to cooperate to pursue measures targeted at increasing cryptocurrency use while ensuring the essential safeguards are in place. The agreement also specifies procedures for sharing institutional knowledge and developing public policies to bridge the gap between existing banking institutions and emerging digital finance alternatives. Rising crypto activity in Bolivia The partnership comes in the wake of Bolivia’s 2024 decision to begin phasing out its long-standing ban on cryptocurrencies—a move that has led to a surge in digital asset transactions. In the first half of 2025 alone, Bolivia recorded $294 million in cryptocurrency activity, reflecting growing public interest and broader adoption of digital assets. As Bolivia navigates this transition, it is looking to El Salvador—a global benchmark for crypto adoption—for guidance. The collaboration aims to support Bolivia in developing a framework to integrate cryptocurrencies into everyday economic activity through knowledge sharing and coordination between policymakers. Addressing dollar shortages and financial gaps Bolivia’s decision is motivated not only by innovation but also by the need to address serious budgetary realities. A continuous lack of US dollars and increasing pressure on import financing have led the country to consider other solutions. Cryptocurrencies may provide a lifeline for small enterprises and households with restricted access to banking services and foreign currency. By reducing its reliance on established banking channels, the country aims to open up new economic opportunities. The agreement envisions digital assets serving as both a practical tool and a policy instrument to increase economic participation. A regional trend toward digital finance The Bolivia–El Salvador agreement is a manifestation of the regional movement towards digital finance as a tool to counter systemic economic difficulties. Such partnerships could become more prevalent as additional nations across Latin America weigh the role of digital currencies in their development strategies. While the road to mass adoption is far from certain and fraught with regulatory and technical challenges, it nevertheless puts Bolivia among a growing list of nations interested in using relatively new technologies and ideas to modernise their respective economies.

2025-07-31 16:00:07+00:00,Spot Solana ETF Race: 21Shares Updates Application After US SEC Requests Amendments,"The race for a Spot Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is drawing significant attention and efforts in the crypto sector, with several asset management companies submitting applications for the fund. As the deadline of approval draws near for the fund, 21Shares has taken a bold step to improve its spot SOL ETFs. 21Shares Amends Spot Solana ETF Filing In a significant development for the Solana ecosystem and broader crypto market, 21Shares has submitted an updated version of its Spot Solana ETF application. Such a move is a sign of an unwavering desire to introduce SOL-based investment products into traditional markets. SolanaFloor, a platform for SOL news, reported the key move in a recent post on the social media platform X, reflecting growing momentum among asset managers to create crypto ETFs that extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the company looks to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for clearance, the updated filing attempts to bolster the proposal and address regulatory concerns about the fund. Specifically, the updated version responds to the US SEC comments on key areas of the fund, such as in-kind redemptions. 21Shares’ Core Solana ETF (the Trust) is sponsored by 21Shares US LLC, previously known as Amun Holdings Limited. Furthermore, it is an exchange-traded fund that trades on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the Exchange) and issues common shares of beneficial interest (the Shares). In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will hold SOL and use the Pricing Benchmark to determine the daily value of its shares. However, it is important to note that an investment in the Trust is neither a direct investment in SOL nor does it give investors direct exposure to the altcoin. Instead, it offers investors the chance to enter the SOL market indirectly through a conventional brokerage account, avoiding the dangers and any obstacles of the spot market . According to the application, “all of the Trust’s SOL will be held by the SOL Custodian,” which is the Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC.

The race for a Spot Solana Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is drawing significant attention and efforts in the crypto sector, with several asset management companies submitting applications for the fund. As the deadline of approval draws near for the fund, 21Shares has taken a bold step to improve its spot SOL ETFs. 21Shares Amends Spot Solana ETF Filing In a significant development for the Solana ecosystem and broader crypto market, 21Shares has submitted an updated version of its Spot Solana ETF application. Such a move is a sign of an unwavering desire to introduce SOL-based investment products into traditional markets. SolanaFloor, a platform for SOL news, reported the key move in a recent post on the social media platform X, reflecting growing momentum among asset managers to create crypto ETFs that extend beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. As the company looks to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for clearance, the updated filing attempts to bolster the proposal and address regulatory concerns about the fund. Specifically, the updated version responds to the US SEC comments on key areas of the fund, such as in-kind redemptions. 21Shares’ Core Solana ETF (the Trust) is sponsored by 21Shares US LLC, previously known as Amun Holdings Limited. Furthermore, it is an exchange-traded fund that trades on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (the Exchange) and issues common shares of beneficial interest (the Shares). In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will hold SOL and use the Pricing Benchmark to determine the daily value of its shares. However, it is important to note that an investment in the Trust is neither a direct investment in SOL nor does it give investors direct exposure to the altcoin. Instead, it offers investors the chance to enter the SOL market indirectly through a conventional brokerage account, avoiding the dangers and any obstacles of the spot market . According to the application, “all of the Trust’s SOL will be held by the SOL Custodian,” which is the Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. The Custodian carries protection from private insurance companies rather than being insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

The bulk of these holdings is dominated by publicly listed firms, with Michael Saylor-led Strategy leading the pack, followed by Japan’s Metaplanet and US-based SharpLink Gaming. Together, treasury companies have amassed 791,662 BTC and 1,313,318 ETH, representing roughly 3.98% of Bitcoin’s and 1.09% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. DATCO Holdings Top $100B According to the latest report published by Galaxy Digital, Strategy alone holds BTC currently valued at $71.8 billion, with more than $28 billion in unrealized profits. It appears that early entry and aggressive accumulation strategies have paid off. Other DATCOs, while smaller in size, also benefit from low cost bases and significant upside potential. A growing number of entrants are diversifying beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. These entities are expanding their holdings to include at least ten other digital assets, such as Solana (SOL), Ripple (XRP), Binance Coin (BNB), and Hyperliquid (HYPE). Ethereum-focused treasury companies are going further by leveraging staking and DeFi strategies to generate non-dilutive returns, a feature not available to BTC-only firms. While the US remains the dominant hub for these companies, international players are increasingly entering the market, owing to “regional capital market dynamics.” Unlike ETFs, DATCOs have the ability to raise and deploy capital more flexibly, which may attract narrative-driven inflows from investors. In the future, DATCOs are expected to play an even bigger role in the crypto industry. But this growth isn’t without risks. Stimulant or Depressant? One major issue is the “reflexive” relationship developing between the stock prices of DATCOs and the price of Bitcoin. When investors put money into DATCOs, these companies can raise capital more easily and use it to buy more BTC, thereby creating a feedback loop. This loop acts like a stimulant during bull markets, which pushes prices higher. But if the broader macro environment shifts to a risk-off setting, that stimulant could become a “depressant,” dragging prices down. A growing concern is that Bitcoin’s price is starting to follow risk-on behavior in the stock market more closely. Galaxy believes that “perhaps this was inevitable.” DATCOs have helped make Bitcoin more accessible to institutional investors, but in doing so, they may be creating a system where Bitcoin depends too much on equity markets – something that goes against the very ethos of being a non-correlated asset.

2025-07-31 16:30:11+00:00,Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit-Taking Waves: What Every Investor Needs to Know,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit-Taking Waves: What Every Investor Needs to Know Have you ever wondered about the ebb and flow of the cryptocurrency market, particularly when it comes to the world’s leading digital asset? The journey of Bitcoin is often characterized by exhilarating highs and sometimes dramatic corrections. Lately, the spotlight has been on a significant phenomenon: Bitcoin profit-taking . This isn’t just a casual sale; it’s a strategic move by major players that can send ripples across the entire market. Understanding these cycles is absolutely crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital finance. Understanding Bitcoin Profit-Taking: Why Does It Happen? At its core, Bitcoin profit-taking refers to the act of investors selling their Bitcoin holdings after a period of price appreciation to ‘realize’ or lock in their gains. It’s a natural part of any financial market, but in the volatile crypto space, these events can be particularly pronounced. When Bitcoin’s price surges, early investors, large holders (often called ‘whales’), and even retail traders see an opportunity to cash out some of their holdings. This behavior is driven by several factors: Risk Management: Investors might sell a portion of their holdings to reduce their overall exposure and secure profits, especially after significant rallies. Market Psychology: The fear of missing out (FOMO) can drive prices up, but eventually, the fear of losing gains can trigger selling. Strategic Rebalancing: Large institutions and sophisticated investors often rebalance their portfolios to maintain a desired asset allocation. Meeting Financial Goals: For many, investing in Bitcoin is a long-term strategy, but short-term profit-taking can help meet immediate financial needs or fund other investments. These profit-taking events are not necessarily a sign of market weakness, but rather a normal, cyclical behavior that indicates a maturing market where participants are actively managing their positions. The Anatomy of Bitcoin’s Recent Profit-Taking Waves: A Closer Look According to recent insights from CryptoQuant on X, Bitcoin has just experienced its third major profit-taking wave of this bull cycle. This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a recurring pattern that savvy investors observe closely. The data reveals a significant surge in realized profits, with an estimated $6–8 billion being taken off the table in late July alone. This staggering figure highlights the scale of capital movement within the Bitcoin ecosystem. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the previous instances of substantial Bitcoin profit-taking during this cycle: December 2023: The first notable wave occurred as Bitcoin began its ascent from lower price levels, signaling early investors securing gains. March 2024: A second, more pronounced wave followed Bitcoin’s push towards new all-time highs, as many long-term holders finally saw substantial returns. Late July 2024: The latest wave, characterized by the $6-8 billion surge, is particularly interesting because it was reportedly led by ‘new whales’—investors who acquired significant amounts of Bitcoin more recently and are now capitalizing on the rally, especially as prices moved above the $120,000 mark. These repeated instances of large-scale profit-taking underscore a crucial aspect of Bitcoin’s market dynamics: while the asset aims for long-term growth, there are significant points where substantial capital is moved, influencing short-to-medium term price action. Are These Bitcoin Profit-Taking Waves a Cause for Concern? When investors see large amounts of Bitcoin being sold, a common question arises: is this a red flag? The answer is nuanced. While significant selling pressure can lead to price corrections, Bitcoin profit-taking waves are often a healthy sign of market maturity and liquidity. Here’s why they might not be as alarming as they seem: Liquidity and Market Depth: The ability for billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to be sold and absorbed by the market demonstrates its growing liquidity and depth. This is a positive indicator for institutional adoption and overall market robustness. Healthy Correction: After substantial rallies, corrections are natural and necessary. They help cool down overheated markets, shake out speculative positions, and allow for a healthier consolidation before the next leg up. Whale Behavior Analysis: The fact that ‘new whales’ are leading the recent selling suggests a shift in market participants. These might be newer, more active traders rather than long-term holders, whose selling behavior could be different from those who have held Bitcoin for many years.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Astounding Profit-Taking Waves: What Every Investor Needs to Know Have you ever wondered about the ebb and flow of the cryptocurrency market, particularly when it comes to the world’s leading digital asset? The journey of Bitcoin is often characterized by exhilarating highs and sometimes dramatic corrections. Lately, the spotlight has been on a significant phenomenon: Bitcoin profit-taking . This isn’t just a casual sale; it’s a strategic move by major players that can send ripples across the entire market. Understanding these cycles is absolutely crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic world of digital finance. Understanding Bitcoin Profit-Taking: Why Does It Happen? At its core, Bitcoin profit-taking refers to the act of investors selling their Bitcoin holdings after a period of price appreciation to ‘realize’ or lock in their gains. It’s a natural part of any financial market, but in the volatile crypto space, these events can be particularly pronounced. When Bitcoin’s price surges, early investors, large holders (often called ‘whales’), and even retail traders see an opportunity to cash out some of their holdings. This behavior is driven by several factors: Risk Management: Investors might sell a portion of their holdings to reduce their overall exposure and secure profits, especially after significant rallies. Market Psychology: The fear of missing out (FOMO) can drive prices up, but eventually, the fear of losing gains can trigger selling. Strategic Rebalancing: Large institutions and sophisticated investors often rebalance their portfolios to maintain a desired asset allocation. Meeting Financial Goals: For many, investing in Bitcoin is a long-term strategy, but short-term profit-taking can help meet immediate financial needs or fund other investments. These profit-taking events are not necessarily a sign of market weakness, but rather a normal, cyclical behavior that indicates a maturing market where participants are actively managing their positions. The Anatomy of Bitcoin’s Recent Profit-Taking Waves: A Closer Look According to recent insights from CryptoQuant on X, Bitcoin has just experienced its third major profit-taking wave of this bull cycle. This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a recurring pattern that savvy investors observe closely. The data reveals a significant surge in realized profits, with an estimated $6–8 billion being taken off the table in late July alone. This staggering figure highlights the scale of capital movement within the Bitcoin ecosystem. To put this into perspective, let’s look at the previous instances of substantial Bitcoin profit-taking during this cycle: December 2023: The first notable wave occurred as Bitcoin began its ascent from lower price levels, signaling early investors securing gains. March 2024: A second, more pronounced wave followed Bitcoin’s push towards new all-time highs, as many long-term holders finally saw substantial returns. Late July 2024: The latest wave, characterized by the $6-8 billion surge, is particularly interesting because it was reportedly led by ‘new whales’—investors who acquired significant amounts of Bitcoin more recently and are now capitalizing on the rally, especially as prices moved above the $120,000 mark. These repeated instances of large-scale profit-taking underscore a crucial aspect of Bitcoin’s market dynamics: while the asset aims for long-term growth, there are significant points where substantial capital is moved, influencing short-to-medium term price action. Are These Bitcoin Profit-Taking Waves a Cause for Concern? When investors see large amounts of Bitcoin being sold, a common question arises: is this a red flag? The answer is nuanced. While significant selling pressure can lead to price corrections, Bitcoin profit-taking waves are often a healthy sign of market maturity and liquidity. Here’s why they might not be as alarming as they seem: Liquidity and Market Depth: The ability for billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin to be sold and absorbed by the market demonstrates its growing liquidity and depth. This is a positive indicator for institutional adoption and overall market robustness. Healthy Correction: After substantial rallies, corrections are natural and necessary.

2025-07-31 16:35:10+00:00,Simplicity Smart Contracts: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Revolutionary Future on Liquid Network,"BitcoinWorld Simplicity Smart Contracts: Unlocking Bitcoin’s Revolutionary Future on Liquid Network The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and at its core, innovation often revolves around expanding the capabilities of foundational blockchains. For years, the Bitcoin network, renowned for its security and decentralization, has been seen primarily as a store of value. However, a significant shift is underway, promising to unlock a new era of functionality. The recent deployment of Simplicity smart contracts on the Bitcoin layer-2 Liquid Network by blockchain technology company Blockstream marks a pivotal moment. This development, as noted by Unfolded on X, isn’t just a technical upgrade; it’s a profound turning point for the full-scale adoption of advanced smart contract functionality within the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. But what exactly does this mean for Bitcoin’s future, and how will Simplicity smart contracts reshape the landscape? What Are Simplicity Smart Contracts and Why Do They Matter? To truly appreciate the significance of this launch, we must first understand what Simplicity smart contracts are. Unlike the more expressive, Turing-complete languages found on platforms like Ethereum (Solidity), Simplicity is a low-level, high-assurance programming language specifically designed for cryptocurrencies. Developed by Russell O’Connor at Blockstream, its primary goal is to create more secure, auditable, and formally verifiable smart contracts. Enhanced Security: Simplicity aims to minimize the attack surface inherent in complex smart contracts. Its design reduces the potential for bugs and exploits that have plagued other platforms. Formal Verification: One of Simplicity’s standout features is its amenability to formal verification. This means that the behavior of a contract can be mathematically proven to be correct, significantly increasing trust and reliability. Predictable Resource Usage: Simplicity contracts have predictable execution costs and resource consumption, which is crucial for a network like Bitcoin where efficiency is paramount. Bitcoin-Centric Design: While not directly on the main Bitcoin chain, Simplicity is built with Bitcoin’s principles in mind, focusing on security, determinism, and resistance to unexpected behavior. In essence, Simplicity isn’t about making Bitcoin do everything Ethereum can do; it’s about enabling a specific, secure, and robust set of smart contract capabilities that align with Bitcoin’s ethos. This focus on security and predictability makes Simplicity smart contracts a compelling solution for high-value applications where trust is non-negotiable. The Liquid Network: The Ideal Home for Simplicity Smart Contracts? The choice of the Liquid Network as the deployment ground for Simplicity smart contracts is no coincidence. Liquid is a Bitcoin sidechain, a layer-2 solution that operates parallel to the main Bitcoin blockchain. It’s designed to facilitate faster, more confidential, and more scalable transactions for Bitcoin and other digital assets. Here’s why Liquid is an excellent fit for Simplicity: Pegged Bitcoin (L-BTC): Liquid uses a 1:1 peg to Bitcoin, meaning L-BTC (Liquid Bitcoin) is backed by actual BTC held in a federated multisig setup. This allows users to move BTC onto Liquid, utilize its features, and then move it back to the main chain. Speed and Confidentiality: Liquid offers block times of one minute and confidential transactions, which obscure the amounts and asset types involved in transactions, enhancing privacy for institutional users. Federated Model: Governed by a federation of reputable cryptocurrency companies and exchanges, Liquid provides a robust and secure environment for specialized financial applications. Existing Infrastructure: Liquid already supports the issuance of various digital assets (e.g., stablecoins, security tokens) and has a growing ecosystem of exchanges and wallets. Integrating Simplicity here allows for the creation of more complex, programmable assets and financial instruments on top of this established infrastructure. The synergy between Simplicity’s secure, verifiable smart contracts and Liquid’s high-speed, confidential, and asset-issuing capabilities creates a powerful combination. It extends Bitcoin’s reach into sophisticated financial applications without burdening the main chain, positioning Liquid as a crucial hub for advanced Bitcoin-centric innovation through Simplicity smart contracts . Revolutionizing Bitcoin: What Does This Mean for the Ecosystem? The deployment of Simplicity smart contracts on Liquid represents a significant step towards a more versatile Bitcoin ecosystem. While Bitcoin’s main chain remains focused on its core function as a robust store of value, Liquid, powered by Simplicity, can now become a fertile ground for a new generation of financial services and applications that directly leverage Bitcoin’s security.

2025-07-31 16:38:07+00:00,ETH Treasury entities now hold over $10 billion worth of ETH,"The amount of Ether held by entities with Ethereum treasuries has now surpassed $10 billion. Data from Strategic ETH Reserve confirmed this, noting that 64 entities now hold 2.73 million ETH, worth $10.49 billion. While this accounts for only 2.27% of the total ETH supply, it highlights the impact that several public companies’ recent adoption of the ETH treasury has had on the total ETH reserve. The data shows that three publicly traded companies hold over 1.3 million ETH and represent the top three holders. At number one is Bitmine Immersion Tech, which now holds 625,000 ETH, followed by Sharplink Gaming with 438,200 ETH and The Ether Machine with 334,800 ETH. The size of ETH holdings by these three companies is even more impressive, given that they acquired most of the Ether in less than ninety days. Bitmine alone holds over $2 billion worth of ETH and has been on an accumulation spree in the past few weeks. The same applies to its closest competitor, Sharplink, which started buying ETH in June. Its last acquisition was the purchase of over 77,000 ETH on July 29, and it remains committed to buying more ETH. Interestingly, the Ethereum Foundation ranks fourth among the biggest ETH holders, with the organization having around 234,600 ETH. Less than two months ago, it was the leading ETH holder. Other publicly traded companies in the top ten include Bit Digital and BTCS Inc. However, other companies such as Centaurus Energy, ETHZilla Corporation, BTC Digital, and ETH Strategy are also on the list. Nevertheless, DeFi protocols and crypto-native organizations remain among the biggest ETH holders. Mantle Network recently disclosed that it holds over 101,000 ETH, while Gnosis DAO, Pulsechain Sac, Golem Foundation, Lido DAO, and Frax Finance also have ETH treasuries. Even government entities are among the 64 holders of ETH, with the US government having 60,000 ETH, Michigan State Government with 4,000 ETH, and the Royal Government of Bhutan with 495 ETH. Companies looking to buy more ETH Meanwhile, the amount of ETH held as reserve assets by various entities will likely keep increasing, especially as several public companies plan to continue buying more ETH. Standard Chartered’s report notes that public companies bought 1% of the ETH supply in June and will likely buy up to 10% of the supply over time. Interestingly, Bitmine Ceo Tom Lee also confirmed this, stating that the company plans to buy and stake up to 5% of the ETH supply, which would amount to around 6 million ETH. He disclosed that the company is actively working on strategies to achieve this. However, the firm also recently approved plans to buy back $1 billion of its shares from the open market and negotiate transactions. This move occurs when its stock value is below net asset value (NAV) and appears calculated to further boost share value before returning to ETH accumulation mode. Not only is Bitmine taking a more measured approach to its accumulation, with Sharplink chairman Joe Lubin also stating that the company wants to buy more ETH, but it will be cautious to keep leverage in check. Sharplink is already considering issuing convertible notes similar to Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) to get the capital needed to increase its ETH holdings. ETH steadies around $3,700 as journey to $4,000 stalls Despite the accumulation frenzy, ETH has seen its price movement stall in the past few days. According to CoinMarketCap data, the token traded as high as $3,877 earlier today has now dropped to $3,774, representing a slight decline. With this decline, investors expecting ETH to climb above $4,000 on the anniversary of its 10 years of existence have had their hopes dashed as the momentum that pushed it to gain more than 100% in three months appears to have subsided.

The digital payments platform seeks to add stablecoin settlement support as global interest in stablecoins takes centre stage. The company’s CEO, Ryan McInerney, said that Visa has been testing stablecoins on its Visa Direct platform to make international transactions faster and more cost-effective. He also argued that currency-backed digital assets can improve inefficiencies in local banking systems in emerging markets. “Visa is building a multi-coin and multi-chain foundation to help meet the needs of our partners worldwide. We believe that when stablecoins are trusted, scalable, and interoperable, they can fundamentally transform how money moves around the world.” – Rubail Birwadker , Global Head of Growth Product and Strategic Partnership at Visa. The payment processing firm said the initiative is meant to build on years of real-world pilots and live stablecoin settlement activity. The firm acknowledged that the additions to its growing list of digital assets will enable the platform to support four stablecoins and four blockchains. Visa said it requires a network that enables interoperability across multiple blockchains. The firm added that such networks will help scale stablecoin-linked cards. The payments platform also acknowledged that it requires a network that enables flexible settlement options that directly accept stablecoin settlements with cards on multiple blockchains.

Visa seeks to expand stablecoin settlement to CEMEA and Latin America In June, the digital payments firm announced plans to expand settlement capabilities in the Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (CEMEA) region. The payments platform also bolstered partnerships with Yellow Card in sub-Saharan Africa to establish its stablecoin treasury and settlement capabilities. Godfrey Sullivan, Visa’s senior vice president and head of product and solution for CEMEA, said the company believes every institution moving money will require a stablecoin strategy. He maintained that the payment processing firm is ready to help its partners through the transformation by helping them build the next generation of global payments. The firm said expanding its stablecoin settlement solution in CEMEA will enable cross-border transactions in USD through blockchain technology. Visa added that the initiative will improve liquidity management, reduce settlement costs, and support 365-day settlements, including weekends and holidays.

These enigmatic entities, holding vast sums of Bitcoin, often remain silent for years, their wallets untouched. But when they move, the entire market takes notice, sending ripples of speculation and analysis across the digital asset landscape. Recently, a particularly ancient Bitcoin whale , a true relic from the early days of crypto, has made a significant move, sparking widespread discussion about its potential implications for the market. What Just Happened with This Ancient Bitcoin Whale? According to on-chain analytics shared by ai_9684xtpa on X, a Bitcoin whale that has held a staggering 3,963 BTC since 2010—a truly remarkable feat of long-term conviction—has finally stirred. This ‘sleeping giant’ has transferred 180 BTC, valued at approximately $21.25 million at the time of the transfer, to an address known to be linked with market makers. This isn’t an isolated incident; the same whale is suspected to have offloaded a larger sum of 330 BTC, worth around $39 million, over the past week alone. The receiving address has a history of interactions with prominent market participants like B2C2, Galaxy, and Coinbase, suggesting a deliberate move into liquidity channels. To put this into perspective, imagine a treasure chest buried for over a decade, suddenly opening and releasing a portion of its riches. The market’s natural reaction is to wonder: Why now? What does this mean? Is this the beginning of a larger sale, or simply a strategic reallocation? These are the questions that arise when a Bitcoin whale makes its presence felt. Who Are These Bitcoin Whales, and Why Do They Matter? In the vast ocean of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin whales are the largest creatures. They are individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of Bitcoin, often enough to influence market prices with their trades. Their significance stems from several factors: Market Impact: A single large order from a whale can significantly shift supply and demand dynamics, leading to price volatility. Liquidity: Their movements, especially to exchanges or market makers, can either add or remove liquidity from the market. Sentiment Indicator: Whale activity is often seen as a barometer of market sentiment. If whales are accumulating, it can signal bullishness; if they are distributing, it might suggest bearishness. Early Adopters: Many long-dormant whales are early adopters of Bitcoin, meaning they acquired their holdings when prices were incredibly low. Their decisions carry a historical weight and often reflect deep insights into Bitcoin’s long-term value. This particular Bitcoin whale , having held its coins since 2010, represents a class of holders who witnessed Bitcoin’s journey from obscurity to a global phenomenon. Their moves are not taken lightly by the market. The Market Maker Connection: What Does It Imply? The fact that the 180 BTC was sent to a market maker-linked address is a crucial detail. But what exactly is a market maker, and why is this connection significant? What is a Market Maker? A market maker is a firm or individual that stands ready to buy and sell a particular asset, providing liquidity to the market. They profit from the bid-ask spread (the difference between the price they’re willing to buy at and the price they’re willing to sell at). In the crypto space, market makers play a vital role in ensuring smooth trading and preventing large price swings due to lack of buyers or sellers. Why is a Bitcoin Whale Transferring to a Market Maker Important? When a Bitcoin whale sends funds to a market maker, it typically signals one of several possibilities: Potential Over-the-Counter (OTC) Sale: Whales often prefer OTC desks for large sales to avoid impacting exchange order books and causing significant price drops. Market makers frequently operate or facilitate these OTC deals. Liquidity Provision: The whale might be providing liquidity to the market maker, perhaps as part of a structured deal or a lending agreement. Rebalancing or Diversification: While less common for such a direct transfer to a market maker, the whale could be rebalancing their portfolio or preparing to diversify into other assets. Custodial Transfer: It could be a transfer to a new custodian service that utilizes market makers for their operations. Given the suspected prior sales of 330 BTC over the past week, the most common interpretation is that this Bitcoin whale is engaging in a strategic liquidation or rebalancing of a portion of its vast holdings. The involvement of entities like B2C2, Galaxy, and Coinbase further solidifies the notion of a professional, large-scale transaction. How Do We Track These Elusive Bitcoin Whales?

According to the newly released Bitcoin Mining Market Review and Key Trends authored by Nico Smid, research analyst at GoMining Institutional, and Fakhul Miah, managing director at GoMining Institutional, the industry now finds itself locked in a struggle with one of the world’s fastest-growing tech verticals: artificial intelligence. AI hyperscalers are demanding huge amounts of electricity for model training and deployment, putting them on a direct collision course with Bitcoin miners, who also rely on affordable, high-volume power to remain profitable. This competition has triggered what the report calls a “power crunch,” forcing mining companies to rethink site selection, energy procurement, and geopolitical risk in real time. The competition for electricity is no longer limited to internal mining rivalries—it has gone external. Major players like Riot Platforms have paused a 600 MW expansion, while Iris Energy has shifted away from pure BTC mining to allocate capacity toward AI cloud services.

Institutional Capital Pours in, but Miners Are Squeezed The report notes that this crunch comes at a time when institutional demand for Bitcoin has never been higher. Wall Street has poured billions into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs , and the U.S. government has officially recognized the asset by forming a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. The result is a paradox: demand for Bitcoin is soaring, but the supply-side infrastructure—mining—is becoming more fragile. While capital floods into ETFs, miners face rising operating costs, compressed fees, and restricted energy access. Hash price has declined sharply post-halving, and transaction fee revenue has collapsed to less than 1% of miner income. Even as Bitcoin becomes more embedded in institutional portfolios and public balance sheets, the ability to mint new coins is under siege. This growing disconnect between Bitcoin’s financialization and the economic sustainability of mining is one of the report’s core warnings. Miners Turn to Financial Engineering to Survive To survive this high-cost, post-halving environment, miners are evolving into financial tacticians. No longer just hardware operators, leading firms are now using Bitcoin-backed loans, convertible notes, and creative equity structures to raise capital without liquidating their BTC reserves. The report identifies this trend as “the rise of the financially engineered miner,” where the ability to model capital stack scenarios is as important as mining efficiency. The shift marks a turning point in how mining companies operate. Access to energy is still paramount, but access to capital markets—and the sophistication to operate within them—is now equally essential. As mining companies adapt to lower margins and greater volatility, their financial survival may hinge on how well they can balance debt, equity, and retained BTC while preparing for further pressure from AI, regulation, and tariffs. Legacy Hardware Feels the Pain The report also shines a light on the economic pressure facing legacy ASIC hardware. The S19 generation of miners, which still accounts for roughly 25% of Bitcoin’s total hashrate, is fast approaching obsolescence. Profitability data shows that S19 units operating at electricity costs above $0.06/kWh are already unprofitable unless the hash price exceeds $60—a rarity in 2025. For operators paying more than $0.05/kWh, even slight hash price drops can push them into the red. While the S19 has been a workhorse since its release five years ago, it is now a liability for many mining farms. The narrowing profit margins are an indicator of how quickly economic viability can shift, particularly in an industry facing both internal halving events and external competition from AI infrastructure players, GoMining Institutional reports.

2025-07-31 16:55:11+00:00,Publicly-listed Companies Bitcoin Holdings Witness Explosive $47.3 Billion Surge in 2025,"BitcoinWorld Publicly-listed Companies Bitcoin Holdings Witness Explosive $47.3 Billion Surge in 2025 In a groundbreaking development that’s sending ripples through both the traditional finance and cryptocurrency worlds, publicly-listed companies have made an astonishing investment in Bitcoin this year. According to a recent report from CEX.IO, corporate treasuries have collectively acquired a staggering $47.3 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) in 2025. This monumental figure not only highlights a significant shift in corporate asset management but also dwarfs the $31.7 billion inflows seen by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) during the same period. This raises a crucial question: What’s driving this immense appetite for Bitcoin among some of the world’s largest enterprises? Why Are Publicly-listed Companies Bitcoin Portfolios Exploding? The surge in publicly-listed companies Bitcoin acquisitions isn’t a mere coincidence; it’s a calculated strategic move driven by several compelling factors. Corporations are increasingly looking beyond traditional assets to safeguard and grow their capital in an evolving global economy. Here are some key drivers: Inflation Hedge and Value Preservation: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating inflation rates, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a robust hedge against currency debasement. Companies are seeking to protect their balance sheets from the erosion of purchasing power, and Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and finite supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional fiat currencies. Diversification of Treasury Assets: Smart financial management dictates diversification. By adding Bitcoin to their treasury reserves, publicly-listed companies are diversifying their asset portfolios beyond cash, bonds, and traditional equities. This helps mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single asset class. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Strategy: Embracing Bitcoin signals a company’s commitment to innovation and adaptability. It positions them as forward-thinking entities willing to explore new technologies and financial paradigms, which can attract a new generation of investors and customers. Competitive Advantage: Early adopters of Bitcoin among publicly-listed companies can gain a competitive edge. It can enhance their brand image, attract talent interested in the crypto space, and potentially open up new revenue streams or payment solutions. The CEX.IO report underscores that this isn’t just about speculation; it’s about a fundamental shift in how corporate treasuries perceive and manage their long-term financial health. The sheer volume of $47.3 billion in direct purchases by publicly-listed companies Bitcoin treasuries suggests a deep-seated conviction in the asset’s future. Beyond ETFs: The Corporate Treasury Revolution in Bitcoin While spot Bitcoin ETFs have certainly garnered significant attention and facilitated broader institutional access to Bitcoin, the direct purchases by publicly-listed companies represent a distinct and arguably more profound trend. What sets this corporate treasury revolution apart? Direct Ownership and Control: Unlike ETFs, which provide indirect exposure, corporate treasury investments mean companies directly hold and control their Bitcoin. This implies a higher level of commitment and belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, as it requires navigating custody, security, and accounting complexities. Strategic Intent vs. Investment Vehicle: ETFs are primarily investment vehicles for a wide range of investors seeking exposure without direct management. Corporate treasury allocations, however, are often part of a broader strategic decision to optimize balance sheets, manage risk, and position the company for future growth in the digital economy. Impact on Market Dynamics: The consistent, large-scale buying by publicly-listed companies Bitcoin treasuries can have a more stable and sustained impact on Bitcoin’s price discovery and market capitalization compared to the often more volatile inflows and outflows of ETF products. This trend signifies a maturation of the Bitcoin market, moving beyond retail and speculative interest to fundamental adoption by established corporate entities. It’s a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a global reserve asset. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Considerations for Publicly-listed Companies Adopting Bitcoin While the benefits are clear, investing in Bitcoin is not without its complexities, especially for publicly-listed companies. Corporate treasuries venturing into this space must carefully consider several challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant fluctuations, which can impact a company’s balance sheet and quarterly earnings reports. Managing this volatility requires robust risk management strategies and a long-term investment horizon.

It can enhance their brand image, attract talent interested in the crypto space, and potentially open up new revenue streams or payment solutions. The CEX.IO report underscores that this isn’t just about speculation; it’s about a fundamental shift in how corporate treasuries perceive and manage their long-term financial health. The sheer volume of $47.3 billion in direct purchases by publicly-listed companies Bitcoin treasuries suggests a deep-seated conviction in the asset’s future. Beyond ETFs: The Corporate Treasury Revolution in Bitcoin While spot Bitcoin ETFs have certainly garnered significant attention and facilitated broader institutional access to Bitcoin, the direct purchases by publicly-listed companies represent a distinct and arguably more profound trend. What sets this corporate treasury revolution apart? Direct Ownership and Control: Unlike ETFs, which provide indirect exposure, corporate treasury investments mean companies directly hold and control their Bitcoin. This implies a higher level of commitment and belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value, as it requires navigating custody, security, and accounting complexities. Strategic Intent vs. Investment Vehicle: ETFs are primarily investment vehicles for a wide range of investors seeking exposure without direct management. Corporate treasury allocations, however, are often part of a broader strategic decision to optimize balance sheets, manage risk, and position the company for future growth in the digital economy. Impact on Market Dynamics: The consistent, large-scale buying by publicly-listed companies Bitcoin treasuries can have a more stable and sustained impact on Bitcoin’s price discovery and market capitalization compared to the often more volatile inflows and outflows of ETF products. This trend signifies a maturation of the Bitcoin market, moving beyond retail and speculative interest to fundamental adoption by established corporate entities. It’s a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a global reserve asset. Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Considerations for Publicly-listed Companies Adopting Bitcoin While the benefits are clear, investing in Bitcoin is not without its complexities, especially for publicly-listed companies. Corporate treasuries venturing into this space must carefully consider several challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can experience significant fluctuations, which can impact a company’s balance sheet and quarterly earnings reports. Managing this volatility requires robust risk management strategies and a long-term investment horizon. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving across different j"

In a new interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box, the Republican politician says that the next US president will have to start reducing government spending as borrowing continues to soar, threatening the dollar’s global dominance. The US debt just ballooned by more than $519 billion between July 3rd and July 28th, reaching a total of more than $36.8 trillion. “Your real question is, how do you keep the dollar the world currency? I think the more that we go in and sanction we’re pushing countries to learn to go around the dollar. I think President Trump has done a very smart move against the BRICS, what they were trying to do. But it all comes down to debt. That’s why debt is our greatest threat to America, and you cannot avoid it any longer.” McCarthy says that if the next president doesn’t materially address the debt, then significant safety net programs like Social Security may face deep cuts. “The next President is going to have the debt crisis… and the challenge is, if you look in the past, the Democrats had the ‘Blue Dog.’ Those were Democrats who cared about debt. They’re no longer there. No one in Congress has been elected saying they’re going to balance the budget. The country has to be educated on this, and Congress is going to have to act, because Social Security in the next administration is either going to take a 24% cut or [it will] do something about it.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-31 16:58:25+00:00,Crypto Governance Crunch: Nearly 1 in 4 North American CFOs Plot 2027 Treasury Shift,"Key Takeaways: A Deloitte survey shows 23% of North American CFOs expect to integrate cryptocurrency into treasury operations by 2027. Beyond financial use, crypto adoption could reshape corporate governance, vendor management, and workforce skill requirements. Stablecoin regulation and CBDC rollouts may influence whether crypto becomes a mainstream corporate settlement mechanism. Nearly a quarter of chief financial officers in North America expect their finance departments to be using cryptocurrency treasury within two years, according to a Deloitte survey published on July 31. The survey, conducted from June 4 to June 18, polled 200 CFOs from companies generating at least $1 billion in annual revenues. Concerns Over Volatility and Controls Deloitte found that 23% of respondents said their treasury teams will utilize cryptocurrency for either payments or investments by 2027, with the figure rising to almost 40% among CFOs at firms with $10 billion or more in revenue. The report noted that 43% of CFOs cited price volatility as their top concern in adopting non-stable cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether. Accounting complexity and controls were identified by 42%, followed by a lack of industry regulation at 40%. Regulatory uncertainty has been heightened by recent U.S. policy shifts. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) formed a crypto task force in January before rescinding prior accounting guidance, prompting the Financial Accounting Standards Board to update its own rules in March. SEC establishes new crypto ETF listing standards enabling approximately dozen major digital assets to gain approval by October through streamlined framework. #SEC #ETFs https://t.co/grlJtGb5tH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 31, 2025 Fifteen percent of CFOs indicated they expect to accept stablecoins for payments within two years, with the proportion again higher for the largest companies. Forty-five percent of respondents pointed to improved customer privacy as a benefit, while 39% cited efficiency in cross-border payments. Corporate Treasury Use Cases Expanding Beyond treasury functions, CFOs identified supply chain tracking as a key application. More than half said they expect to use non-stable cryptocurrencies for this purpose, and nearly as many indicated the same for stablecoins. The survey also showed that discussions about cryptocurrency are becoming common at senior levels. Thirty-seven percent of CFOs said they had spoken with their boards about crypto adoption, while 41% had discussed it with CIOs, and 34% with banks or lenders. Only 2% reported no engagement with stakeholders on the issue. The growing dialogue suggests corporations are weighing not only direct financial use cases but also how digital assets could reshape vendor relationships, treasury systems, and compliance frameworks. At the same time, the trajectory of stablecoin regulation and central bank digital currency initiatives could determine whether CFOs view crypto primarily as a niche investment tool or as an eventual component of mainstream corporate payment and settlement systems. Frequently Asked Questions How might corporate crypto adoption affect internal audit practices? CFOs may require updated audit frameworks to manage blockchain transactions, ensuring transparency, risk control, and compliance with evolving accounting standards. What skills will finance departments need to manage crypto use? Departments will likely need expertise in blockchain technology, cross-border settlement systems, cybersecurity, and compliance with multi-jurisdictional regulations. Could crypto adoption impact vendor relationships? Yes. Crypto-based payments and supply chain tracking may streamline reconciliation processes and provide transparency in procurement and logistics.

2025-07-31 17:00:26+00:00,Bitcoin New Investor Dominance Rises – No Signs of Mass Profit-Taking Yet,"Bitcoin’s new investor dominance is gaining momentum just as the asset consolidates in a tight range, setting the stage for a major breakout. After more than two weeks of sideways movement between $115,000 and $120,000, BTC continues to trade within this well-defined range—building pressure that typically precedes a sharp move. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Market Sits Between Accumulation And Distribution Data from CryptoQuant highlights a crucial dynamic: the comparison between demand and supply from new versus old investors. The current new investor dominance sits at 30%, only half of the “overheated” range of 60–70% seen during euphoric phases, but the trend is clearly climbing. This means new liquidity is entering the market steadily, while old holders are still distributing at a manageable pace. The supply of long-term holders is absorbing this growing young demand without disrupting the price structure. This healthy balance suggests that the market is still in a stable late bull phase, with no signs of mass profit-taking or capitulation from seasoned investors. With Bitcoin maintaining a bullish structure and demand from fresh entrants rising, the coming days will be critical. Bitcoin Enters Healthy Late Bull Phase as New Investor Activity Grows Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared detailed insights into Bitcoin’s market structure, focusing on the balance between new and old investor behavior. According to Adler, previous peaks in new investor dominance—64% in March 2024 and 72% in December 2024—aligned precisely with local BTC price tops. At those points, new liquidity began to wane, and experienced holders ramped up profit-taking. Currently, new investor dominance stands at 30%, which is still far from those overheated extremes. However, the trend is upward. The purple fill on the chart, which reflects cumulative activity from younger coins, has been climbing steadily since July 2024. This indicates that a fresh wave of buyers continues to enter the market, while selling pressure from old hands remains limited. This dynamic creates room for further bullish continuation before the typical euphoria zone—above 60–70% dominance—takes hold. Old holders are still distributing coins, but only moderately. A coefficient of 0.3 means that three-year-old coins are absorbing demand without triggering major volatility. This balance suggests that the market remains structurally sound. Related Reading: BlackRock Goes Heavy on Ethereum: Buys 4x More ETH Than BTC Bitcoin Forms A Tight Consolidation Range Bitcoin is currently trading at $118,413, consolidating in a narrow range between $115,724 and $122,077, as seen in the 8-hour chart. This sideways movement has persisted for over two weeks, indicating indecision in the market. The key support sits at $115,724, which has been tested multiple times but held firmly, while the $122,077 level acts as immediate resistance after a strong rejection earlier in July. The price remains above the 50, 100, and 200-period moving averages, which now align in bullish order—another sign that the underlying trend is still intact despite short-term consolidation. Volume remains relatively low, suggesting that neither bulls nor bears are aggressively positioning at the moment. However, such tight ranges often precede large directional moves.

2025-07-31 17:00:34+00:00,"Top Crypto Gainers in 2025: BlockDAG’s 10 BTC Auction Sets the Bar as Bitcoin Hyper, Nexchain, & Lightchain AI Follow","Identifying the top crypto gainers in 2025 is no longer only about strong utility or widespread attention. The real standouts are projects that engage communities, offer real rewards, and use new approaches to drive involvement. With numerous assets vying for space, only a few have found ways to push past the noise. This article outlines four crypto projects currently making measurable progress, with BlockDAG leading due to its record-setting 10 BTC Auction and impressive presale figures. 1. BlockDAG: Redefining Presales with Its 10 BTC Auction BlockDAG has transformed its crypto presale into a global countdown that breaks from traditional promotion methods. Instead of depending on influencers or hype, the project launched a 10 BTC Auction that offers a reward pool of 10 Bitcoin for purchases made before August 11. Larger purchases secure a bigger portion of the prize, creating both urgency and participation. The response has been significant. BlockDAG has raised $357 million so far, sold over 24.5 billion BDAG coins, and reached Batch 29, now priced at $0.0276. This represents a 2,660% increase since its initial batch. Despite being this far along, the GLOBAL LAUNCH release gives buyers one more opportunity to purchase BDAG at just $0.0016 for a limited period. The project also confirms more than 20 exchange listings, providing day-one liquidity. From a marketing and strategy viewpoint, the 10 BTC Auction is not just a giveaway but a model others may follow. That is why BlockDAG sits confidently at the top of the list of the top crypto gainers in 2025. 2. Nexchain: Streamlining Cross-Chain Interaction Nexchain is among the newer platforms that focus on cross-chain operations without relying on centralized solutions. It allows value and data to move between different blockchains without external bridges. Interoperability is widely considered a key to broader adoption, but it has been difficult to achieve efficiently. What gives Nexchain its edge is the protocol-level design. Rather than making users switch tokens or platforms, it provides a seamless process. Developers can build decentralized apps that work across ecosystems without needing to manage separate technical frameworks. As the demand for cross-chain capabilities increases, Nexchain becomes more relevant. Its user-friendly interface and flexible developer tools give it long-term appeal. Those watching infrastructure-driven growth should view Nexchain as one of the top crypto gainers in 2025. 3. Bitcoin Hyper: Fixing Speed & Simplicity in Payments Bitcoin Hyper has drawn attention for directly addressing two of Bitcoin’s biggest issues: transaction speed and scalability. It promotes a lightweight network that is fast, low-cost, and built for real-time payments. While it does not aim to replace Bitcoin, it complements it by solving problems that have held it back. Its appeal lies in its focus on simple and efficient transactions. Users can send payments quickly without needing to understand complex processes. This makes Bitcoin Hyper a practical option, particularly in areas where traditional banking remains slow or costly. Although still in its growth phase, Bitcoin Hyper’s focus on real-world use over speculation places it among the top crypto gainers in 2025 for those who value function and ease of adoption. 4. Lightchain AI: Integrating AI into Blockchain Workflows Lightchain AI aims to enhance blockchain systems by embedding machine learning models directly into smart contracts. This allows decentralized apps to react to real-time data, enabling them to perform intelligent actions instead of following fixed commands. For example, prediction platforms could update in real time, and logistics chains could identify issues and respond immediately. What makes Lightchain AI distinct is its clear focus on real AI integration. Rather than using AI as a marketing label, the project has launched actual tools for developers to build smart contracts powered by machine learning. More tools are expected through open APIs soon. By making blockchain systems smarter, Lightchain AI offers a forward-looking utility. Although still developing, it has a clear path. If AI keeps shaping digital infrastructure, Lightchain AI could become a vital component. It deserves a spot on the list of top crypto gainers in 2025 for those following AI utility trends.
