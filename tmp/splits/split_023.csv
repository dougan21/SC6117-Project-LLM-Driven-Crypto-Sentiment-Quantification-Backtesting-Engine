2025-07-30 08:40:10+00:00,Forex Market Alert: Dollar’s Vulnerable Position Ahead of Crucial Fed Decision,"BitcoinWorld Forex Market Alert: Dollar’s Vulnerable Position Ahead of Crucial Fed Decision For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, understanding the broader financial landscape, particularly the Forex Market Alert , is crucial. The recent movements of major global currencies like the US Dollar and Euro often serve as harbingers of shifts in investor sentiment and liquidity, directly influencing the volatile world of digital assets. As the world anticipates a pivotal Fed Decision Impact , the ripples are already being felt across currency markets, signaling potential implications for Bitcoin and altcoins. This article delves into the current state of the dollar and euro, examining the forces at play and what the upcoming central bank announcements might mean for global finance. Understanding the Pivotal Fed Decision Impact The Federal Reserve, often simply called ‘the Fed,’ stands as the central bank of the United States, wielding immense power over global financial markets. Its mandate includes fostering maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The decisions made by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), particularly concerning the federal funds rate, resonate far beyond U.S. borders, directly influencing the US Dollar Strength and, by extension, the entire global economy. So, why is this particular Fed decision so pivotal? In an environment grappling with persistent inflation and fluctuating economic growth, the Fed’s stance on monetary policy becomes a critical determinant of market direction. A hawkish stance (implying higher interest rates) typically strengthens the dollar as it makes dollar-denominated assets more attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns. Conversely, a dovish pivot (suggesting lower rates or a pause in hikes) can weaken the dollar. The market’s anticipation of this decision, and any subtle shifts in the Fed’s language or ‘dot plot’ projections, can trigger significant currency movements even before the official announcement. Historically, moments leading up to Fed decisions are characterized by heightened volatility. Traders and investors meticulously analyze every piece of economic data – from inflation figures like the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) to employment reports suchances as Non-Farm Payrolls and GDP growth – trying to predict the Fed’s next move. A decision to pause rate hikes, or even hint at future cuts, could signal a shift in the Interest Rate Outlook , potentially easing financial conditions and impacting everything from bond yields to equity valuations and, crucially, currency valuations. Deconstructing the US Dollar Strength Conundrum The US Dollar Strength has been a defining feature of global finance for much of the past year, driven by aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve aimed at taming inflation. However, recent economic data and evolving market expectations have started to chip away at this dominance, causing the dollar to slip slightly against a basket of major currencies. What factors are contributing to this conundrum? Cooling Inflation Signals: While inflation remains elevated, recent reports have shown signs of cooling, leading some market participants to believe that the Fed might be nearing the end of its tightening cycle. If inflation is indeed trending downwards, the urgency for further aggressive rate hikes diminishes, reducing the dollar’s appeal. Revised Rate Hike Expectations: Markets are constantly repricing the probability of future rate hikes. As economic indicators suggest a potential slowdown, or if other central banks become more hawkish, the relative advantage of holding dollars might lessen. Traders are now contemplating how many more hikes, if any, the Fed has left in its arsenal. Economic Data Performance: Mixed economic data from the U.S. has also played a role. While some sectors remain resilient, others show signs of softening, raising concerns about the potential for a recession. A weaker economic outlook can temper expectations for continued dollar strength, as it implies less robust investment opportunities. Yield Differentials: The attractiveness of a currency is heavily influenced by the interest rate it offers compared to others. As other major central banks, like the European Central Bank (ECB) or the Bank of England (BoE), continue to raise their rates, the yield differential that previously favored the dollar begins to narrow, reducing its relative appeal. This dynamic creates a complex environment for traders. While the dollar retains its status as a safe-haven asset during times of global uncertainty, its recent ‘slip’ suggests that the market is beginning to price in a more nuanced Interest Rate Outlook , potentially signaling a less aggressive Fed going forward. This shift is keenly watched by investors across all asset classes, including those in the volatile cryptocurrency market, as a weaker dollar can sometimes correlate with stron",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/forex-dollar-fed-decision/,FIAT|MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC,Forex News|Euro|FED|Forex|interest rates|US Dollar,BTC,"Forex Market Alert: Dollar’s Vulnerable Position Ahead of Crucial Fed Decision.

In a separate case, Vincent Mazzotta Jr. pleaded guilty to running a $13 million crypto Ponzi scheme involving fake AI trading bots and a fictitious government agency. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years. Samourai Executives Face 25 Years Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill are preparing to plead guilty to criminal charges related to their involvement in the crypto mixing protocol. In filings that were made Tuesday in a New York federal court, both Rodriguez and Hill indicated their intent to change their earlier not guilty pleas. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday morning before Judge Denise Cote. Change of plea (Source: CourtListener ) They were initially charged in April of 2024, and now face allegations of running an unlicensed money-transmitting business that facilitated more than $2 billion in unlawful transactions, some allegedly tied to dark web platforms like Silk Road. Rodriguez, the company’s CEO, and Hill, its CTO, were accused of conspiracy to commit money laundering. This charge could result in a 20-year prison sentence. Alongside that, the unlicensed money transmission charge carries an additional five-year sentence, putting the pair at risk of a maximum 25 years behind bars. Samourai Wallet website (Source: US Attorneys Office ) Their decision to plead guilty was made months after attempts to have the case dismissed. In April, the defense pointed to a Department of Justice memo suggesting that unwitting violations related to crypto mixers would not be prosecuted. Later, they accused federal prosecutors of withholding guidance that Samourai did not require a money-transmitting license, but these efforts failed to sway the court. Samourai Wallet functioned like other crypto mixers, by blending funds from different users to obscure their origins and enhance privacy. The timing of the guilty pleas coincides with growing scrutiny on crypto privacy tools, especially as Roman Storm, co-creator of Tornado Cash, faces trial for similar charges. Storm''s case has become a focal point, and advocates warn that a conviction could set a very dangerous precedent against the development and use of open-source privacy technologies. Storm faces up to 45 years in prison if convicted on all counts. Ponzi Player Admits Guilt Vincent Anthony Mazzotta Jr, a central figure in a $13 million crypto Ponzi scheme that falsely touted the use of artificial intelligence-powered trading bots and even created a fake government agency, also recently pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy to obstruct justice. The US Department of Justice announced the plea on Monday, and shared that Mazzotta admitted to defrauding investors through bogus investment firms that promised high returns using AI-based trading strategies. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, though sentencing has not yet been determined. Press release (Source: DOJ ) The scheme operated through companies like Mind Capital and Cloud9Capital, and Mazzotta played a key role in orchestrating the fraud and then attempting to cover it up. As part of the ruse, Mazzotta co-created a fictitious federal entity, the “Federal Crypto Reserve,” which posed as a US government agency investigating the very firms that stole investors’ funds. Victims were misled into paying thousands of dollars to the fake agency in hopes of recovering their investments. Mazzotta was first charged in a 2023 superseding indictment in connection with a larger case involving his alleged co-conspirator David Saffron, He pleaded not guilty and is set to face trial on Sept. 16. Another person tied to the operation, David Kagel , previously pleaded guilty and received five years’ probation along with an order to pay more than $13.9 million in restitution. The Justice Department’s investigation found that from 2017 to 2023, Mazzotta and his associates laundered investor funds through crypto mixers before spending the proceeds on a lavish lifestyle, including private jet flights, luxury accommodations, mansions, personal chefs, and private security. They also used a range of fake entities—like Circle Society, Bitcoin Wealth Management, and Omicron Trust—to lend credibility to the scam. Authorities revealed that Mazzotta operated under several aliases, including Anthony, Delta Prime, and Director Vinchenzo, while Saffron used names like David Gilbert, The Blue Wizard, and Bitcoin Yoda. Mazzotta also allegedly helped destroy evidence at Saffron’s apartment after the latter’s indictment in June of 2022, including smashing an iPad and falsifying documents to hide his involvement.

That sharp drop has traders debating whether to hunker down or scoop up XRP near the $2.60 mark. Rally Driven By Big Bets XRP’s surge from $2.17 on July 1 to $3.66 by July 18 was powered by a surge in open interest that peaked at $11.2 billion in dollar terms.

Futures Traders Hold Steady Annualized futures premiums for monthly XRP contracts have stayed in a 6% to 8% range. That suggests traders aren’t panicking even after the price dipped below $3.

2025-07-30 09:00:12+00:00,Ethereum Adoption: Revolutionary Move as Fundamental Global Secures $200M for ETH Treasury,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Adoption: Revolutionary Move as Fundamental Global Secures $200M for ETH Treasury In a groundbreaking move that could redefine corporate treasury management, Fundamental Global, a Nasdaq-listed company, has made headlines with its substantial commitment to digital assets. The company recently announced it has raised an impressive $200 million through a private placement, earmarking these funds specifically for the purchase of Ethereum (ETH) as its primary treasury reserve asset. This significant step marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of institutional Ethereum adoption , demonstrating a clear embrace of the digital frontier by a publicly traded entity. The strategic investors participating in this private placement include prominent names in the crypto world, such as Galaxy Digital and Kraken. This collaboration not only injects substantial capital but also brings invaluable expertise. Galaxy Digital, a leading financial services and investment management firm in the digital asset sector, is set to play a crucial role, overseeing the treasury management and providing essential advisory and infrastructure support. This partnership underscores a growing trend where traditional financial structures are increasingly integrating with the innovative capabilities of the blockchain ecosystem. Why is Fundamental Global Leading the Way in Ethereum Adoption ? Fundamental Global’s decision to pivot towards Ethereum as a treasury reserve asset is not merely a speculative bet; it’s a calculated strategic move that reflects a deeper understanding of the evolving global financial landscape. But why Ethereum, specifically, and why now? Diversification and Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and inflationary concerns, companies are actively seeking alternative assets to preserve and grow capital. Ethereum, often dubbed ‘digital oil’ due to its utility and vast ecosystem, offers a decentralized hedge against traditional currency devaluation. Technological Innovation and Utility: Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a foundational blockchain platform that powers decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and the broader Web3 movement. Its programmability offers future potential for integrated financial services and operational efficiencies that traditional assets cannot provide. Growing Ecosystem and Network Effect: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades) has significantly enhanced its scalability, security, and energy efficiency, making it an even more attractive long-term asset. Institutional Acceptance: While still nascent compared to traditional markets, the increasing involvement of major financial institutions, investment funds, and now publicly traded companies like Fundamental Global, lends significant credibility and paves the way for broader institutional Ethereum adoption . This bold move signals a forward-thinking approach, positioning Fundamental Global at the forefront of corporate innovation and potentially inspiring other companies to explore similar strategies for their own balance sheets. The Mechanics of This Groundbreaking Ethereum Adoption Strategy Understanding how Fundamental Global is executing this significant shift provides insight into the practicalities of corporate crypto integration. The $200 million was raised through a private placement, a common method for companies to raise capital directly from a select group of investors rather than through a public offering. This approach often allows for more flexibility and speed. The involvement of Galaxy Digital is particularly noteworthy. As a leader in digital asset management, Galaxy Digital will provide: Treasury Management Expertise: Navigating the complexities of digital asset storage, security, and trading requires specialized knowledge. Galaxy Digital’s experience ensures that Fundamental Global’s Ethereum holdings are managed securely and efficiently.

BitcoinWorld Ethereum Adoption: Revolutionary Move as Fundamental Global Secures $200M for ETH Treasury In a groundbreaking move that could redefine corporate treasury management, Fundamental Global, a Nasdaq-listed company, has made headlines with its substantial commitment to digital assets. The company recently announced it has raised an impressive $200 million through a private placement, earmarking these funds specifically for the purchase of Ethereum (ETH) as its primary treasury reserve asset. This significant step marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing narrative of institutional Ethereum adoption , demonstrating a clear embrace of the digital frontier by a publicly traded entity. The strategic investors participating in this private placement include prominent names in the crypto world, such as Galaxy Digital and Kraken. This collaboration not only injects substantial capital but also brings invaluable expertise. Galaxy Digital, a leading financial services and investment management firm in the digital asset sector, is set to play a crucial role, overseeing the treasury management and providing essential advisory and infrastructure support. This partnership underscores a growing trend where traditional financial structures are increasingly integrating with the innovative capabilities of the blockchain ecosystem. Why is Fundamental Global Leading the Way in Ethereum Adoption ? Fundamental Global’s decision to pivot towards Ethereum as a treasury reserve asset is not merely a speculative bet; it’s a calculated strategic move that reflects a deeper understanding of the evolving global financial landscape. But why Ethereum, specifically, and why now? Diversification and Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and inflationary concerns, companies are actively seeking alternative assets to preserve and grow capital. Ethereum, often dubbed ‘digital oil’ due to its utility and vast ecosystem, offers a decentralized hedge against traditional currency devaluation. Technological Innovation and Utility: Ethereum is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a foundational blockchain platform that powers decentralized applications (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and the broader Web3 movement. Its programmability offers future potential for integrated financial services and operational efficiencies that traditional assets cannot provide. Growing Ecosystem and Network Effect: Ethereum boasts the largest and most active developer community in the blockchain space. Its transition to Ethereum 2.0 (now known as the Merge and subsequent upgrades) has significantly enhanced its scalability, security, and energy efficiency, making it an even more attractive long-term asset. Institutional Acceptance: While still nascent compared to traditional markets, the increasing involvement of major financial institutions, investment funds, and now publicly traded companies like Fundamental Global, lends significant credibility and paves the way for broader institutional Ethereum adoption . This bold move signals a forward-thinking approach, positioning Fundamental Global at the forefront of corporate innovation and potentially inspiring other companies to explore similar strategies for their own balance sheets. The Mechanics of This Groundbreaking Ethereum Adoption Strategy Understanding how Fundamental Global is executing this significant shift provides insight into the practicalities of corporate crypto integration. The $200 million was raised through a private placement, a common method for companies to raise capital directly from a select group of investors rather than through a public offering. This approach often allows for more flexibility and speed. The involvement of Galaxy Digital is particularly noteworthy. As a leader in digital asset management, Galaxy Digital will provide: Treasury Management Expertise: Navigating the complexities of digital asset storage, security, and trading requires specialized knowledge. Galaxy Digital’s experience ensures that Fundamental Global’s Ethereum holdings are managed securely and efficiently. Advisory Support: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Galaxy Digital’s advisory services will help Fundamental Global stay compliant and make informed decisions regarding their digital asset strategy. Infrastructure Support: This includes setting up secure custody solutions, trading platforms, and other technological frameworks necessary for managing a significant crypto treasury.

2025-07-30 09:10:10+00:00,Bitcoin’s Crucial Shift: Unlocking Potential for a New All-Time High,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Crucial Shift: Unlocking Potential for a New All-Time High The world of cryptocurrency is a dynamic arena, constantly buzzing with developments that can reshape market landscapes. At the heart of this excitement lies Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets. Recent on-chain data suggests a fascinating and potentially monumental shift occurring within the Bitcoin ecosystem: long-term holders are beginning to transfer their holdings to new market participants. This isn’t just a trivial movement; it’s a pattern that has historically preceded significant price surges, hinting at the possibility of a new Bitcoin ATH (All-Time High). Decoding the LTH/STH Supply Ratio: A Key to Predicting the Next Bitcoin ATH Understanding the internal mechanics of Bitcoin’s supply can provide invaluable insights into its future price trajectory. One of the most telling metrics in this regard is the Long-Term Holder to Short-Term Holder (LTH/STH) Supply Ratio. This ratio, meticulously tracked by on-chain analytics firms like Glassnode, offers a window into the distribution of Bitcoin between seasoned investors and newer entrants. What exactly does this ratio tell us? Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are Bitcoin investors who have held their coins for more than 155 days. They are typically considered the ‘strong hands’ of the market, less likely to sell due to short-term price fluctuations. Their accumulation phases often signal market bottoms. Short-Term Holders (STHs): These are newer investors who have held their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. They are often more sensitive to price movements and are more likely to buy during rallies and sell during dips. The Ratio’s Significance: A declining LTH/STH Supply Ratio means that a greater proportion of Bitcoin supply is moving from long-term holders to short-term holders. Glassnode recently reported an 11% drop in this ratio over the past 30 days, a clear indication of this supply shift. This decline suggests that long-term holders, who bought Bitcoin at lower prices, are now realizing profits by selling to new participants entering the market. This ‘supply redistribution’ is a crucial phase that has historically paved the way for a new Bitcoin ATH , as fresh capital injects renewed momentum into the market. Why Are Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Starting to Sell? The decision by long-term holders to sell their meticulously accumulated Bitcoin isn’t arbitrary; it’s a strategic move often rooted in market cycles and profit realization. After enduring bear markets and patiently holding through volatility, these seasoned investors see current market conditions as opportune moments to take profits. Several factors contribute to this behavior: Profit Realization: Many LTHs acquired Bitcoin during previous bear markets or consolidation phases. As prices climb towards or surpass previous peaks, selling allows them to lock in substantial gains, potentially re-investing later or diversifying their portfolios. Anticipation of Peak Distribution: Experienced investors understand that market cycles involve phases of accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. The current shift indicates a move into a distribution phase where supply is transferred to new buyers before a potential market peak. Market Sentiment and Euphoria: As Bitcoin gains traction and positive news cycles emerge, retail interest surges. LTHs often capitalize on this growing demand and euphoria, knowing that new money entering the market can absorb their sell orders without significant price drops. This systematic selling by long-term holders is not necessarily a bearish signal. Instead, it’s a natural and healthy part of a bull market cycle, necessary to provide liquidity for the influx of new demand that often precedes a significant price milestone like a new Bitcoin ATH . The Role of New Entrants in Driving Bitcoin’s Ascent While long-term holders are shedding some of their holdings, the absorption of this supply by new entrants is equally critical. These fresh participants, often driven by fear of missing out (FOMO) or a newfound conviction in Bitcoin’s potential, are the fuel for the next leg of the rally. Their increased demand is what ultimately propels the price towards new highs. Who are these new entrants, and what drives them? Retail Investors: Everyday individuals who are increasingly aware of Bitcoin’s performance and potential as a hedge against inflation or a store of value. Easy access through user-friendly exchanges makes entry simple. Institutional Inflows: Large financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign wealth funds are increasingly allocating capital to Bitcoin. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, for example, have opened new avenues for traditional investors to gain exposure, leading to significant capital inflows.

2025-07-30 09:15:00+00:00,Billionaire Ray Dalio Says 15% of Portfolio in Gold or Bitcoin (BTC) Necessary for Upcoming Money Devaluation Phase,"Billionaire Ray Dalio says investment portfolios should hold a certain percentage of Bitcoin ( BTC ) or gold as a hedge against the devaluation of the US dollar. In a new interview with Master Investor podcast host Wilfred Frost, the co-chief investment officer of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates says that a proper diversification of an investment portfolio should include 15% of either gold or Bitcoin as US debt rises and geopolitical tensions increase. “My own approach is, in my share of my portfolio, I have gold and I have some Bitcoin, but not much… I’m not going to describe my own exactly, but I’ll say the following: if you were neutral on everything, in other words, you didn’t have a point of view, and you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin. I’m strongly preferring gold to Bitcoin. But that’s up to you.” The risk-reward ratio, also known as the risk-return ratio, is used by investors to determine the potential gain for every dollar risked on an investment. Dalio, who has warned that a 1970s-style period of stagflation may be coming, when there’s high inflation, high unemployment and low economic growth, says Bitcoin or gold may be an effective store of value when the US dollar loses value against other currencies, such as through money printing. “The issue is the devaluation of money… If you have that issue and times when it occurred, which was in times of excess debt and geopolitical problems – just go back and study history, study the British pound, study the Dutch guilder, study this – you would find that in all such periods, also like the Seventies, [gold’s] an effective diversifier. So if you had no view, you would have about 15% in that portfolio as a hedge against the other.

The token is consolidating in a bullish pennant above rising lows after last week’s $3.66 breakout. A decisive move above $3.66 could trigger a powerful 63% surge toward $5.96. Whales opening $25 million in longs signals heavy bets on XRP’s upside. Such large positions typically reflect strong confidence in imminent price growth driven by catalysts like regulatory clarity, adoption news, or bullish technical setups. Therefore, these bullish bets might enhance XRP’s chances of jumping to the $5.96 zone due to heightened demand, according to Irma Analytics. Recent blockchain data shows XRP whales accumulating at fire‑sale prices. Approximately 310 million tokens worth $980 million were scooped up during a dip on July 27, raising whale holdings from 23.55 billion to 23.86 billion XRP. At the same time, exchange outflows skyrocketed, suggesting people are moving XRP off platforms into long‑term custody. Regulatory Catalysts: White House Crypto Report The motivation behind the recent whale activity is clear that the White House is set to release its first comprehensive crypto policy report today, replacing prior rules and clarifying roles for agencies, such as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The 180‑day report, mandated under a March 2025 executive order, could formalize the U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile and confirm whether XRP is officially included alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in federal holdings. That would mark a major shift in the token’s regulatory status. This development comes days after Ripple secured a U.S. patent for trust‑based instant cross‑border payments, a breakthrough that bypasses full network confirmations to dramatically speed transactions. Conclusion It is evident that XRP whales are not hedging or cashing out because they’re doubling down.

2025-07-30 09:20:58+00:00,BlackRock bought 4x more of this crypto than Bitcoin last week,"BlackRock is ramping up its Ethereum exposure at a pace that far outstrips its Bitcoin allocation. The world’s largest asset manager purchased more than $1.2 billion worth of Ethereum ( ETH ) between July 22 and July 28, compared to just $267 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the same period, according to on‑chain data from Arkham . The data shows multiple large‑block transfers of 10,000 ETH each (approximately $36–37 million) from Coinbase Prime hot wallets to BlackRock‑controlled wallets, alongside several smaller inflows, including a single 177,500 ETH transaction worth $655.9 million. https://twitter.com/arkham/status/1950304519268815214 Ethereum price performance At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,812.42, up 3.14% over the past week, while Bitcoin trades at $118,356.67, down 0.11% over the same period. The scale of these inflows adds weight to the narrative that Ethereum is emerging as a preferred institutional play.

BlackRock is ramping up its Ethereum exposure at a pace that far outstrips its Bitcoin allocation. The world’s largest asset manager purchased more than $1.2 billion worth of Ethereum ( ETH ) between July 22 and July 28, compared to just $267 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) over the same period, according to on‑chain data from Arkham . The data shows multiple large‑block transfers of 10,000 ETH each (approximately $36–37 million) from Coinbase Prime hot wallets to BlackRock‑controlled wallets, alongside several smaller inflows, including a single 177,500 ETH transaction worth $655.9 million. https://twitter.com/arkham/status/1950304519268815214 Ethereum price performance At the time of writing, Ethereum trades at $3,812.42, up 3.14% over the past week, while Bitcoin trades at $118,356.67, down 0.11% over the same period. The scale of these inflows adds weight to the narrative that Ethereum is emerging as a preferred institutional play.

2025-07-30 09:25:10+00:00,Bitcoin Whale Awakens: Shocking 50 BTC Transfer After 14.5 Years of Dormancy,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Awakens: Shocking 50 BTC Transfer After 14.5 Years of Dormancy Imagine a treasure chest, hidden away and untouched for nearly a decade and a half, suddenly creaking open. In the fascinating world of cryptocurrency, something remarkably similar just happened. A long-dormant Bitcoin whale , an address holding a substantial amount of BTC, has stirred from its slumber after an astonishing 14.5 years, making a significant transfer that has sent ripples across the crypto community. This unexpected move raises compelling questions about the intentions behind such a long-awaited awakening and its potential implications for the broader market. The Shocking Awakening of a Bitcoin Whale: What Exactly Happened? Just recently, the crypto sphere buzzed with news of an extraordinary on-chain event. An address, identified by on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X (formerly Twitter), which had been dormant for an astounding 14.5 years, suddenly sprang to life. This particular address was no small fish; it held a staggering 3,963 BTC. What caught everyone’s attention was the transfer of 50 BTC, valued at approximately $5.91 million at the time of the move, to a new address beginning with ‘bc1q8c’. This seemingly simple transaction is anything but, given the history and the sheer volume of Bitcoin involved. For context, 14.5 years ago, Bitcoin was in its infancy, a niche digital experiment known only to a handful of tech enthusiasts. The value of 50 BTC then would have been negligible, perhaps just a few dollars. Today, it represents a multi-million dollar sum. The ‘bc1q8c’ prefix indicates a SegWit (bech32) address, a newer and more efficient address format, suggesting that whoever is behind this Bitcoin whale address is now interacting with modern Bitcoin infrastructure. This detail alone sparks further speculation: is this the original owner, someone who has only now regained access, or perhaps a new entity? The mystery deepens with every layer of on-chain data we peel back. Why Does a Bitcoin Whale Awakening Command Attention? When a Bitcoin whale , especially one that has been dormant for such an extended period, makes a move, it’s not just another transaction; it’s a headline event. But why is this so significant? Here are a few key reasons: Scarcity and Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins. When large amounts of BTC sit dormant for years, they are effectively removed from the circulating supply. An awakening suggests these coins might re-enter the market, potentially impacting supply-demand dynamics. Market Sentiment: Whale movements can be perceived as indicators of market sentiment. A large transfer could signal an impending sell-off, creating fear (FUD), or it could be a reallocation, suggesting strategic positioning. The psychological impact on retail investors can be considerable. Historical Context and Mystery: Wallets from Bitcoin’s early days are often associated with its mysterious creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, or early adopters. The awakening of such a wallet fuels speculation and adds a layer of intrigue to the market narrative. Was the owner truly dormant, or simply biding their time? On-Chain Insights: These movements provide valuable data for on-chain analysts. By tracking such transfers, analysts can gain insights into long-term holding patterns, potential distribution events, and the overall health of the network. The 14.5-year dormancy period places this wallet firmly in the category of ‘early adopter’ or ‘Satoshi-era’ addresses, making its recent activity all the more compelling for observers and investors alike. Decoding Dormant Wallets: Insights from On-Chain Analysis Understanding the behavior of a Bitcoin whale requires delving into the fascinating world of on-chain analysis. This discipline involves examining publicly available data on the blockchain to infer market trends and participant behavior. For dormant wallets, the analysis often focuses on: Age of UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs): This tells analysts how long the coins in a specific address have remained untouched. A high age indicates long-term holding. Transaction Patterns: Is it a single large transfer or multiple smaller ones? Is it moving to an exchange, a new personal wallet, or a DeFi protocol? The destination can reveal intent. Associated Addresses: Are other dormant wallets waking up simultaneously? This could indicate a coordinated move by a single entity or group. When a wallet wakes up after such a long period, there are several common hypotheses: Lost Keys Found: The owner might have finally recovered access to their private keys after years of searching or through a technological breakthrough. Strategic Reallocation: The owner, after a long period of HODLing, might be moving funds to a more secure or liquid address, or preparing for a new investment. Estate Planning/Inheritance: In some cases, the original owner may have passed away, and their heirs are now accessing the fu",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-awakens-transfer/,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,Crypto News|BITCOIN|crypto whale|dormant wallet|market impact|on-chain analysis,BTC,"Bitcoin Whale Awakens: Shocking 50 BTC Transfer After 14.5 Years of Dormancy.

Here Are the Details…","Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced significant pullbacks following the new ATH above $123,000 seen in July. While Bitcoin, which has been in a cooling period after the last ATH, continues to trade in a narrow range, it is stated that Bitcoin''s implied volatility index (BVIV) has fallen to its lowest level since September 2023. Experts stated that this situation indicates a bullish potential in Bitcoin, citing previous data. At this point, experts pointed out that the BVIV index last reached its lowest level in September 2023, and reported that on this date, BTC started at approximately $ 26,000 and then doubled in price, increasing by almost 50%. According to the data, the 30-day implied volatility index (BVIV) for BTC has fallen to 40.84, falling below the threshold of 45. Historically, this zone has signaled periods of accumulation or local bottoms, followed by strong upward movements. Moreover, since the second half of 2022, when the BVIV remained below the 45 level at the weekly close, BTC prices have generally shown an upward trend. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could once again be preparing the ground for another upward breakout, according to the BVIV indicator. Finally, Glassnode reported that even short-term investors (STH) in the market are holding their Bitcoin, not selling it. The Market Value/Realized Value (MVRV) ratio for short-term investors currently stands at 1.19, below the cycle peak of 1.33 recorded in November 2024.

Price Analysis and Insights,"Bitcoin (BTC) is still flirting with the top of a bull flag and trend suggests that a breakout could come as soon as this week. If the breakout occurs, where could Bitcoin head to next? A message to hold strong Michael Saylor, Chairman of Strategy, announced another huge Bitcoin purchase for his company on Tuesday. This time, it was 21,021 BTC for a price of $2.46 billion. Before announcing the purchase, Saylor put out an X post with an image of himself dressed as a cowboy on a horse. The statement with the image reads: “The cowards never started, and the weak died along the way.” This quote is popularly attributed to a historic migration route in the 19th century, called the Oregon Trail. It was also used in more recent history by the Nike founder Phil Knight in his book Shoe Dog. Here it was employed to galvanize the Nike team during a particularly challenging time. By utilising this gritty message from another era, Saylor is perhaps attempting to get the average retail investor to gird their loins and hang in there as far as Bitcoin is concerned. He is potentially saying that the “cowards” are those who can’t bring themselves to jump across from the fiat/banking world and into the transactional freedom of Bitcoin. He is also perhaps labelling the “weak” as those who couldn’t hang on to their Bitcoin and who sold on any of the market downturns. On the other hand, Saylor portrays himself as a dogged cowboy who endures until the end of the trail, made stronger by the experience and gifted by the rewards of rich land. While some might sneer and say that this just an effort at self-agrandizement, and although there is very little in common with a Bitcoin investor and a hard-bitten trail blazer in an extremely unforgiving environment, the message is clear - hold on through the volatile ups and downs of the market, and your reward could be great. $BTC breakout in one to three days Source: TradingView The $BTC chart pattern is continuing to evolve. While the price bounces around inside the bull flag, a trend line that stretches from price action inside the previous bull flag is perhaps corralling the price into a narrowing space. If the price continues to respect this trendline, a breakout should come within the next one to three days. In this case, it might not be the breakout of the bull flag, as the price could drop through the trendline and continue to go sideways. Measured move to $128,000 Source: TradingView The daily chart for $BTC shows the measured move of the breakout should this come to pass. It would take the price up to just above $128,000, potentially opening the route to $150,000 and beyond. However, if this trendline does not hold up, and the price falls back down to the bottom trendline of the bull flag, it could retest the 50-day SMA (blue line) and then be in prime position for an even stronger impulse to the upside. The Stochastic RSI on the daily time frame has the indicator lines bouncing along the bottom, ready to angle up and signal an increase in upside price momentum for the breakout. Concerns for the longer term momentum indicators? Source: TradingView With the weekly Stochastic RSI indicators now showing a cross-down from the top, some might be worrying that this could be signalling the end of this long period of upside price action. Also, with the 2-week Stochastic RSI indicators starting to get near the top, even more concern might be registering. However, one only has to look left to see that in 2023 the indicators stayed at the top for nearly six months, while at the end of 2023 and into 2024, the indicators were at the top for around three months. All one needs to know is that at least for the time being, the trend is still up, and there is likely to be more price appreciation over these next three to four months.

2025-07-30 09:40:10+00:00,Altcoin Season: Sygnum Predicts Explosive Opportunities Ahead,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Sygnum Predicts Explosive Opportunities Ahead Are you ready for what could be the next major shift in the cryptocurrency market? Swiss crypto bank Sygnum Bank has just released its Q3 2025 Investment Outlook, and their insights suggest something many crypto enthusiasts have been eagerly anticipating: the long-awaited altcoin season . This isn’t just wishful thinking; Sygnum’s report points to several concrete factors that could ignite a significant rally for alternative cryptocurrencies, moving beyond Bitcoin’s recent dominance. Let’s dive into the details and explore what could be driving this potential market transformation. What’s Fueling the Anticipated Altcoin Season? Sygnum Bank’s optimistic outlook for an impending altcoin season is built on a foundation of three key pillars: improved regulatory clarity, growing liquidity across the crypto ecosystem, and a noticeable surge in on-chain activity. These elements are creating a fertile ground for altcoins to thrive, potentially leading to a period where they outperform Bitcoin. Improved Regulatory Clarity One of the most significant hurdles for mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the crypto space has always been regulatory uncertainty. However, Sygnum’s report highlights a positive shift. As governments and financial bodies worldwide work towards clearer guidelines for digital assets, the environment becomes more predictable and secure for investors. This clarity encourages more capital to flow into the market, not just into established assets like Bitcoin, but also into a broader range of altcoins that can now operate with greater confidence. This reduction in regulatory risk makes the entire market, especially the altcoin sector, more appealing to both retail and institutional participants. Growing Liquidity and Institutional Inflows The crypto market is seeing an unprecedented influx of capital, signaling robust growth in liquidity. A prime example is the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have collectively topped an astounding $160 billion in assets. While these ETFs primarily focus on Bitcoin, their very existence and success pave the way for similar products for other major cryptocurrencies, such as Ethereum. Indeed, Ethereum has already witnessed record ETF inflows, demonstrating a broadening institutional appetite beyond just Bitcoin. This increasing liquidity means there’s more capital available to be deployed across various digital assets, setting the stage for a potential altcoin season where funds rotate into promising projects. Rising On-Chain Activity Beyond price movements, the underlying activity on blockchain networks provides a crucial indicator of health and adoption. Sygnum’s report notes a significant uptick in on-chain engagement. For instance, following the Pectra upgrade, a remarkable 30% of Ethereum’s liquid supply is now staked. This indicates strong conviction among holders and a reduced selling pressure, as assets are locked up to secure the network and earn rewards. Furthermore, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have achieved a record 30% market share, processing $530 billion in volumes. This shift from centralized exchanges to DEXs underscores a growing preference for decentralized trading, often involving a wide array of altcoins. Similarly, decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocols have seen their total value locked (TVL) soar past $70 billion, showcasing a vibrant ecosystem of financial applications built on blockchain technology. These metrics collectively suggest a healthy, active, and growing ecosystem, ripe for an altcoin season . Why Does Bitcoin Dominance Matter for an Altcoin Season? The concept of ‘Bitcoin dominance’ is crucial when discussing an altcoin season . Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market capitalization as a percentage of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. When Bitcoin dominance is high, it typically means capital is primarily concentrated in BTC. However, Sygnum’s report, as noted by Cointelegraph, reveals that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance has fallen more than 6% in a single month. This decline is a key signal that capital is beginning to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Historically, a decreasing Bitcoin dominance often precedes or accompanies an altcoin season . It suggests that investors, having secured profits or gained confidence from Bitcoin’s performance, are now seeking higher returns by investing in altcoins. These alternative cryptocurrencies, especially those with smaller market caps, often have greater potential for explosive growth during such periods. The rotation of capital indicates a maturing market where investors are increasingly comfortable exploring the broader crypto landscape beyond just the flagship digital asset. Beyond the Hype: Real-World Use Cases and DeFi’s Role in Altcoin Season One of the most compelling aspects highlighted by Sygnum is that capital is increasingly rotating into projects with tangible",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-sygnum-predicts/,ALTCOIN|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS,Crypto News|altcoin season|Crypto Market|DeFi.|ETHEREUM|Sygnum Bank,BTC,"Altcoin Season: Sygnum Predicts Explosive Opportunities Ahead.

However, Sygnum’s report, as noted by Cointelegraph, reveals that Bitcoin (BTC) dominance has fallen more than 6% in a single month. This decline is a key signal that capital is beginning to rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Historically, a decreasing Bitcoin dominance often precedes or accompanies an altcoin season . It suggests that investors, having secured profits or gained confidence from Bitcoin’s performance, are now seeking higher returns by investing in altcoins. These alternative cryptocurrencies, especially those with smaller market caps, often have greater potential for explosive growth during such periods. The rotation of capital indicates a maturing market where investors are increasingly comfortable exploring the broader crypto landscape beyond just the flagship digital asset. Beyond the Hype: Real-World Use Cases and DeFi’s Role in Altcoin Season One of the most compelling aspects highlighted by Sygnum is that capital is increasingly rotating into projects with tangible"

MARA Holdings delivered a standout second quarter, with revenue rising 64% year-over-year to $238 million—beating analyst estimates of $223.7 million. This also marked a notable improvement from its Q1 revenue of $214 million. The company’s net income saw a dramatic jump, surging to $808 million compared to a net loss of nearly $200 million during the same period last year. How Did MARA Revenue Soar? The sharp rise in profit was primarily attributed to an unrealized $1.2 billion gain from Bitcoin’s appreciation. Over the three-month period ending June 30, Bitcoin rose 31%, substantially boosting MARA’s balance sheet value. Following the earnings announcement, MARA’s stock jumped as much as 7.5% in after-hours trading to a high of $17.82 before settling at $17.22. Despite closing regular trading hours on Tuesday 3.2% lower at $16.61, MARA shares have gained 58% since mid-April, though they’ve remained largely range-bound over the past several months.

As of the end of Q2, the company held 49,951 BTC—up 170% year-over-year—valued at approximately $5.3 billion. Post-quarter, this figure has crossed the 50,000 BTC mark, positioning MARA as the second-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin . The company trails only Strategy, which holds 607,770 BTC worth around $71 billion. Operationally, MARA mined 2,358 BTC in Q2, a 3% increase from the previous quarter. Its energized hashrate rose to 57.4 exahashes per second (EH/s), up from 54.3 EH/s in Q1. The company aims to reach 75 EH/s by the end of the year.

2025-07-30 09:45:00+00:00,Avalanche price prediction 2025-2031: Time to buy AVAX?,"Key takeaways: Our Avalanche price prediction anticipates a high of $33.36 in 2025. In 2027, it will range between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, it will range between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings in 2024. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits in 2025. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $23.73 Market cap $10.02B Trading volume $638.82M Circulating supply 422.27M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $25.25 24-hour low $23.94 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 13.45% 50-day SMA $20.58 200-day SMA $22.52 Sentiment Bullish Green days 18/30 (60%) Fear and Greed Index 74 (Greed) Avalanche price analysis: AVAX fails to break above $27 As of July 30, AVAX’s price dropped by 4.85% in 24 hours as it corrected from a 30-day bull run. AVAX failed to break above $27 breakout, triggering profit-taking and short setups. AVAX mirrored sector weakness. XRP, SOL, and ADA fell 3-5% as traders reduced leveraged positions. Friday’s U.S. jobs data and August 1 tariff deadlines amplified caution. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView Last month, AVAX attempted a recovery, which saw it rise from a low of $19.09 to a high of $27.38. It faced strong resistance at its 3-day macro supply zone ($27.00-$27.38), a level that triggered 3 rejections since March 2025. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is rising. Notably, the histograms (-0.12) show negative momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s correction after facing rejection at $27.

Technical analysis suggests that Avalanche is bullish, but the overextension of the technicals has forced a market correction. Fed rate decision anxiety (July 30-31) drove risk-off moves in altcoins, contributing to AVAX’s drop. Recent news Filecoin Foundation and Avalanche have partnered to launch a new cross-chain data bridge. The bridge will allow developers to build on Avalanche’s C-Chain to store data on Filecoin’s decentralized network. Why is AVAX down? AVAX is correcting from its highest last year; the crypto market capitalization is also bearish. The drop in AVAX value could be attributed to the general market sentiment. Will AVAX reach $50?

2025-07-30 09:52:11+00:00,Expert Says It’s XRP’s Turn for a Massive Bull Run. Here’s why,"Financial expert and creator of Crypto Crusaders, Levi Rietveld, has once again weighed in on the ongoing debate surrounding the utility of Bitcoin in real-world payments, particularly for businesses and institutions, compared to XRP. In a recent post on X, Rietveld stated, “Bitcoin had its run… now it’s XRP’s turn!!” He also captioned a short video in which he directly addressed remarks made by Strategy Executive Chairman, Michael Saylor, about the future adoption of Bitcoin as a global standard. In the video, Rietveld focused on a statement from Saylor in which the prominent Bitcoin maximalist claimed, “You’re using Bitcoin right now. If you keep it, you’ll be insanely rich. But I think ultimately, base network is going to have 10 to 100,000 big financial institutions. Every company, every family owner should adopt the Bitcoin standard.” According to Saylor, Bitcoin will serve as the fundamental base layer for a global financial infrastructure. Rietveld responded by highlighting the operational limitations of Bitcoin’s base layer, which he noted processes a transaction roughly every fifteen minutes. He argued that the practical challenges tied to Bitcoin’s throughput prevent it from serving as an efficient layer-one financial system for the kinds of enterprises Saylor referenced. Rietveld pointed out that most companies are currently unwilling to adopt Bitcoin due to the technical and financial requirements involved in running the Lightning Network, which is Bitcoin’s layer-two scaling solution. BITCOIN HAD ITS RUN .. NOW IT''S #XRP ''s TURN!! pic.twitter.com/UrKiln1bOx — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) July 28, 2025 Critique of the Lightning Network’s Requirements Rietveld explained that to utilize the Lightning Network effectively, businesses would need to maintain substantial reserves of Bitcoin to manage liquidity for transactions. Given the current market price of Bitcoin, he asserted that this prerequisite is cost-prohibitive for small and medium-sized enterprises. He argued that this requirement poses a significant barrier to broader adoption among businesses that operate on tight margins or have limited exposure to digital assets. He further emphasized that allocating capital toward holding a volatile and expensive asset, solely to facilitate payments, is not a viable strategy for most organizations. Rietveld maintained that this undermines the argument that Bitcoin can realistically serve as a global standard for everyday commerce. Comparison With XRP’s Cost and Efficiency In contrast, Rietveld presented XRP as a more feasible option for real-world adoption . He asserted that XRP offers significantly faster transaction speeds and much lower fees without requiring businesses to tie up substantial capital. According to Rietveld, the ease of integration and the low acquisition costs make XRP a more suitable candidate for payments, particularly in retail and enterprise contexts. He noted that XRP can settle transactions in seconds and at a fraction of a penny, which he argued makes it more compatible with the demands of both high-volume and micro-payment scenarios. Rietveld concluded that XRP avoids many of the logistical and financial issues from the Bitcoin base layer and its associated scaling solutions.

His assertion that “Bitcoin had its run” reflects a view that while Bitcoin may continue to function as a digital asset for holding value, it may not be the optimal technology for building scalable, low-cost payment networks. Rietveld’s comments come at a time when digital asset infrastructure is being evaluated by institutions looking for efficient settlement solutions. In this context, XRP remains positioned by advocates as a high-speed, low-cost protocol capable of meeting institutional-grade requirements. This XRP’s technical advantages over Bitcoin in payment have rekindled debate about which digital assets are best suited for real-world deployment.

2025-07-30 09:52:13+00:00,AML Bitcoin Founder Sentenced to 7 Years for Fraud and Money Laundering,"Rowland Marcus Andrade, founder and CEO of NAC Foundation, has been sentenced to seven years in federal prison for wire fraud and money laundering linked to the cryptocurrency project AML Bitcoin. Key Takeaways: AML Bitcoin founder Rowland Marcus Andrade received a seven-year prison sentence for wire fraud. Andrade misled investors with false claims, including a fake Panama Canal partnership. A hearing in September will determine how much restitution Andrade must pay to victims. The US Department of Justice found that Andrade and his company misled investors between 2014 and 2019 , raising nearly $10 million through false promises about the coin’s capabilities, launch timeline, and business prospects. “The defendant made one false claim after another about a sophisticated cryptocurrency offering to create the illusion of a legitimate business,” US Attorney Craig H. Missakian said. Prosecutors: Andrade Faked Panama Canal Deal to Boost AML Bitcoin Prosecutors detailed how Andrade fabricated claims, including an alleged partnership with the Panama Canal Authority, to convince investors of AML Bitcoin’s legitimacy. “He exploited numerous investors who put their trust in him, not knowing that their hard-earned money was in fact funding his lavish lifestyle,” Missakian said. Investigators revealed that Andrade laundered and spent more than $2 million of investor funds on personal expenses, such as real estate in Texas and two luxury vehicles. His prison sentence, which begins October 31, 2025, will be followed by three years of supervised release. As a result of an FBI San Francisco investigation with IRS-CI, cryptocurrency founder and CEO Rowland Marcus Andrade was sentenced today to 7 years in prison for a multi-million-dollar fraud scheme.

Rowland Marcus Andrade, founder and CEO of NAC Foundation, has been sentenced to seven years in federal prison for wire fraud and money laundering linked to the cryptocurrency project AML Bitcoin. Key Takeaways: AML Bitcoin founder Rowland Marcus Andrade received a seven-year prison sentence for wire fraud. Andrade misled investors with false claims, including a fake Panama Canal partnership. A hearing in September will determine how much restitution Andrade must pay to victims. The US Department of Justice found that Andrade and his company misled investors between 2014 and 2019 , raising nearly $10 million through false promises about the coin’s capabilities, launch timeline, and business prospects. “The defendant made one false claim after another about a sophisticated cryptocurrency offering to create the illusion of a legitimate business,” US Attorney Craig H. Missakian said. Prosecutors: Andrade Faked Panama Canal Deal to Boost AML Bitcoin Prosecutors detailed how Andrade fabricated claims, including an alleged partnership with the Panama Canal Authority, to convince investors of AML Bitcoin’s legitimacy. “He exploited numerous investors who put their trust in him, not knowing that their hard-earned money was in fact funding his lavish lifestyle,” Missakian said. Investigators revealed that Andrade laundered and spent more than $2 million of investor funds on personal expenses, such as real estate in Texas and two luxury vehicles. His prison sentence, which begins October 31, 2025, will be followed by three years of supervised release. As a result of an FBI San Francisco investigation with IRS-CI, cryptocurrency founder and CEO Rowland Marcus Andrade was sentenced today to 7 years in prison for a multi-million-dollar fraud scheme.

2025-07-30 09:58:15+00:00,AML Bitcoin founder gets 7 years for $10M crypto scam,"A 47-year-old crypto CEO has been sentenced to seven years in prison for his role in a $10 million fraud scheme that misled victims using a fake cryptocurrency called AML Bitcoin. On Tuesday, Rowland Marcus Andrade, founder and CEO of the now-defunct AML Bitcoin project, received his sentence from Chief US District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco. The court has also ordered a forfeiture hearing scheduled for September 16 to determine how much of Andrade’s assets will be returned to the victims. Federal prosecutors said Andrade ran a years-long scheme that falsely marketed AML Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency with built-in anti-money laundering technology. He told investors the coin featured advanced security features and claimed it would soon be adopted by major institutions, including the Panama Canal Authority. Investigators later found that no such technology existed, and the Panama Canal deal never materialised. What is AML Bitcoin? Andrade launched AML Bitcoin with promises that it complied with US regulatory standards and could track criminal activity, giving it an edge over other cryptocurrencies. These claims drew in millions from retail investors who believed they were backing a legitimate and innovative project. However, prosecutors said Andrade fabricated key details about the token’s capabilities and business partnerships to lure in victims. According to court documents, Andrade diverted more than $2 million in investor funds for personal use. He used the money to purchase two properties in Texas and luxury cars, while misleading patrons that the funds were being used for the development and promotion of AML Bitcoin. “The defendant made one false claim after another about a sophisticated cryptocurrency offering to create the illusion of a legitimate business,” said United States Attorney Craig H. Missakian, adding that Andrade “exploited numerous investors who put their trust in him, not knowing that their hard-earned money was in fact funding his lavish lifestyle.” Federal agents were able to trace the laundered money through multiple bank accounts tied to Andrade. Negotiating a 17-year sentence Jurors found Andrade guilty in March 2025 after a five-week trial that detailed how he misled investors and funnelled their money into personal luxuries. During sentencing, federal prosecutors urged the court to impose a 17.5-year prison term, arguing that the scale of Andrade’s deception and the financial harm to victims warranted a lengthy sentence. Andrade’s legal team, in contrast, asked for just two years in prison followed by supervised release, claiming he did not intend to cause harm and had cooperated with investigators. In the end, Chief Judge Richard Seeborg handed down a seven-year sentence followed by three years of supervised release under court-mandated conditions. Justice Department continues crackdown on crypto-related crimes The Department of Justice has ramped up enforcement actions against cryptocurrency-related fraud in recent months. Over the past week alone, the DOJ has pursued several high-profile forfeiture cases targeting digital assets lost to scams and frauds. In one case, the DOJ filed a civil complaint to recover over $7 million in crypto tied to a $97 million oil and gas investment scam. Separately, prosecutors moved to seize over 20 Bitcoin linked to a ransomware operator affiliated with a newly discovered ransomware group.

2025-07-30 10:06:13+00:00,Bitcoin’s $120K Rally in Jeopardy as Miners Flood Binance With $2B BTC,"Bitcoin’s recent attempt to reclaim the $120,000 mark is facing new headwinds after Binance witnessed one of the largest single-day miner deposit spikes in months. According to a report by CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, on July 25, miners sent over 18,000 BTC, worth more than $2 billion, to the exchange. The move coincided with a $650 million USDC withdrawal event, raising concerns over short-term liquidity pressure despite an otherwise bullish market backdrop. Miner Behavior Flips The uptick in miner deposits marks a sharp shift from their previously cautious stance. As recently as June 29, CryptoQuant data showed miners were holding onto their reserves, despite declining revenues and a slight 3.5% drop in Bitcoin’s hashrate. Analysts attributed this “HODL” behavior to strong unrealized profits and expectations of further upside. However, Bitcoin’s July rally toward $120,000, just a few grand shy of its July 14 all-time high, appears to have triggered profit-taking. Taha suggested that rising operational costs and mining difficulty may also be compelling miners to liquidate some holdings to manage expenses. He stated that such large inflows to exchanges have historically preceded periods of consolidation, as selling pressure temporarily outweighs new demand: “While long-term sentiment remains bullish, this sharp inflow and capital movement may precede a period of consolidation or a local correction.” The expert also noted that Binance had recorded its largest USDC net outflow in more than two months, with $650 million exiting the platform on the same day as the BTC inflow. This stablecoin drain suggests that some traders could be shifting funds to cold storage or alternative venues, potentially reducing immediate buy-side liquidity on the exchange. Meanwhile, Binance has taken steps to adapt to shifting liquidity conditions. It recently launched Discount Buy, a feature allowing users to purchase crypto at below-market rates, potentially incentivizing accumulation during dips. Taha suggested in his analysis that the platform is once again “becoming a focal point for short-term supply and liquidity shifts.” Market Outlook At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $117,981, down slightly by 0.7% over the past 24 hours and 0.6% over the past week, while holding an 8.8% monthly gain. The asset remains within a tight seven-day range of $115,184 to $119,568, perhaps indicating market indecision near key resistance. Despite the sell-off, Bitcoin’s long-term fundamentals remain strong. Miner reserves had been climbing since March, with addresses holding 100 to 1,000 BTC accumulating 65,000 BTC, their highest level since November 2024, per CryptoQuant. For now, traders are waiting to see if the flagship cryptocurrency can hold support above $115,000. If it does, analysts expect another attempt at breaking $120,000, potentially setting the stage for a retest of the all-time high.

Michaël van de Poppe expects a stronger move the longer BTC remains rangebound. CryptoQuant data shows Bitcoin is in a neutral phase with no trend dominance yet. On-chain signals mirror 2020 patterns, hinting at a possible bull cycle end soon. Price Holds in Narrow Band Bitcoin (BTC) was priced at $118,300 at press time, down 0.2% over the week. For several weeks now, the asset has been moving in a tight zone without direction. Traders are showing caution ahead of today’s FOMC interest rate decision. Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe described the current pattern as “extremely boring,” pointing to the lack of decision or momentum. Bitcoin has been holding between $116,800 and $119,500, with no clear move up or down. His chart shows that liquidity above and below this range has already been cleared. That often happens before a strong price move. He added that a break above $119,500 could open the way for a test of previous highs. If the price drops instead, the $110,000 to $112,000 range may become a key area to watch for buying. Extremely boring range for the past few weeks on #Bitcoin . Still no breakout, still no decision.

It currently stands at 44%. Notably, this number reflects several market signals, including selling activity from long-term holders, ETF inflows, and overall demand. A higher number means the market is heating up. A lower one suggests a quiet phase, often seen before prices rise.

While some profit-taking is beginning, it’s still at a controlled pace. Short-Term Cooling Continues Another CryptoQuant analyst, known as Crypto Dan, noted a small cooling period after a brief wave of short-term activity. They looked at the amount of Bitcoin held for just one day to one week and said the numbers showed signs of short-term heat earlier this month. Source: CryptoQuant Compared to the larger corrections seen in 2024 and early 2025, this phase appears smaller in both strength and length. The analyst also said the recent price increase was not large, which could limit how deep or long any correction might be. Crypto Dan suggested that traders may need to wait through this cooling period before seeing the next upward trend. Long-Term Wallet Activity Shows Familiar Pattern On-chain analyst Joao Wedson pointed out that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than 10,000 BTC is falling again—just like it did during the 2020–2021 bull market. During that time, the price kept rising even as large holders reduced their positions. “The same pattern is happening again,” Wedson said. He also mentioned that this may point to the final stretch of the current bull market cycle. “In my opinion, this signals that the BTC bull market has just a few weeks left.” he said This pattern is being watched closely, especially as the market continues to move within a narrow range.

While some profit-taking is beginning, it’s still at a controlled pace. Short-Term Cooling Continues Another CryptoQuant analyst, known as Crypto Dan, noted a small cooling period after a brief wave of short-term activity. They looked at the amount of Bitcoin held for just one day to one week and said the numbers showed signs of short-term heat earlier this month. Source: CryptoQuant Compared to the larger corrections seen in 2024 and early 2025, this phase appears smaller in both strength and length. The analyst also said the recent price increase was not large, which could limit how deep or long any correction might be. Crypto Dan suggested that traders may need to wait through this cooling period before seeing the next upward trend. Long-Term Wallet Activity Shows Familiar Pattern On-chain analyst Joao Wedson pointed out that the number of Bitcoin wallets holding more than 10,000 BTC is falling again—just like it did during the 2020–2021 bull market. During that time, the price kept rising even as large holders reduced their positions. “The same pattern is happening again,” Wedson said. He also mentioned that this may point to the final stretch of the current bull market cycle. “In my opinion, this signals that the BTC bull market has just a few weeks left.” he said This pattern is being watched closely, especially as the market continues to move within a narrow range.

2025-07-30 10:13:34+00:00,BITO: There Are Better Ways To Play Bitcoin (Technical Analysis),"Summary BITO''s technicals show balanced support/resistance, but a double top and weak momentum signal a potential bearish reversal. Bullish momentum is fading, with MACD, RSI, and stochastics all confirming weakening bulls and rising downside risk. BITO''s structure offers high yield but comes with higher risk and expenses compared to ARKB and IBIT peers. Given the elevated risk, high fees, and weak technicals, I find BITO unattractive for investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has regained its mojo after Trump''s election win as his administration has promised a favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. One of the ways to play Bitcoin is through the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA: BITO ), but as you can see below, the fund has diverged from the underlying asset. This is due to a unique structure in which the ETF has a monstrous dividend yield and so investors can easily reinvest if they wish to do so. In the below technical analysis, it is shown that while support and resistance are relatively balanced, bullish momentum is weak and a double top suggests the potential of a bearish reversal. Near the end of this article, it is also discussed that the ETF has higher risk and expenses than peers and so I believe that BITO is unattractive for investors looking for Bitcoin exposure. Seeking Alpha Trend Lines Are Converging Yahoo Finance For today''s technical analysis, I will first look at some key support and resistance zones for the ETF as well as some of the trends. Currently, BITO is in a longer term uptrend that began back in early April. That trend line was most recently support at the start of July. However, in the near term, a potential downtrend may have been forming since early to mid July. As these trend lines converge, it will be interesting to see which way the ETF breaks out. For support, there are three key levels that investors should keeps their eyes on. The area around 21.8 could come to the rescue soon as a major July gap up occurred there. The 20.8 level should also be significant support since that area was resistance back in March and April. Lastly, the 19.7s could also be support as a late March peak occurred there and an early May trough also occurred there. While there is significant support, resistance is also abundant. Just above 23, there may be resistance as that price level was a key obstacle for BITO in the second half of February. As you can see in the above chart, the next source of resistance is a double top pattern at about 23.5. This could be a sign that a bearish reversal is in the cards and so investors should be on the look out for further signs of technical weakness. Lastly, there may be considerable resistance in the 24.5s as well since a major February gap down occurred there. Momentum Is Weak Yahoo Finance In the above discussion, it was shown that the ETF had relatively balanced support and resistance. Now we turn to see how momentum is playing out for BITO. For the long term, the 50 day SMA broke above the 200 day SMA in early July for a golden cross. That indicated the arrival of a bullish period. However, the 50 day SMA''s trajectory has been weak and the deviation between the SMAs has failed to expand in a strong manner. Therefore it seems that long term bulls are still hesitating as clearly momentum has not been ideal. For the near term, let''s first look at the EMAs. The 9 day EMA had a bullish crossover with the 21 day EMA also in early July to show strength. After expanding, the gap between the EMAs has started to narrow and so near term bullishness is now receding. The ETF has also broken below the 9 day EMA and so there is some notable weakness in the bulls. For the MACD, a bullish crossover occurred in early July as well. The histogram was quite strong for a period but note that the past 8 bars have been red and so momentum has weakened significantly. In fact, a bearish crossover seems to be imminent to reflect near term bearishness. From the above moving averages and MACD indicator, I believe it is clear that bullish momentum is weak and near term momentum is actually at risk of turning bearish. As an aside, note that the MACD confirms the double top in BITO. At the ETF''s July peak, the indicator made a much lower high than back at the ETF''s high in May. Therefore, there is a good chance for a bearish reversal. We''ll look at more signs of confirmation a little later. Bulls Are Still In Control - For Now Yahoo Finance The ETF broke above the Bollinger Bands midline in early July to show that the bulls have taken control. BITO actually went on to break above the upper band and so perhaps the near term downtrend could be seen as an overbought pullback. In recent days, the ETF has pulled back to near the midline and so while the bulls seem to still be in control, there should definitely be some cautiousness. The RSI shows a similar story. The indicator nearly hit 70 in the first half of July to show dominant bulls but has now ",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805920-bito-there-are-better-ways-to-play-bitcoin-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET,BITO,BTC,"BITO: There Are Better Ways To Play Bitcoin (Technical Analysis).

However, BTC quickly recovered, underscoring the strength of institutional demand.

Even after subtracting the whale’s sale, net flows still show a surplus of 35,165 BTC.

Derivatives Market Signals Tension While spot is calm, Bitcoin derivatives are showing tension. Open interest in BTC perpetual futures has gone above 300,000 BTC, levels not seen since November 2024.

Glassnode reports that Ethereum’s perpetual open interest dominance has risen to nearly 40%, a level rarely seen since early 2023. This shift hints at speculative rotation away from Bitcoin, at least temporarily. With U.S. macro catalysts looming, including the FOMC rate decision, Trump’s tariff deadline on Aug. 1, and a potential White House crypto report, traders should expect sharp volatility across both BTC and ETH. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Symmetrical Triangle Forming Technically, Bitcoin is inside a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, with price coiling between lower highs and rising trendline support. This is a setup for a big breakout. BTC is currently at $118,000, just below the 50-SMA at $118,204, which is now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI is at 48, neutral but rising, so momentum is building. Price just bounced off the ascending support at $117,025 and is making higher lows, which is bullish accumulation. Several small candles, including Dojis and spinning tops, are showing market indecision, which is common before a breakout. Key levels to watch: Resistance: $120,283 (top of triangle) Breakout targets: $122,845 and $125,408 Support: $117,025 then $114,532 and $111,799 If BTC breaks above $120,283 with volume and RSI strength, we should see momentum to $125K. A break below $117K could see support at $111,799.

With U.S. macro catalysts looming, including the FOMC rate decision, Trump’s tariff deadline on Aug. 1, and a potential White House crypto report, traders should expect sharp volatility across both BTC and ETH. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Symmetrical Triangle Forming Technically, Bitcoin is inside a symmetrical triangle on the 4-hour chart, with price coiling between lower highs and rising trendline support. This is a setup for a big breakout. BTC is currently at $118,000, just below the 50-SMA at $118,204, which is now acting as resistance. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The RSI is at 48, neutral but rising, so momentum is building. Price just bounced off the ascending support at $117,025 and is making higher lows, which is bullish accumulation. Several small candles, including Dojis and spinning tops, are showing market indecision, which is common before a breakout. Key levels to watch: Resistance: $120,283 (top of triangle) Breakout targets: $122,845 and $125,408 Support: $117,025 then $114,532 and $111,799 If BTC breaks above $120,283 with volume and RSI strength, we should see momentum to $125K. A break below $117K could see support at $111,799. Bitcoin Hyper Presale Over $5.7M as Price Rise Nears Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , the first Bitcoin-native Layer 2 powered by the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), has raised over $5.7 million in its public presale, with $5,700,020 out of a $6,102,789 target. The token is priced at $0.01245, with the next price tier expected to be announced soon. Designed to merge Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s speed, Bitcoin Hyper enables fast, low-cost smart contracts, dApps, and meme coin creation, all with seamless BTC bridging. The project is audited by Consult and engineered for scalability, trust, and simplicity. The golden cross of meme appeal and real utility has made Bitcoin Hyper a Layer 2 contender to watch in 2025. With staking, a streamlined presale, and a full rollout expected by Q1, $HYPER is gaining serious traction. Th"
2025-07-30 10:25:10+00:00,Urgent Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why BTC Could Plunge to $110K,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Bitcoin Price Prediction: Why BTC Could Plunge to $110K Are you keeping a close eye on the volatile world of cryptocurrency? If so, you’re likely aware that Bitcoin (BTC) has been on a rollercoaster ride. Recent market movements suggest that the flagship cryptocurrency might be heading for a significant correction, potentially revisiting the $110,000 mark. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s an analysis backed by on-chain data and market dynamics, particularly concerning the latest Bitcoin price prediction . Understanding the Low-Volume “Air Gap” in Bitcoin Price Prediction Imagine a highway where traffic suddenly accelerates, leaving a vast, empty stretch behind. In financial markets, something similar can happen, and it’s called a low-volume “air gap.” This phenomenon occurs when an asset’s price surges rapidly through a specific range with very little trading activity. For Bitcoin, the recent swift climb from $110,000 to $115,000 created just such a void. Cointelegraph, citing data from the renowned on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, highlighted this crucial observation. What is an Air Gap? It’s a price range where minimal transactions occurred during a rapid ascent or descent. Think of it as a missing rung on a ladder – if the price needs to come down, there’s little support to slow its fall through that empty space. Why is it Significant? These gaps suggest limited investor interest or participation in that particular price zone during the initial move. This lack of activity makes the area vulnerable, as there aren’t many buyers or sellers positioned to defend the price if it starts to retrace. A Magnet for Price Reversion: Historically, such gaps often act like magnets, pulling the price back to “fill” the void. It’s not a guaranteed outcome, but it’s a strong indicator that traders and analysts closely monitor. The Role of Short-Term Holders in This Bitcoin Price Prediction Another critical factor contributing to this potential correction is the behavior of short-term holders (STHs). These are investors who typically hold their Bitcoin for less than 155 days. Glassnode’s data reveals that STHs have heavily accumulated BTC in the $117,000–$122,000 range. While accumulation by new entrants can be a sign of growing interest, heavy concentration in a specific, relatively high range can also signal vulnerability. Why does STH accumulation matter for our Bitcoin price prediction ? Profit-Taking Pressure: STHs are often more sensitive to price fluctuations and quicker to take profits or cut losses. If the price dips, these holders might be more inclined to sell, adding selling pressure to the market. Reduced Conviction: Unlike long-term holders who are typically unfazed by short-term volatility, STHs might lack the strong conviction to hold through significant drawdowns. Their entry at higher price points means their breakeven is closer to current levels, making them more susceptible to panic selling. Liquidity Dynamics: A large cohort of STHs holding at similar price points can create a significant liquidity pool that, if triggered, could exacerbate a downward move. Is This Similar to CME Futures Gaps? Let’s Compare! The concept of an “air gap” in spot markets shares similarities with unfilled gaps in CME Group Bitcoin futures. For those unfamiliar, CME futures gaps occur when the futures market opens at a price significantly different from its closing price, often over a weekend. These gaps, too, are frequently cited as potential magnets for price reversion. While the mechanics differ (one is a futures market phenomenon, the other a spot market liquidity void), the underlying principle is similar: a lack of trading activity in a specific price range creates an area of weakness that the market might eventually seek to re-test or fill. However, it’s crucial to remember that not all gaps are filled, and the timing of any potential fill is unpredictable. Glassnode emphasizes that the $110,000–$115,000 region is a critical support zone that requires close monitoring. Here’s a quick comparison: Feature Low-Volume “Air Gap” (Spot Market) CME Futures Gap Origin Rapid price movement with low trading volume.

Yet a lively sports meme coin, XYZVerse, moves the opposite way. Charts show steady gains while wider prices sink. Analysts note a blend of fan passion, clever rewards, and tight supply. Could this outsider jump fifty-fold before the next rebound arrives? The details behind the surge wait below. Eager holders refuse to sell so far. Undervalued $XYZ Meme Coin Gears Up for Listing on a Major CEX XYZVerse ($XYZ) is the meme coin that has grabbed headlines with its ambitious claim of rising from $0.0001 to $0.1 during a presale phase. So far, it has gone halfway, raising over $15 million, and the price of the $XYZ token currently stands at $0.005 . At the next 14th stage of the presale, the $XYZ token value will further rise to $0.01 , meaning that early investors have the chance to secure a bigger discount. Following the presale, $XYZ will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The team has not disclosed the details yet, but they have put a teaser for a big launch. Born for Fighters, Built for Champions XYZVerse is building a community for those hungry for big profits in crypto — the relentless, the ambitious, the ones aiming for dominance. This is a coin for true fighters — a mindset that resonates with athletes and sports fans alike. $XYZ is the token for thrill-seekers chasing the next big meme coin. Central to the XYZVerse story is XYZepe — a fighter in the meme coin arena, battling to climb the charts and make it to the top on CoinMarketCap. Will it become the next DOGE or SHIB? Time will tell.

Backed by solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and regular token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every move is designed to boost momentum, drive price growth, and rally a loyal community that knows this could be the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More — Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Bitcoin (BTC) Source: TradingView Bitcoin trades between $116040 and $121488 after a quiet but steady week. The coin edged up 1.27% in 7 days, adding to the pop it booked over the past month. A 10.73% surge in 30 days and a 14.64% climb in 6 months show a clear uptrend that keeps traders upbeat. The 10-day average sits near $118414, almost on top of the 100-day line at $117888. Such tight clustering hints at stability before the next move. Momentum gauges lean mildly bullish with mid-range readings that leave room for fresh bids. If buyers stay active, the chart suggests a push above the ceiling at $123578 could happen soon. A break of that cap would open the path to $129026, roughly 5% above the current top or 9% from the middle of today’s band. If sellers take charge instead, the first safety net lies at $112681, about 5% below, with deeper cover near $107232, a slip of around 9%. Given the solid half-year gains and still moderate momentum, odds favor a gradual grind higher, yet the tight range warns that any move will likely be sharp once the stalemate ends.

This significant capital injection comes from World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi project with reported links to the Trump family. This isn’t just about money; it’s a strategic alliance that could fundamentally reshape how we think about stablecoins and the future of an on-chain dollar standard. Let’s dive into what this groundbreaking development means for Falcon Finance and the broader crypto ecosystem. The Game-Changing Investment: What Does This Mean for Falcon Finance? On a recent announcement via its official X account, Falcon Finance confirmed the substantial $10 million strategic investment from World Liberty Financial. This isn’t merely a cash infusion; it represents a vote of confidence in Falcon Finance ‘s vision and its potential to innovate within the DeFi sector. For a project like Falcon Finance , such an investment brings a multitude of immediate and long-term benefits: Enhanced Development: The capital can accelerate the development of new features, improve existing protocols, and scale infrastructure to support a growing user base. This means faster rollouts of new tools and a more robust platform for users. Market Expansion: With increased resources, Falcon Finance can broaden its reach, attracting more users and institutional partners, potentially solidifying its position in the competitive DeFi landscape. This could involve targeted marketing campaigns and strategic outreach. Talent Acquisition: A robust financial backing allows Falcon Finance to attract top-tier talent in blockchain development, security, and marketing, further strengthening its core team. Bringing in leading experts can drive innovation and security improvements. Increased Liquidity: The investment can directly contribute to deeper liquidity pools, making the platform more robust and attractive for large-scale transactions. Deeper liquidity reduces slippage and makes the platform more efficient for all participants. This strategic move positions Falcon Finance not just as a participant, but as a potential leader in the evolving narrative of decentralized finance, particularly in the realm of stablecoins and collateralized lending. It signifies a maturation of the DeFi space, attracting significant capital from diverse sources. Understanding World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and Its Connection to Falcon Finance World Liberty Financial (WLFI) is a DeFi project that has garnered attention due to its reported links to the Trump family. While the exact nature of these links is often subject to discussion, WLFI aims to establish itself as a significant player in the decentralized finance space, particularly through its USD1 stablecoin. The partnership with Falcon Finance is a testament to WLFI’s ambition to expand the utility and adoption of its stablecoin. The strategic alignment between WLFI and Falcon Finance is multifaceted, demonstrating how different entities can converge in the pursuit of decentralized financial innovation: Shared Vision for Stablecoins: Both entities appear to share a vision for the widespread adoption and utility of stablecoins as a cornerstone of the future financial system. They recognize the need for stable, reliable digital assets in a volatile crypto market. Interoperability: WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin is already accepted as collateral on Falcon Finance , creating a direct bridge between their ecosystems and enhancing the utility of USD1. This integration makes USD1 a more versatile asset within the DeFi lending environment. Market Reach: WLFI’s association, whether direct or indirect, with a prominent political family can bring unique visibility and a distinct user base to the partnership, potentially introducing a new demographic to the DeFi world via Falcon Finance . This could accelerate mainstream awareness and adoption. This collaboration highlights a growing trend where established or politically connected entities are exploring and investing in the burgeoning DeFi sector, seeking to merge traditional financial influence with decentralized innovation. It also raises questions about the evolving nature of decentralization as more traditional players enter the space. The Rise of USD1: How Falcon Finance is Paving the Way for a New On-Chain Dollar Standard One of the most compelling aspects of this partnership is the role of WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by pegging their value to a stable asset like the US dollar.

2025-07-30 10:45:22+00:00,XRP Army Expects Big News As White House Is Set for Today’s Announcement,"XRP Army is waiting to hear big news today as the White House is set to release its first crypto policy report and digital asset stockpile. A tweet from crypto commentator Xaif has drawn attention to a major policy announcement scheduled for release today by the Trump administration. According to the tweet, the United States government is set to unveil its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile in its first formal national crypto policy report. Xaif highlights the potential inclusion of XRP in the government’s digital asset holdings, based on prior remarks made by Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House’s President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets.

XRP Army is waiting to hear big news today as the White House is set to release its first crypto policy report and digital asset stockpile. A tweet from crypto commentator Xaif has drawn attention to a major policy announcement scheduled for release today by the Trump administration. According to the tweet, the United States government is set to unveil its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile in its first formal national crypto policy report. Xaif highlights the potential inclusion of XRP in the government’s digital asset holdings, based on prior remarks made by Bo Hines, Executive Director of the White House’s President’s Council of Advisers on Digital Assets.

Was I emotional? Did I feel FOMO? Did I skip obvious trades or chase bad ones?” Dentoshi keeps her weekly journaling short and focused – no six-hour essays – but always tracks: What setups worked best (and why) What trades did she skip that ended up working out perfectly according to her plan Her emotional state during winners and losers The goal?

2025-07-30 10:51:08+00:00,Bitcoin''s Rise May Be More Difficult From Now On! Analysis Firm Explains Why!,"Bitcoin saw a massive surge following Donald Trump''s victory in November last year. The rise that began in the last months of 2024 continued in 2025, and BTC reached triple-digit figures. At this point, BTC reached its new ATH of $123,000 in July but subsequently experienced a decline in bullish momentum. Evaluating Bitcoin''s recent movements, 10X Research analyst Markus Thielen stated that Bitcoin has entered its weakest period after its impressive rises. 10X Research stated in its latest report that its seasonality model has been consistent with all its predictions so far. Accordingly, this model now signals a bearish trend for BTC. August was Bitcoin''s worst month in the last 12 years, with prices falling in eight of those 12. September was no different, with Bitcoin experiencing an average decline of 4.6% in eight of the last 12 years. Citing these data, the analyst stated that apart from seasonal weakness, the slowdown in ETF and capital inflows also increases the risk of a decline. At this point, 10X Research stated that it is more difficult for Bitcoin to reach targets such as $140,000 and $150,000, adding that the price must overcome a crowded resistance level before reaching $140,000. The report noted that Bitcoin''s key resistance levels are located around $112,000 and $115,000. Without strong momentum, Bitcoin may struggle to break through these levels, according to the analyst. If the price declines, support zones around $106,000 and $94,000 could come into play. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Bitcoin''s Rise May Be More Difficult From Now On!

2025-07-30 11:00:00+00:00,Wall Street Meets Web3: Institutions Pour Into Bitcoin Swift for Unmatched Privacy and Compliance,"Bitcoin Swift (BTC3) is not just refining how networks reward users. It is overhauling broken incentive structures entirely. By using programmable Proof-of-Yield, BTC3 shifts rewards away from static models and toward real-time metrics that prioritize sustainability and network contribution. This evolution is why institutions are paying attention. The market is shifting hard toward automated, compliant infrastructure that can scale. Bitcoin Swift is leading that wave with what is quickly becoming the most utility-driven presale in Web3 today. Enterprise-Ready PoY and Exploding Interest Unlike the outdated reward systems that depend on power and hash rate, Bitcoin Swift’s Proof-of-Yield dynamically adapts based on energy use, network demand, and governance votes. This makes the system predictable, fair, and transparent, exactly what institutional investors look for. Influencers are helping push this awareness to the public. A breakdown by Crypto Infinity and Crypto Vlog , along with content from Token Empire, Crypto Sister, and Crypto League, showcases why Bitcoin Swift is trending across social channels and investor forums. AI-Powered Energy Efficiency BTC3 integrates federated AI oracles that constantly monitor the network’s carbon usage and efficiency. Users contributing through low-impact systems receive better PoY distribution. The reward engine reacts in real time and penalizes high-consumption setups. This gives Bitcoin Swift a built-in sustainability model that goes far beyond marketing. And it is verified. The Spywolf Audit , Solidproof Audit , and KYC certification all confirm BTC3’s commitment to operational transparency and compliance from day one. BTC3E Stablecoin and Vault Architecture BTC3 also powers BTC3E, a USD-pegged stablecoin backed by locked BTC3 inside smart contract vaults. Each unit is overcollateralized at a ratio of at least one hundred fifty percent. If collateral drops, liquidation is triggered automatically by the protocol. AI price oracles monitor asset values and update the contract parameters to protect the peg. This system is designed for stability under volatility, enabling fast, trusted transactions. Learn more at the official Bitcoin Swift Website or follow daily updates via X . Reward Logic: Structured and Transparent Unlike generic airdrops, BTC3’s staking rewards are programmed, timed, and performance-based. Smart contracts track user behavior and distribute PoY rewards at the end of each presale stage. There is no delay and no guesswork. This creates a structured, reliable experience where returns are tied to contribution and ecosystem growth. Institutions value consistency and clarity, and Bitcoin Swift delivers both through fully transparent code and rules. Tokenomics: Designed for Long-Term Sustainability Bitcoin Swift has a fixed total supply of 45 million tokens. The distribution reflects a focus on utility and decentralization rather than hype: 50% or 22.5 million BTC3 is allocated to Proof-of-Yield rewards, distributed over 30 years 30% or 13.5 million BTC3 goes to presale participants, granting them early ecosystem access 15% is allocated for liquidity provisioning across exchanges 5% is set aside for additional reserves and project team operations This model ensures long-term network alignment while giving early adopters real utility and governance access from day oneBtc3 Condensed Whitepaper. Presale Snapshot: One Of The Shortest Presales To Exist Bitcoin Swift is currently in Stage 2 of its 64-day presale, ending on September 18, 2025. The token is now priced at $2, with only 2 days left before the next price increase, with Stage 3 increasing to $3. The confirmed public launch price is $15, representing significant upside for early participants. BTC3 will launch on Orca , one of Solana’s most active DEX platforms. During Stage 2, PoY rewards yield a 133% APY, automatically distributed at the end of the stage. This is one of the shortest, most utility-backed presales on the market, and institutions are taking notice. Conclusion Bitcoin Swift is not just gaining traction. It is becoming a cornerstone of the compliance-ready blockchain movement. With programmable income, AI automation, identity privacy, and vault-backed stablecoins, BTC3 offers a complete foundation for institutional and retail adoption alike. Early participants are not betting on hype. They are securing a position inside a working protocol that rewards contribution, enforces sustainability, and scales with real-world needs.

2025-07-30 11:00:09+00:00,BlackRock Goes Heavy on Ethereum: Buys 4x More ETH Than BTC,"Ethereum has entered a volatile and decisive phase following weeks of strong buying pressure and rapid price appreciation. After pushing above $3,800, ETH is now facing resistance, with bulls stepping in to defend key lower demand zones. The market appears uncertain, caught between a potential continuation toward new highs and the risk of a broader cooldown. Related Reading: Abraxas Capital Faces $100M Unrealized Loss On $800M Crypto Short Positions – Details Adding to the momentum, new data from Arkham reveals that BlackRock purchased over four times more Ethereum than Bitcoin last week. This shift marks a significant moment for institutional involvement in Ethereum and signals growing confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts across the industry are beginning to take note, interpreting the move as a signal that Ethereum may be gaining favor among traditional finance giants. As Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs, Ethereum now stands at a crossroads. Will it continue climbing and close the gap, or will rejection above $3,800 mark the beginning of a local top? BlackRock’s Ethereum Allocation Signals Growing Institutional Shift Arkham data has revealed a significant development in institutional crypto allocation: BlackRock purchased over $1.2 billion worth of Ethereum last week, compared to just $267 million in Bitcoin. This 4.5x disparity signals a decisive shift in institutional strategy, with capital now flowing more aggressively into ETH than BTC. For many in the market, this is what true institutional Ethereum adoption looks like—massive inflows that reshape market dynamics. This shift didn’t start overnight. Institutional interest in Ethereum began building back in April, when ETH hit a cycle low near $1,380. Since then, a combination of legal clarity, progress around ETF approval, and Ethereum’s maturing role in the financial ecosystem has fueled a steady wave of accumulation from large players. BlackRock’s latest allocation is simply the most visible and significant confirmation of that trend. As the broader crypto market heats up, Ethereum appears well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. However, not everything is straightforward. ETH is now struggling to break through resistance around the $3,800 level, and the failure to reclaim new highs is beginning to stir uncertainty.

Ethereum has entered a volatile and decisive phase following weeks of strong buying pressure and rapid price appreciation. After pushing above $3,800, ETH is now facing resistance, with bulls stepping in to defend key lower demand zones. The market appears uncertain, caught between a potential continuation toward new highs and the risk of a broader cooldown. Related Reading: Abraxas Capital Faces $100M Unrealized Loss On $800M Crypto Short Positions – Details Adding to the momentum, new data from Arkham reveals that BlackRock purchased over four times more Ethereum than Bitcoin last week. This shift marks a significant moment for institutional involvement in Ethereum and signals growing confidence in its long-term potential. Analysts across the industry are beginning to take note, interpreting the move as a signal that Ethereum may be gaining favor among traditional finance giants. As Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs, Ethereum now stands at a crossroads. Will it continue climbing and close the gap, or will rejection above $3,800 mark the beginning of a local top? BlackRock’s Ethereum Allocation Signals Growing Institutional Shift Arkham data has revealed a significant development in institutional crypto allocation: BlackRock purchased over $1.2 billion worth of Ethereum last week, compared to just $267 million in Bitcoin. This 4.5x disparity signals a decisive shift in institutional strategy, with capital now flowing more aggressively into ETH than BTC. For many in the market, this is what true institutional Ethereum adoption looks like—massive inflows that reshape market dynamics. This shift didn’t start overnight. Institutional interest in Ethereum began building back in April, when ETH hit a cycle low near $1,380. Since then, a combination of legal clarity, progress around ETF approval, and Ethereum’s maturing role in the financial ecosystem has fueled a steady wave of accumulation from large players. BlackRock’s latest allocation is simply the most visible and significant confirmation of that trend. As the broader crypto market heats up, Ethereum appears well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. However, not everything is straightforward. ETH is now struggling to break through resistance around the $3,800 level, and the failure to reclaim new highs is beginning to stir uncertainty. Some analysts warn that the current rally may lose steam without a breakout, and fear of a short-term correction is growing.

2025-07-30 11:00:40+00:00,Analyst Says Everyone Is Wrong about XRP’s Price. Here’s Why,"Crypto analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO has reignited bullish sentiment around XRP , declaring that “everyone is wrong” about its current price trajectory. In a new technical breakdown shared via X, Steph argues that XRP is nearing a critical breakout moment on its long-term chart, one that could drive exponential growth through the rest of 2025. However, while his analysis focuses on an emerging bullish structure, some of the associated claims about XRP’s price levels require careful clarification. The Chart Pattern Everyone Missed According to Steph, XRP has been following an ascending resistance trendline on its monthly time frame since 2021. This line has been respected with multiple touches over the years, and he believes XRP is now approaching a crucial inflection point. “The moment we break this trendline,” he said, “it’s lights out. Fireworks for XRP.” EVERYONE IS WRONG ABOUT #XRP ''S PRICE… pic.twitter.com/Kb5zGsk7nw — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) July 29, 2025 To support his claim, Steph compares XRP’s current setup to Bitcoin’s chart from 2021, which showed a similar three-touch trendline structure. Bitcoin broke out decisively from that pattern, and Steph suggests XRP may be poised to do the same, potentially igniting a similar rally. The $3.28 Breakout Threshold Steph identifies $3.28 as the “line in the sand” for XRP. A monthly candle close above this level, he says, would confirm a breakout from the multi-year trendline and signal the beginning of a sustained upward move. Notably, XRP surged as high as $3.65 on July 18, 2025, surpassing its previous all-time high; however, it has since pulled back. As of report time, XRP is trading at $3.10 with intraday swings between $3.06 and $3.17. The asset would require a minimum of 6% rise to break the threshold identified by Steph. Momentum from Korea and Institutional Tailwinds Steph also points to significant buying pressure coming from South Korean exchanges. This regional demand has helped fuel XRP’s recent gains, with volumes surging over the past month. More importantly, institutional interest continues to build. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bloomberg analysts now give a 95% probability that an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) could be approved by 2025 . This would mark a significant milestone for XRP, opening the door to billions in institutional capital. Combined with Ripple’s growing footprint in global finance and increasing adoption of XRP Ledger solutions, the long-term outlook appears strong. What Comes Next As July comes to a close, all eyes are on whether XRP can end the month above $3.28. A confirmed breakout at this level would strengthen the case for a sustained rally into Q3 and beyond. Steph remains confident: “The third quarter could be huge for altcoins, and XRP is positioned better than most. The market is still asleep, and that’s when the biggest moves tend to happen.” Whether XRP breaks out this month or later, one thing is clear: the chart is tightening, momentum is building, and the market is paying attention.

2025-07-30 11:02:14+00:00,"Company Raises Another 5,800 Bitcoins in ‘Gold Rush’ – Here’s Why $HYPER Is a Great Buy Now","Twenty One Capital, a corporate Bitcoin treasury seeking public listing on the US stock exchange, has announced that they’re increasing their holdings by 5,800 Bitcoins. That puts their overall holdings at ~$5.1B, making them the third largest corporate Bitcoin holder . Currently, only Strategy and Mara Holdings own more Bitcoin at 628,791BTC and 50,000BTC respectively. This is fantastic news if you’re a long-term Bitcoin investor. It proves that Bitcoin is being taken seriously in the corporate world. But Bitcoin is quite pricey now, and in that case, it’s worth taking a look at Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a new crypto presale. The project wants to upgrade the Bitcoin blockchain to modern standards – add dApp and smart contract compatibility, for one. Given the current bullish state of affairs, we believe $HYPER is looking at an explosive future. Why Is Twenty One’s Acquisition Good for Bitcoin? The team behind Twenty One Capital is confident that Bitcoin is the future of digital currency. We believe Bitcoin deserves a public company worthy of its ethos. Twenty One is a new kind of public company: built on Bitcoin, backed with proof, and driven by a vision to reshape the global financial system. We’re not here to beat the existing system, we’re here to build a new one. —Jack Mallers, Twenty One CEO, Twenty One Capital PR As a publicly traded company, Twenty One Capital will trade under the ‘XXI’ ticker. Traders will be able to track its performance with a ‘Bitcoin per Share’ metric provided by Twenty One Capital. And on-chain proof of the company’s Bitcoin holdings is available via xxi.mempool.space , providing full transparency for investors. It’s pretty clear that confidence in Bitcoin is growing by the day. This much institutional adoption signals that it’s not just a speculative asset, but a long-term store of value that can perform better than traditional assets. Case in point, Bitcoin grew by 77% in the last year , from ~$66K to $118K today, reaching an ATH of $123K in July. Some traders are even beginning to think of Bitcoin as the equivalent of digital gold. Bitcoin companies like Twenty One Capital adopting a Bitcoin-heavy portfolio shows that there’s a bright future for Bitcoin, as well as projects that seek to expand the reach or functionality of the Bitcoin network. Projects like Bitcoin Hyper, which plans to upscale the Bitcoin blockchain to modern, 21st century standards. Why Bitcoin Hyper? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER ) is the solution to woes that have been plaguing the Bitcoin network for over a decade. While Bitcoin is a great store of value, transactions are processed relatively slowly (around 7/second vs Tron’s 2,000/second, for instance) and at greater cost compared to newer blockchains like Solana and Ethereum. Bitcoin Hyper promises to solve all these problems by bridging the Bitcoin blockchain to a Layer 2 solution built on the Solana Virtual Machine , unlocking powerful smart-contract capabilities for Bitcoin-based dApps. Through a Canonical Bridge, you’ll be able to lock in your Bitcoins and receive equivalent wrapped Bitcoin on the L2. You can change back to $BTC whenever you want to. The gist of it is that $HYPER will process transactions on the much faster L2 and execute them on Bitcoin’s L1. This way, you get both speed and security under the hood. The presale has already attracted over $5.8M, signalling confidence in Bitcoin Hyper’s proposed solutions to hyper-charge the Bitcoin Network. With a mainnet launch in Q3 2025, now’s the perfect time to check out the Bitcoin Hyper project. $HYPER holders also receive voting rights for governance proposals, lower transaction fees across the Bitcoin Hyper network, and a lucrative staking opportunity currently valued at 176% APR. The token is currently worth $0.01245 (and we expect it to jump to $0.08625 by the end of 2025 ), and you can buy it from the official presale page . Summary As more financial institutions turn their eye towards Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, early adopters get to ride the price higher and higher. It’s no longer about speculation. Holding firms like Strategy, Twenty One Capital, and even Trump Media are leaning into the rock-solid value Bitcoin provides as an asset. That’s why it’s time to get on board and ride the rocketship. While Bitcoin might not have the same explosive potential it had a decade ago, it’s also significantly less risky to bet on a crypto backed by billions of dollars worth of capital funds. However, Bitcoin isn’t a perfect solution—yet. Bitcoin Hyper looks set to fix the outstanding issues with the Bitcoin Network and pump while doing so. Remember to do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose. Presales are very volatile, and price movements can appear suddenly.

2025-07-30 11:25:10+00:00,Bitcoin Futures: The Calm Before the Storm? Unpacking the Market’s Next Ascent,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Futures: The Calm Before the Storm? Unpacking the Market’s Next Ascent Are you feeling the quiet hum in the cryptocurrency market? After periods of intense volatility and speculative frenzy, it appears the Bitcoin market is taking a breather. Specifically, the activity around Bitcoin futures has seen a noticeable cooling, even as prices hover near significant levels like $123,000. This seemingly subdued atmosphere isn’t a sign of weakness; rather, it could be the strategic pause before Bitcoin embarks on its next exhilarating journey towards new heights. Let’s delve into what this ‘cooling’ means for the world’s leading cryptocurrency and what it signals for its future. What’s Happening with Bitcoin Futures Right Now? The futures market, a crucial barometer for investor sentiment and leverage, has shown a significant reduction in speculative activity surrounding Bitcoin. According to insights from CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, this cooling indicates a decrease in overall leverage and risk-taking among traders. But what exactly does that entail? Reduced Open Interest: This refers to the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not been settled. A decrease suggests fewer new positions are being opened, and existing ones are being closed, indicating a deleveraging event. Lower Funding Rates: In perpetual futures markets, funding rates are periodic payments exchanged between long and short positions. Positive funding rates mean longs pay shorts (indicating bullish sentiment and demand for long positions), while negative rates mean shorts pay longs. Lower or even negative funding rates suggest less aggressive long-side speculation. Diminished Premium: The difference between the futures price and the spot price (known as the basis or premium) tends to shrink during a cooling period. A high premium indicates strong bullish sentiment and a willingness to pay more for future exposure, whereas a low premium suggests a more balanced or even bearish outlook. This collective reduction in these metrics paints a picture of a market that is shedding its excess baggage of over-leveraged positions. Think of it like a race car pitting for a tire change and fuel refill – it’s not stopping because it’s broken, but rather preparing for the next high-speed lap. Why Does a Cooled Bitcoin Futures Market Matter? While some might interpret reduced activity as a lack of interest, in the context of cryptocurrencies, it’s often a healthy sign. The cryptocurrency market, especially Bitcoin, has a history of dramatic rallies often preceded by periods of consolidation and deleveraging. Here’s why this cooling trend in Bitcoin futures is significant: Clearing the Path for Organic Demand When the market is flushed with high leverage, even small price movements can trigger large liquidations, creating cascading sell-offs. This volatility, while exciting, isn’t sustainable for long-term growth. A reduction in leverage means: Less Volatility from Liquidations: With fewer over-leveraged positions, the market becomes less susceptible to sudden, sharp drops caused by liquidation cascades. Focus on Spot Buying: When futures speculation subsides, the market’s price discovery relies more heavily on actual buying and selling of Bitcoin on spot exchanges. This ‘organic demand’ comes from genuine investors who are accumulating Bitcoin for its long-term value, rather than short-term speculative gains. Stronger Foundations: A market driven by organic demand builds a more robust and sustainable price floor. It signifies conviction from long-term holders and new entrants who believe in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition. This shift from speculative-driven price action to demand-driven growth is crucial for establishing a solid foundation for future price appreciation. It suggests that current price support is coming from genuine interest, not just leveraged bets. Is This the Precursor to a New Bitcoin All-Time High? The sentiment from experts like ShayanMarkets suggests that this market reset could indeed pave the way for a new all-time high for Bitcoin. Historically, significant price rallies have often followed periods where the market ‘cleansed’ itself of excessive speculation. Consider the following points: Historical Precedent: If we look back at previous bull cycles, such as those in 2017 and 2021, there were often mid-cycle corrections or consolidation phases where leverage was flushed out. These periods, though painful for some traders, ultimately served as springboards for the next leg up. The current scenario with Bitcoin futures shows similar characteristics: Market Phase Futures Market Behavior Typical Outcome Early Bull Run / Initial Rally Rising open interest, positive funding rates, high premium.

2025-07-30 11:44:09+00:00,Cryptos to Buy Before Altcoin Season Explodes Like Bitwise CIO Predicts,"Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts that TradFi firms will start scooping up altcoins after making ‘tons of money’ on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Should that happen, there might not be a better time to learn about the best altcoins to buy now, and get in while their prices are still low. Keep reading for our top three suggestions. Hougan Predicts $BTC to $200K, Altcoin Season Next In a recent interview with The Wolf of All Streets , Hougan explained that institutional investors are now hunting for the next big opportunity beyond $BTC. ‘All this money flowed into Bitcoin. The price went up 140%. And what are they going to do? They’re going to rotate into like Kellogg’s? No, they’re going to rotate into Circle, Ethereum, and treasury companies… It’s going to go all the way. It’s altseason in TradFi for sure.’ – Hougan. Hougan then went on to discuss how he thinks that ‘Bitcoin is going to $200K by the end of this year’ and that Ethereum is experiencing a massive demand shock due to unprecedented institutional buying. ‘There is this supply-demand shock in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. And I didn’t study that much economics, but I know enough that when demand is 5 to 10x supply, the price tends to go up. And I think that’s just the story in crypto right now,’ Hougan added. He also pointed out that nearly every day in July saw net inflows into Ethereum ETFs, with over $4.4B pouring in this month alone. As a result, he believes that $ETH has moved from a speculative asset to a must-have for institutional portfolios alongside $BTC. And it’s no wonder, given the number of institutions accumulating $ETH right now. One such example is blockchain infrastructure firm BTCS Inc., which recently added 14,240 $$ETH to its portfolio . This pushed its total holdings to a hefty 70,028 $ETH, valued at around $270M at the time of purchase. With capital rotating out of $BTC into altcoins, Hougan believes the market is just getting started. While it may feel like we’re at a peak, he says we’re ‘actually in the early innings,’ comparing today’s stance with the early days of the internet boom in 1998. Early-stage altcoins like $BEST , $HYPER , and $ENA are still under the radar. Naturally, this makes now a prime time to invest in them before the broader market catches on and their prices likely shoot up. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Foundation of a #1 Anonymous Crypto Wallet $BEST is the native token of Best Wallet , a non-custodial crypto wallet designed to give you complete control over your digital assets. Owing to the fact that it gives you exclusive access to your private keys and doesn’t require KYC verification, it’s ranked as our #1 anonymous crypto wallet . The Best Wallet mobile app also leverages Fireblocks Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology to safeguard your keys while enabling encrypted cloud backups. This also removes the burden of managing seed phrases manually. Security is becoming increasingly vital in the crypto world. This year alone, $2.1B+ worth of crypto has been mostly stolen through private key breaches . Still, Best Wallet has a lot more to offer than urgent safeguarding measures. Its support of 1K+ digital assets, soon across 60 chains, makes it a one-stop powerhouse for crypto. Thanks to its Cross-Chain Swap feature, you can also access 330+ decentralized exchanges and 30+ bridges. Doing so unlocks the best rates and lowest fees when moving assets across networks. And it has tons to look forward to, including Best Card (its own crypto debit card), an NFT gallery, a rewards hub, and market intel analytics. To get the most out of Best Wallet, you’ll want to hold some $BEST. Then, you can enjoy lower transaction fees, governance rights, early entry to the best crypto presales , and staking rewards at a 94%. $BEST has already raised over $14.3M, with one whale investing $49.5K into the project alone. It’s clear that hype surrounding the Best Wallet ecosystem is building. You can currently buy $BEST on presale for just $0.025405. New developments like Best Card could push its price to $0.072 this year, setting the stage for possible 193%+ gains if you join the action now. 2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Layer 2 Solution Set to Upgrade Bitcoin in Q3 2025 Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the presale token behind a Layer 2 network that will speed up Bitcoin in Q3 2025. It aims to tackle some of Bitcoin’s most significant limitations by speeding up transactions, slashing fees dramatically, and introducing full smart contract support.

Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan predicts that TradFi firms will start scooping up altcoins after making ‘tons of money’ on Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Should that happen, there might not be a better time to learn about the best altcoins to buy now, and get in while their prices are still low. Keep reading for our top three suggestions. Hougan Predicts $BTC to $200K, Altcoin Season Next In a recent interview with The Wolf of All Streets , Hougan explained that institutional investors are now hunting for the next big opportunity beyond $BTC. ‘All this money flowed into Bitcoin. The price went up 140%. And what are they going to do? They’re going to rotate into like Kellogg’s? No, they’re going to rotate into Circle, Ethereum, and treasury companies… It’s going to go all the way. It’s altseason in TradFi for sure.’ – Hougan. Hougan then went on to discuss how he thinks that ‘Bitcoin is going to $200K by the end of this year’ and that Ethereum is experiencing a massive demand shock due to unprecedented institutional buying. ‘There is this supply-demand shock in both Bitcoin and Ethereum. And I didn’t study that much economics, but I know enough that when demand is 5 to 10x supply, the price tends to go up. And I think that’s just the story in crypto right now,’ Hougan added. He also pointed out that nearly every day in July saw net inflows into Ethereum ETFs, with over $4.4B pouring in this month alone. As a result, he believes that $ETH has moved from a speculative asset to a must-have for institutional portfolios alongside $BTC. And it’s no wonder, given the number of institutions accumulating $ETH right now. One such example is blockchain infrastructure firm BTCS Inc., which recently added 14,240 $$ETH to its portfolio . This pushed its total holdings to a hefty 70,028 $ETH, valued at around $270M at the time of purchase. With capital rotating out of $BTC into altcoins, Hougan believes the market is just getting started. While it may feel like we’re at a peak, he says we’re ‘actually in the early innings,’ comparing today’s stance with the early days of the internet boom in 1998. Early-stage altcoins like $BEST , $HYPER , and $ENA are still under the radar. Naturally, this makes now a prime time to invest in them before the broader market catches on and their prices likely shoot up. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – The Foundation of a #1 Anonymous Crypto Wallet $BEST is the native token of Best Wallet , a non-custodial crypto wallet designed to give you complete control over your digital assets. Owing to the fact that it gives you exclusive access to your private keys and doesn’t require KYC verification, it’s ranked as our #1 anonymous crypto wallet . The Best Wallet mobile app also leverages Fireblocks Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology to safeguard your keys while enabling encrypted cloud backups. This also removes the burden of managing seed phrases manually. Security is becoming increasingly vital in the crypto world. This year alone, $2.1B+ worth of crypto has been mostly stolen through private key breaches . Still, Best Wallet has a lot more to offer than urgent safeguarding measures. Its support of 1K+ digital assets, soon across 60 chains, makes it a one-stop powerhouse for crypto. Thanks to its Cross-Chain Swap feature, you can also access 330+ decentralized exchanges and 30+ bridges. Doing so unlocks the best rates and lowest fees when moving assets across networks. And it has tons to look forward to, including Best Card (its own crypto debit card), an NFT gallery, a rewards hub, and market intel analytics. To get the most out of Best Wallet, you’ll want to hold some $BEST. Then, you can enjoy lower transaction fees, governance rights, early entry to the best crypto presales , and staking rewards at a 94%. $BEST has already raised over $14.3M, with one whale investing $49.5K into the project alone. It’s clear that hype surrounding the Best Wallet ecosystem is building. You can currently buy $BEST on presale for just $0.025405. New developments like Best Card could push its price to $0.072 this year, setting the stage for possible 193%+ gains if you join the action now. 2.

On July 18th, COIN soared to a new all-time high of $444.65, eclipsing its previous record level of $429, which it hit on April 14th, 2021. Within three days of the rally, ARK Invest began offloading Coinbase shares – an aggressive move that knocked COIN from the firm’s top holding to second place. Data from Cathiesark.com shows that the firm unloaded $105,300,000 worth of COIN from July 21st to 24th. While ARK Invest was selling COIN, it was busy snapping up shares of the electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla (TSLA). The investment firm gobbled up $43.7 million worth of TSLA from July 21st to the 24th. At time of writing, TSLA is the firm’s top holding, accumulating a $1 billion stake in the Elon Musk-led firm. Coinbase ranks 2nd, with the firm now holding $803.5 million worth of COIN shares. ARK Invest’s aggressive accumulation of TSLA comes after its CEO, Cathie Wood, predicted that the stock would be worth thousands of dollars by 2030. “Our prediction in five years is $2,600, and 90% of that valuation comes not from the electric vehicle, but from this robotaxi platform.

The plan, titled the Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy, aims to give Cardano a strong, cohesive presence at top-tier blockchain conferences such as TOKEN2049 and Consensus. Backed by nearly 80% of community voters in the initial round, the proposal has now reached its final phase: a Treasury Withdrawal vote that will determine whether it gets funded. The strategy comes at a critical time. Cardano has the technology and an active developer community, but it has often struggled with fragmented messaging and minimal visibility at major events.

EMURGO funds TOKEN2049 Singapore to start branding revamp EMURGO has already acted on its vision by paying upfront for a significant Cardano showcase at TOKEN2049 Singapore, one of the most influential Web3 conferences globally.

This exploration comes as the online brokerage, which went public on the Nasdaq in May, evaluates partnerships with various blockchain ecosystems. eToro Reveals Plans For Potential Blockchain Development Assia mentioned that eToro is in discussions with “four or five” different platforms, although he did not disclose specific names. He emphasized that any blockchain launch is not immediate, but indicated that a side chain—essentially a lightweight blockchain built atop another—might be a viable solution for their operations. Assia highlighted the limitations of existing blockchains, stating, “We can’t run today the millions of transactions that we’re transacting on a monthly basis on existing blockchains.” The executive believes that a dedicated blockchain is necessary to support the entire eToro ecosystem and accommodate its user base and transaction volume. The timing of Assia’s comments coincided with eToro’s announcement of its plans to introduce tokenized stocks on the Ethereum blockchain . Tokenization refers to the process of converting traditional stocks into digital assets that can be traded more efficiently on the blockchain. This new feature will allow users to trade tokenized stocks 24/7, with an initial offering of 100 popular US companies and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Currently, access to these blockchain-based assets will be available only to European users on a wait-list basis. ERC20 Tokenized Shares For US Companies Bloomberg further reported that eToro aims to launch tokenized versions of US-listed stocks, enabling round-the-clock trading. The assets will be issued as ERC20 tokens on Ethereum, allowing users to transfer tokenized shares between eToro digital wallets. The platform will initially support 24/5 trading, expanding the accessibility of these assets for users. “This is really the beginning of digital assets and tokenized real-world assets,” Assia stated during a recent webinar. He expressed enthusiasm about merging eToro’s crypto wallet services with the stock trading environment, creating a seamless experience for customers who deal in both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities. This strategic move follows a similar initiative by competitor Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), which announced plans to offer tokenized US securities to its European customers. However, Robinhood’s announcement faced skepticism from regulators, particularly due to its association with a promotional giveaway of OpenAI “tokens” that were later clarified as derivative contracts rather than actual equity. As of Tuesday’s close, eToro’s stock, ETOR, had dropped 4%, closing at $60 per share. This decline represents a %24 gap from its record peak of $79 reached on June 10.

2025-07-30 12:00:39+00:00,White House Gears Up to Publish Key Report on U.S. Crypto Strategy,"A cryptocurrency task force established by President Donald Trump is expected to release its long-awaited report on Wednesday, detailing the administration’s digital asset policy objectives. According to Reuters , this will be the group’s first public update and will reflect months of behind-the-scenes coordination to craft the White House’s stance on tokenization, crypto markets, and blockchain-based financial products. The report follows Trump’s January executive order, which called for developing a comprehensive national approach to cryptocurrency regulation and innovation. Reuters reports that the policy document will offer guidance on what legislation and regulatory frameworks should be pursued to align with the administration’s pro-crypto goals. One source told Reuters the report is expected to recommend a defined role for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regulating blockchain-based securities such as tokenized stocks and bonds. A second source indicated that the document would also reflect the administration’s position on ongoing congressional efforts to establish clearer rules for the crypto industry. Mortgage and Retirement Accounts Could Include Crypto One of the most anticipated elements of the upcoming report is the potential inclusion of digital assets in traditional financial systems, particularly mortgages and retirement savings plans like 401(k)s. If implemented, this would represent a landmark shift in how crypto holdings are treated within mainstream finance. “If the report backs the inclusion of digital assets in mortgage assessments and 401(k) plans, it would mark a significant change in how digital asset wealth is treated,” said Liat Shetret, Vice President of Global Policy and Regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. Such a move could have wide-reaching effects. For homebuyers who hold substantial crypto assets, these could be counted toward their financial profile, potentially increasing mortgage access for a new class of crypto-first consumers. However, it would also introduce new challenges for banks and lenders, including how to assess, verify, and safeguard volatile and decentralized assets. Strategic Reserve and Regulatory Clarity While some in the crypto space are eyeing the possibility of a strategic bitcoin reserve or national digital asset stockpile, experts say that regulatory clarity is far more important. Shetret stresses that institutions are eager for streamlined oversight and consistency. “Many are watching closely for signals around a pro-growth and innovation-friendly federal regulatory framework that balances a commitment to making the U.S. the global center for digital assets while also maintaining financial integrity, adds Shetret. Such a framework would likely involve cross-agency coordination, with defined supervisory roles for the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury. Industry Braces for Policy Impact The release of the report could reshape the U.S. crypto landscape and send ripple effects through global markets. While speculative attention focuses on dramatic initiatives like a bitcoin reserve, the true impact may come from how the U.S. integrates digital assets into legacy financial systems, and the degree to which legal and regulatory ambiguity is resolved. Earlier this month, in a landmark week for the U.S. crypto industry, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law . The move marked a seismic shift in the regulatory framework for digital assets, particularly dollar-backed stablecoins, and indicated a broader push by the Trump administration to bring clarity and control to the sector. Weekly Crypto Regulation Roundup: Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law — the first major U.S. crypto bill to clear Congress. #CryptoRegulation #GeniusAct https://t.co/fSH8DZnCIo — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 The post White House Gears Up to Publish Key Report on U.S. Crypto Strategy appeared first on Cryptonews .",cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/trump-set-to-unveil-digital-assets-policy-blueprint-mortgage-integration-401k-inclusion-on-agenda/,REGULATION|FIAT|BTC|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,Crypto Regulation News|News|Crypto Regulation|Trump|Whitehouse,BTC,"White House Gears Up to Publish Key Report on U.S. Crypto Strategy. A cryptocurrency task force established by President Donald Trump is expected to release its long-awaited report on Wednesday, detailing the administration’s digital asset policy objectives. According to Reuters , this will be the group’s first public update and will reflect months of behind-the-scenes coordination to craft the White House’s stance on tokenization, crypto markets, and blockchain-based financial products. The report follows Trump’s January executive order, which called for developing a comprehensive national approach to cryptocurrency regulation and innovation. Reuters reports that the policy document will offer guidance on what legislation and regulatory frameworks should be pursued to align with the administration’s pro-crypto goals. One source told Reuters the report is expected to recommend a defined role for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regulating blockchain-based securities such as tokenized stocks and bonds. A second source indicated that the document would also reflect the administration’s position on ongoing congressional efforts to establish clearer rules for the crypto industry. Mortgage and Retirement Accounts Could Include Crypto One of the most anticipated elements of the upcoming report is the potential inclusion of digital assets in traditional financial systems, particularly mortgages and retirement savings plans like 401(k)s. If implemented, this would represent a landmark shift in how crypto holdings are treated within mainstream finance. “If the report backs the inclusion of digital assets in mortgage assessments and 401(k) plans, it would mark a significant change in how digital asset wealth is treated,” said Liat Shetret, Vice President of Global Policy and Regulation at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. Such a move could have wide-reaching effects. For homebuyers who hold substantial crypto assets, these could be counted toward their financial profile, potentially increasing mortgage access for a new class of crypto-first consumers. However, it would also introduce new challenges for banks and lenders, including how to assess, verify, and safeguard volatile and decentralized assets. Strategic Reserve and Regulatory Clarity While some in the crypto space are eyeing the possibility of a strategic bitcoin reserve or national digital asset stockpile, experts say that regulatory clarity is far more important. Shetret stresses that institutions are eager for streamlined oversight and consistency. “Many are watching closely for signals around a pro-growth and innovation-friendly federal regulatory framework that balances a commitment to making the U.S. the global center for digital assets while also maintaining financial integrity, adds Shetret. Such a framework would likely involve cross-agency coordination, with defined supervisory roles for the SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Treasury. Industry Braces for Policy Impact The release of the report could reshape the U.S. crypto landscape and send ripple effects through global markets. While speculative attention focuses on dramatic initiatives like a bitcoin reserve, the true impact may come from how the U.S. integrates digital assets into legacy financial systems, and the degree to which legal and regulatory ambiguity is resolved.

However, the scale of his investments is considerable, as a new infographic from Cryptonews shows. Donald Trump’s personal crypto wealth has now already exceeded the $1.2 billion mark. According to the Democratic Caucus on the U.S. Congressional Financial Services Committee, Trump has systematically worked in recent months to weaken relevant regulatory authorities and stifle ongoing proceedings to build up crypto wealth secretly. According to a recent analysis, this wealth now even exceeds the total value of his real estate portfolio. As the infographic shows, Trump’s crypto wealth is spread across several asset classes and projects with a direct or indirect connection to his name. At the top is World Liberty Financial, a crypto company with close family ties, from which, according to research, Donald Trump is said to have siphoned around $390 million. This is followed by a $315 million meme coin, for which Trump licensed his name and profited from the price increase, as well as obfuscated wallets and investments valued at $430 million. He generated further income, among other things, from the sale of his own Trump NFTs. Trump’s attributed crypto wealth according to Forbes’ research. Source: Forbes . A central element of Trump’s crypto strategy is the aggressive positioning of his media company, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), as an institutional Bitcoin investor. As the infographic shows, the company now holds approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and Bitcoin-related securities—including physical holdings, options, and exchange-traded products. Notably, the remaining liquid assets amount to only around $1 billion, meaning that roughly two-thirds of the total liquidity reserve is tied up in crypto assets. Percentage of BTC and bitcoin-related securities (“Bitcoin”) in total liquidity of the Trump Media & Technology Group. Source: Trump Media & Technology Group ; With this strategy, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) is now one of the largest Bitcoin holders in the world. As the infographic shows, the company already ranks sixth among all publicly traded companies with Bitcoin holdings – ahead of well-known players like Tesla, Coinbase, and Galaxy Digital. Only companies like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Block (formerly Square) currently hold larger BTC reserves. This position among the top holders shows the importance Bitcoin has become for TMTG’s strategic financial management – and also highlights how closely intertwined Trump’s media empire is with the cryptocurrency industry. As the infographic shows, Trump Media & Technology Group’s (TMTG) Bitcoin holdings are not only large—they also represent a significant portion of the company’s overall valuation. Approximately 40% of TMTG’s current market capitalization is accounted for by BTC holdings, underscoring the company’s dependence on the Bitcoin price. Despite its massive Bitcoin holdings, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) shares have recently performed significantly weaker than the Bitcoin price itself. As the infographic shows, the stock’s performance is clearly lagging behind the crypto asset – both in the short term and over several months. Donald Trump’s family circle is also deeply involved in the crypto strategy. His sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, are among the co-founders of American Bitcoin. This company has already raised $220 million in institutional capital to finance Bitcoin reserves and mining infrastructure. At the same time, all three Trump sons are co-founders of World Liberty Financial, arguably the most central crypto vehicle in the Trump network; the US President operates there as “co-founder emeritus.” Eric Trump also recently commented publicly on Ethereum. On February 4, he described ETH as a buying opportunity and recently hinted that he sees the cryptocurrency’s fair value at $8,000. The neutrality of this Ethereum forecast can at least be questioned with regard to investments from the surrounding area. According to an analysis by the Washington Post, around 20% of current Trump advisors actively hold cryptocurrencies. This raises questions about the independence of political decision-making processes – especially at a time when crypto regulation and government Bitcoin initiatives are gaining increasing importance. The high proportion of investors in Trump’s immediate circle underscores the close personal and financial ties between politics and digital assets.

2025-07-30 12:10:15+00:00,Trump Tariff Deadline: A Crucial Economic Warning for Crypto Investors,"BitcoinWorld Trump Tariff Deadline: A Crucial Economic Warning for Crypto Investors The digital asset world often finds itself intertwined with global economic and political currents. A recent declaration from U.S. President Donald Trump has sent ripples through financial markets, and it’s crucial for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors to understand its potential implications. In a direct post on Truth Social, relayed by Walter Bloomberg on X, President Trump unequivocally stated that the August 1 deadline for ongoing trade negotiations ‘stands strong’ and will not be extended. He even characterized this firm stance as ‘a great day for America.’ But what does this decisive Trump Tariff Deadline mean for the broader economic landscape, and more specifically, for the often-unpredictable crypto market? Understanding the Trump Tariff Deadline Announcement President Trump’s latest announcement regarding the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline underscores his consistent ‘America First’ approach to trade policy. Historically, Trump’s administration has favored aggressive negotiation tactics, often employing tariffs as leverage to secure what he deems more favorable trade agreements. This particular deadline, though not explicitly detailing the specific negotiations it pertains to, signals a firm resolve to conclude or escalate ongoing trade discussions. Source of the News: The declaration was made by President Trump himself in a post on Truth Social, subsequently reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, a well-known source for rapid financial news updates. This direct communication method bypasses traditional media filters, giving the announcement immediate weight and authenticity from the President’s perspective. The Core Message: The unambiguous statement that the August 1st deadline ‘stands strong’ and ‘will not be extended’ leaves no room for speculation. It indicates a clear intention to push for a swift resolution or to proceed with consequences if demands are not met. President’s Stance: Labeling the decision as ‘a great day for America’ suggests a belief that this firm stance will ultimately benefit U.S. economic interests, potentially by securing better trade deals or protecting domestic industries. This sentiment often resonates with his political base and aligns with his broader economic philosophy. Immediate Implication: For businesses and markets, this means a period of heightened anticipation leading up to August 1st. Companies involved in international trade, particularly those with exposure to potential tariffs, will be scrambling to assess risks and adjust strategies. Historical Context: Past Trump Tariff Deadlines and Market Reactions To truly grasp the potential impact of this new Trump Tariff Deadline , it’s beneficial to look back at previous instances of President Trump’s trade-related pronouncements and their market reverberations. During his previous term, the U.S. engaged in significant trade disputes, most notably with China, but also with allies like the European Union and Canada over steel and aluminum tariffs. These periods were often characterized by a high degree of market uncertainty and volatility, as businesses and investors grappled with unpredictable policy shifts. Consider the U.S.-China trade war, which spanned several years. The imposition of tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods, from agricultural products to electronics, created immense pressure on global supply chains and corporate profitability. Each announcement, each deadline, and each negotiation round triggered significant reactions in stock markets, commodity prices, and currency valuations. While the cryptocurrency market was less mature during the peak of these trade wars, it did show interesting patterns. Bitcoin, in particular, sometimes saw spikes in demand as it was perceived by some as an uncorrelated asset or a ‘digital gold’ hedge against traditional financial instability. However, as the crypto market has matured and become more integrated with traditional finance, its correlation with equities has generally increased, meaning major downturns in traditional markets are more likely to drag crypto prices down. Potential Economic Ripple Effects of the Trump Tariff Deadline A hard deadline for trade negotiations, particularly one related to tariffs, carries significant weight for the global economy. If agreements aren’t reached by the August 1 Trump Tariff Deadline , several economic ripple effects could ensue, impacting various sectors and potentially leading to broader macroeconomic shifts: Supply Chain Disruptions: New or increased tariffs could force multinational corporations to urgently re-evaluate their sourcing and manufacturing locations.

2025-07-30 12:30:22+00:00,"Kraken releases latest Proof of Reserves, continuing our commitment to trust through transparency","At Kraken, transparency isn’t a slogan – it’s a standard. Our latest Proof of Reserves (PoR) audit , finalized as of June 30, 2025 , once again verifies that client assets held on our platform are backed 1:1 and beyond. The process covers major cryptoassets, including BTC, ETH, SOL, USDC, USDT, XRP and ADA . We don’t expect blind trust. We don’t need it. We offer cryptographic evidence. New to PoR? Learn how it works in our beginner’s guide . What our June 2025 report shows Our PoR audit captures a complete snapshot of client assets across all services – not just spot balances. It includes margin accounts, futures holdings and staked assets , offering a full-spectrum look at customer exposure. Reserve ratios as of June 30, 2025 A quick refresher – what is Proof of Reserves? Proof of Reserves is a cryptographic process that allows clients to verify, independently and privately, that their assets are included in a third-party-audited snapshot of the platform’s liabilities. We use a Merkle tree to combine individual balances into a single cryptographic hash. Clients receive a personalized Merkle proof , which they can use to confirm inclusion without revealing personal details. An independent auditor then confirms that Kraken’s onchain holdings exceed total client balances – effectively verifying full reserves without assumptions. Why Kraken’s PoR goes further While more exchanges are now offering “PoRs” in some form, not all of them offer the same level of rigor or transparency. Here’s what sets ours apart: 1. We account for liabilities, not just assets Some platforms show what they hold – but skip what they owe. We include total client liabilities in every audit. Anything less isn’t a full proof of reserves. 2. User-level verification Every client can verify their own inclusion using our open-source Merkle verification tool. This isn’t just about trust – it’s about verification. 3. A decade of consistency We first pioneered PoR in 2014 – and we haven’t stopped. Kraken conducts PoR regularly and methodically , not just during news cycles. PoR is vital. It’s not about promises. It’s about proof – visible, cryptographic, third-party-verified proof. Kraken’s process is built to withstand scrutiny and empower users with information. What’s next – expanding scope We’re committed to publishing PoRs quarterly , alongside our financial disclosures, to ensure users have a regular window into platform solvency. We’re also actively working to expand the coverage of our PoRs to include more supported assets , giving a broader view of the reserves across our ecosystem.

2025-07-30 12:30:44+00:00,"Ethereum Price Could Rise To $9,000 This Cycle, Eyes Breakout Against Bitcoin","Crypto analyst Lourenço has predicted that the Ethereum price could rally to $9,000 in this market cycle. This comes as ETH eyes a breakout against its BTC pair, which could spark a massive run for the crypto and other altcoins. Ethereum Price Eyes Rally To $9,000 This Cycle In an X post, Lourenço opined that the Ethereum price could rally to as high as $9,000 at some point in this market cycle. This came as he analyzed the weekly ETH chart. The analyst noted that, depending on how the trend on the upper side of the wedge is drawn, the altcoin may have already broken it with hard closes above. Related Reading: Ethereum Price To $20,000? ETH Is Mirroring Bitcoin’s Move From 2021 Lourenço declared that the $4,000 level is an important one and that once it flips into support, there will be additional resistance between $4,700 and $5,000. However, the analyst believes that the Ethereum price is ultimately set to go and tag between $8,000 and $9,000. He also indicated that the risk-return ratio on ETH is very hard to ignore at the moment. Crypto analyst Galaxy also echoed a similar bullish sentiment for the Ethereum price. In an X post, he said that there is a lot of potential upside for ETH on the BTC pair. The analyst noted that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is still bottomed and that, from his perspective, the trend is just beginning. His accompanying chart showed that the RSI isn’t in overbought levels despite the fact that the Ethereum price has rallied over 60% in the past month. Notably, ETH’s RSI had surged above 60 on previous highs, including when it reached its current ATH of $4,800 in 2021. The Key Is For ETH To Break Above $4,000 In an X post, crypto analyst Ted revealed that the key is for the Ethereum price to break above the $4,000 level. He noted that since the 2021 ATH, ETH hasn’t been able to reclaim the $4,000 level. However, if that happens this time around, he declared that the ETH pump will be “unstoppable.” Related Reading: Crypto Founder Reveals What Will Drive Ethereum Price To $10,000 His accompanying chart showed that the Ethereum price could rally to $5,200 in the short term. This will mark a new all-time high for the altcoin. Crypto analyst Merlijn also hammered on the $4,000 resistance. He noted that this has been the ceiling for ETH since 2021, and it has been rejected from this level seven times. However, the Ethereum price is again looking to break above this level. Merlijn remarked that this resistance isn’t just another resistance but the “gate to price discovery.” His accompanying chart showed that ETH could reach $11,000 between now and 2026 if it breaks this resistance level. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

2025-07-30 12:35:12+00:00,BTC Capital Rotation or Fresh Fund Inflows: What’s Really Fueling ETH’s Rally?,"The consensus in the crypto market is that the ongoing ether (ETH) rally, which has extended to other altcoins, is driven by capital rotation from bitcoin (BTC). However, on-chain data obtained by CryptoQuant has proven that the information is false. According to a report by CQ’s analyst Carmelo Aleman, fresh inflow from investors is driving the ETH rally, not capital rotation from bitcoin. Market participants are not selling BTC to buy ETH – the Bitcoin Realized Capitalization serves as evidence for this claim. What is Driving Ether’s Rally? This month, ETH has climbed over 60% from $2,400 to $3,850. On the other hand, BTC has increased by 14% from $107,000 to hit an all-time high (ATH) above $123,000. Although BTC declined briefly to the $115,000 zone, it has consolidated mostly between $117,000 and $120,000. As of July 25, bitcoin reached a new ATH in Realized Cap at $1.018 trillion. This metric represents the market cap of bitcoin by telling the price at which each BTC was last moved on-chain. Hence, it reflects the total acquisition cost of all BTC in circulation, factoring in accumulation trends and large-scale selling. The increase in Realized Cap indicates that the capital invested in bitcoin is rising, not declining. So, instead of dumping BTC for ETH and other altcoins, investors are allocating fresh capital to their other crypto holdings. No Major Capital Rotation Addressing bitcoin’s consolidation concerns, Aleman explained that such price pauses can be attributed to capital accumulation phases that come before exponential rallies. The market has witnessed such dynamics in past bull cycles; this time will be no different. “So, what’s happening with ETH? The answer is simple: following the Genesis Law, along with the strong growth prospects of the Ethereum ecosystem, there has been a surge in capital invested in ETH this July, but without reducing positions in BTC,” the analyst added. In conclusion, there is no major capital rotation from BTC to ETH. Investors are just injecting new capital through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other investment products. Institutional demand for ETH is currently at peak levels, with spot Ethereum ETF purchases accounting for more than the daily production of ether. Ethereum investment products just recorded their second-largest weekly inflow at $1.59 billion. Inflows into the products this year have exceeded the total recorded in all of 2023.

2025-07-30 12:35:21+00:00,"Federal Reserve Should Impose Tariff Inflation Exclusion, Cut Rates in July – Mulhem","The Federal Reserve has found itself under growing pressure from US President Donald Trump amid its reluctance to lower the federal funds rate due to concerns over the inflationary effects of tariffs. Last week, Trump visited the Fed and questioned Chairman Jerome Powell about over-budget renovations, while also reiterating calls for the FOMC to cut rates. A rate cut would directly benefit Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, in addition to other risk-on assets, such as equities, while also stimulating US economic activity. However, the market believes the Fed holding rates steady at the FOMC meeting on 30 July is near-certain, with there being just a 3.1% chance of a rate cut as per CME FedWatch and Polymarket giving similarly low odds for a July rate cut . Despite the market’s expectations, Suliman Mulhem, a financial analyst, believes a surprise 25bps cut this week is not completely off the table. “A surprise 25bps cut could be on the cards on 30 July if the Fed decides to accept tariff-induced price hikes as transitory, one-off increases,” Mulhem said. “As the US labour market is not especially tight at the moment and not a material source of inflationary pressure, tariffs are extremely unlikely to induce a wage-price spiral, so their effects are likely to be limited to a one-time price increase rather than recurring price creep.” Mulhem added that the low risk of a wage-price spiral and the fact that companies have low pricing power means the Fed should lower the federal funds rate this week. “The absence of a wage-price spiral, coupled with firms currently having relatively low pricing power and therefore opting to work the majority of the tariffs into their margin rather than hiking prices for consumers, means it would be prudent for the FOMC to make monetary policy decisions with an exclusion on tariff-related inflation and therefore begin cutting the federal funds rate in July.” He also warned that although headline jobs data looks encouraging, some cracks are already beginning to show beneath the surface. “As for the other side of the Fed’s dual mandate, although the unemployment rate has remained close to four percent and the labour market looks robust, non-healthcare private sector job creation has slowed to virtually zero and further cracks could soon begin to show, potentially prompting a jumbo 50bps cut at the September FOMC meeting if the Fed opts to keep rates unchanged on Wednesday.” Bitcoin has been trading in the $116,000-$120,000 range in recent weeks, as the market awaits a new catalyst for a directional breakout. A surprise cut on 30 July could provide Bitcoin with fresh momentum to decisively break above $120,000 and enter a new phase of price discovery.

2025-07-30 12:45:11+00:00,US-India Tariffs: Trump’s Bold Move to Impose 25% on Indian Imports and Its Global Ripple Effect,"BitcoinWorld US-India Tariffs: Trump’s Bold Move to Impose 25% on Indian Imports and Its Global Ripple Effect In the intricate dance of global economics, even a whisper of trade policy changes can send ripples across markets. For those closely watching the ebb and flow of traditional finance and the burgeoning cryptocurrency space, understanding these shifts is paramount. A recent announcement, initially shared by Walter Bloomberg on X, indicates that former U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose a significant 25% tariff on goods imported from India if he returns to office. This potential move concerning US-India tariffs isn’t just a headline; it’s a potential game-changer that could redefine trade relations, impact global supply chains, and even subtly influence the volatility and appeal of digital assets. What Exactly Are These Proposed US-India Tariffs and Why Now? At its core, a tariff is a tax imposed by one country on goods and services imported from another country. They are typically used to protect domestic industries, generate revenue, or exert political pressure. The proposed US-India tariffs , specifically a 25% levy on Indian imports, would significantly increase the cost of Indian goods entering the U.S. market. While the announcement comes from a potential future administration, it echoes a consistent theme from Donald Trump’s previous presidency: a strong belief in using tariffs as a tool to address perceived trade imbalances and encourage domestic production. During his first term, the U.S. implemented tariffs on various goods from China and other nations, aiming to renegotiate trade agreements that he deemed unfair to American workers and businesses. This latest proposal targeting India aligns with that protectionist philosophy. The 25% figure is substantial. For context, even small tariff increases can significantly alter the competitiveness of imported goods. A quarter of the import value added as a tax could make many Indian products prohibitively expensive for American consumers and businesses, potentially forcing them to seek alternatives or absorb higher costs. This move is less about generating revenue and more about strategic leverage, signaling a potential shift in the economic relationship between two of the world’s largest democracies. How Will These US-India Tariffs Reshape Global Supply Chains? The immediate and most tangible impact of such substantial US-India tariffs would be felt across various sectors and supply chains. India is a significant exporter of diverse goods to the U.S., including: Pharmaceuticals: India is a major global supplier of generic drugs. Higher tariffs could increase drug prices for American consumers. Textiles and Apparel: Indian textiles are competitive in the U.S. market. A 25% tariff would make them considerably more expensive, potentially benefiting other textile-producing nations or domestic U.S. manufacturers. Information Technology Services: While less about physical goods, trade policies can influence the flow of services and talent. Gems and Jewelry: India is a hub for diamond polishing and jewelry manufacturing. Agricultural Products: Certain Indian agricultural exports could face hurdles. For Indian exporters, a 25% tariff would mean a drastic reduction in their competitiveness in the U.S. market. They would either have to absorb the cost, reduce their profit margins, or find alternative markets. This could lead to job losses in India and a slowdown in its export-driven growth. On the U.S. side, importers and consumers would face higher prices for goods that previously came from India. While the stated goal is to boost domestic production, the transition isn’t seamless. Businesses would need to find new suppliers, either domestically or from other countries, which can be costly and time-consuming. This could lead to: Increased Consumer Prices: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers. Supply Chain Disruptions: Companies relying on Indian components or finished goods would need to reconfigure their sourcing. Reduced Product Variety: If certain Indian goods become too expensive, they might disappear from U.S. shelves. Ultimately, these tariffs could force a significant reconfiguration of global supply chains, pushing companies to diversify their sourcing away from India or to bring production back to the U.S., a process known as ‘reshoring’ or ‘nearshoring’. Are US-India Tariffs a Threat or an Opportunity for the Global Economy? The imposition of significant US-India tariffs presents a complex scenario with both challenges and potential, albeit limited, opportunities. Challenges: Aspect Impact Inflationary Pressures Increased costs for imported goods can lead to higher prices for consumers in the U.S. Reduced Economic Growth Trade barriers can stifle global trade, leading to slower economic expansion for both nations and potentially globally.

Ultimately, these tariffs could force a significant reconfiguration of global supply chains, pushing companies to diversify their sourcing away from India or to bring production back to the U.S., a process known as ‘reshoring’ or ‘nearshoring’. Are US-India Tariffs a Threat or an Opportunity for the Global Economy? The imposition of significant US-India tariffs presents a complex scenario with both challenges and potential, albeit limited, opportunities. Challenges: Aspect Impact Inflationary Pressures Increased costs for imported goods can lead to higher prices for consumers in the U.S. Reduced Economic Growth Trade barriers can stifle global trade, leading to slower economic expansion for both nations and potentially globally. Retaliatory Measures India might impose its own tariffs on U.S. goods, escalating in"

2025-07-30 12:54:02+00:00,Will XRP Be the Next Altcoin to Break Out? SIX MINING Launches XRP Cloud Mining Contracts to Help Users Earn Stable Profits,"XRP has been gaining momentum recently as US lawmakers advance major cryptocurrency legislation, including the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act , which are expected to provide much-needed regulatory clarity to the digital asset sector. XRP has seen strong recent momentum, reaching an all-time high of $3.50 on July 22nd. Institutional demand is supporting XRP’s bullish outlook, driving continued expansion in both spot and derivatives markets. Finding the best cryptocurrencies to buy these days can be like finding a needle in a haystack, but some altcoins consistently stand out – like XRP, which has captured attention with its strong community, exciting developments, and significant buzz.

Immediately after the news went out, US President Donald Trump reiterated his stance that the Federal Reserve needs to lower the interest rates as soon as today. Perhaps in an attempt to prepare for Trump’s tariffs against multiple key partners, businesses piled up in Q1 this year, which resulted in less economic expansion. The difference in Q2 is quite evident, given the aforementioned 3% increase, as many of those entities scaled back on imports. According to CNN, most experts anticipated a more modest 2% growth. Consequently, the gross domestic product’s (GDP) rise in Q2 of 3% helps Trump’s agenda to push for an interest rate cut after the -0.5% correction observed in the first quarter of 2025, which was the first decline in three years. TRUMP: 2Q GDP JUST OUT, WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) July 30, 2025 The POTUS was quick to praise the development, and used it as an opportunity to pressure Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut the rates as he has done multiple times in the past. In fact, in one of those reiterations, Trump urged the most significant rate cut in the history of 3 basis points. BTC’s price follows the macro developments in the world’s largest economy, and its movements are tightly correlated to the nation’s interest rate policy. Still being considered a riskier asset, it tends to benefit from an environment with lower rates. This hasn’t stopped it from thriving for the past year or so. However, it has stalled below the most recent all-time high of over $123,000, charted a couple of weeks ago, and many experts believe a potential rate cut could lead to further gains. However, the chances of this happening later today during the FOMC meeting are very slim.

2025-07-30 13:00:12+00:00,Bitcoin’s Massive Unrealized Profits: A $1.4 Trillion Milestone & Market Implications,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Massive Unrealized Profits: A $1.4 Trillion Milestone & Market Implications The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a monumental development: Bitcoin unrealized profits have soared to an unprecedented $1.4 trillion. This staggering figure, reported by Glassnode, marks a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s journey, reflecting immense wealth accumulation for holders. But what exactly does this colossal sum signify for the market, and could this prosperity bring its own set of challenges? Understanding Bitcoin Unrealized Profits: A Closer Look Before diving into the implications of this massive sum, let’s clarify what Bitcoin unrealized profits actually mean. Simply put, it’s the theoretical gain that Bitcoin holders would realize if they sold their holdings at the current market price, but haven’t yet. It’s the difference between the price at which they acquired their Bitcoin and its current market value. Realized vs. Unrealized: Unlike realized profits, which are locked in after a sale, unrealized profits are still subject to market fluctuations. They can grow or shrink with Bitcoin’s price movements. Market Indicator: This metric serves as a crucial indicator of market sentiment and potential future selling pressure. When unrealized profits are high, it suggests a large portion of the supply is “in profit,” which can tempt holders to sell. Historical Context: Throughout Bitcoin’s history, periods of exceptionally high unrealized profits have often preceded significant market corrections, as profit-taking behavior increases. The Glassnode Revelation: A Trillion-Dollar Milestone for BTC Holders The renowned on-chain analytics firm Glassnode recently shared a groundbreaking insight on X, revealing that the aggregate Bitcoin unrealized profits for all holders have skyrocketed to an astonishing $1.4 trillion. This isn’t just a big number; it’s a new all-time high, surpassing previous peaks seen in prior bull markets. This achievement underscores the incredible wealth creation Bitcoin has facilitated for its long-term believers and recent entrants alike. This data point is particularly compelling because it provides a macro view of the market’s profitability. It tells us that a vast majority of Bitcoin in circulation is currently held at a profit, indicating strong conviction among holders who have weathered market volatility to reach this point. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and its ability to generate substantial returns over time. The Dual Edge of Prosperity: Why High Unrealized Profits Matter While a record $1.4 trillion in Bitcoin unrealized profits sounds unequivocally positive, it presents a fascinating paradox for the market. On one hand, it signifies immense wealth creation and validates Bitcoin’s investment thesis. On the other, it introduces a significant dynamic: increased selling pressure. Here’s why this dual edge is so critical: Temptation to Realize Gains: As prices continue to climb, the incentive for holders to “cash out” some of their profits grows. This is a natural human behavior, especially after experiencing significant paper gains. Supply Shock vs. Profit-Taking: While Bitcoin’s supply is inherently limited, the availability of that supply for sale can increase dramatically when a large portion of it is in profit. This could potentially offset some of the demand-side pressures. Historical Precedent: Past market cycles have shown that when a large percentage of the circulating supply moves into an unrealized profit state, it often precedes periods of increased volatility and, sometimes, corrections as long-term holders distribute their holdings. The challenge for the market now is to absorb this potential selling pressure without triggering a sharp downturn. It highlights the delicate balance between investor exuberance and prudent profit-taking. Who Holds the Keys to These Profits? Understanding Different Holder Behaviors When we talk about $1.4 trillion in Bitcoin unrealized profits , it’s not a monolithic group. Bitcoin holders can generally be categorized, and their behavior significantly impacts market dynamics: Holder Type Characteristics Likely Behavior with High Unrealized Profits Long-Term Holders (LTHs) Hold Bitcoin for over 155 days, often accumulated during bear markets or early stages. More resilient, less likely to sell on minor price dips. May strategically distribute portions during parabolic rallies. Their cost basis is typically very low. Short-Term Holders (STHs) Hold Bitcoin for less than 155 days, often new entrants or traders. More sensitive to price movements, quicker to realize profits or cut losses. Their cost basis is closer to current market prices, making them more prone to selling when profits emerge. Glassnode’s data often provides insights into which cohorts are holding the most unrealized gains. Currently, both long-term and short-term holders are sitting on significant profits, contributing to the overall $1.4 trillion figur",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-unrealized-profits-milestone/,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,Crypto News|#Glassnode|BITCOIN|btc price|Crypto Market|Profit-taking,BTC,"Bitcoin’s Massive Unrealized Profits: A $1.4 Trillion Milestone & Market Implications.

2025-07-30 13:00:17+00:00,Solana Fund Projections: Spot ETFs Could Draw Multi‑Billion Inflows In First Year Following Approval,"Given the notable success of the Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs, there has been significant pressure from crypto leaders and asset management companies toward a Solana Spot ETF . Many believe that a SOL spot ETF is reasonable and could attract a similar success due to the fact that Solana is the most actively used network in the sector. Billions To Be Unlocked By Solana ETFs Solana may be ready for a dramatic change in institutional acceptance, as analysts forecast that SOL Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) could attract billions of dollars, akin to Bitcoin and Ethereum, once it is introduced. The latest projections concerning the SOL ETF introduction came from SolanaFloor. According to the platform, the SOL spot ETF is likely to draw in about inflows in the first year following its inception in the crypto market. In the report, the platform drew attention to the remarkable growth and success of the Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs , which have witnessed exponential capital inflow so far. Being the most performant and actively used network, SolanaFloor believes that SOL would experience a comparable performance and inflows. After a thorough analysis, the experts stated that a whopping $5.52 billion in inflows might be recorded within the first year. It is important to note that the forecast for the fund aligns with some of the world’s top financial firms, such as JPMorgan, which predicted in January this year that SOL ETFs may see inflows ranging from $2.7 to $5.2 billion. With this projection, a Solana ETF, if authorized, would be a big step in establishing the asset as a legitimate investment instrument. This would trigger massive interest from retail and institutional investors who are eager to gain exposure to crypto assets through regulated methods. The network has undergone significant development to become the epitome of blockchain use, and several asset managers are starting to recognize this shift. VanEck, a leading asset management firm, filed for the first SOL ETF in July 2024, with approvals now looking guaranteed. Furthermore, issuers such as Franklin Templeton and Fidelity are eager to have the official approval as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested that all issuers submit amended filings by July 31st, with a final deadline of October 10, 2025. SOL ETFs To Outperform Ethereum ETFs? Since their inception, Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have revolutionized crypto investments. ETH’s introduction into conventional markets has contributed to the establishment of a standard by which future cryptocurrency ETF performance can be evaluated. However, SolanaFloor believes that SOL ETFs could outperform Ethereum ETFs despite their remarkable performance so far. “Bearing Solana’s considerable momentum in mind, one can reasonably expect that SOL ETFs could witness greater demand and inflows than Ethereum, without dethroning Bitcoin itself,” the platform stated. At launch, the platform claims that SOL ETFs will draw inflows of $2.9 billion, considering its current price level. Meanwhile, a $400 SOL could see ETF AUM rise to $11.6 billion within a year of debut under ideal market circumstances.",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-fund-projections/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA|GALA|BTG|MATIC,Solana|AUM|Bitcoin Spot ETFs|Ethereum Spot ETFs|Fidelity|Franklin Templeton|JPMorgan|SOL|SOL price|solana|Solana ETFs|Solana news|Solana price|SolanaFloor|solusd|SOLUSDT|Spot Solana ETF|Spot Solana ETFs|US SEC|vaneck,BTC,"Solana Fund Projections: Spot ETFs Could Draw Multi‑Billion Inflows In First Year Following Approval.

After a thorough analysis, the experts stated that a whopping $5.52 billion in inflows might be recorded within the first year. It is important to note that the forecast for the fund aligns with some of the world’s top financial firms, such as JPMorgan, which predicted in January this year that SOL ETFs may see inflows ranging from $2.7 to $5.2 billion. With this projection, a Solana ETF, if authorized, would be a big step in establishing the asset as a legitimate investment instrument. This would trigger massive interest from retail and institutional investors who are eager to gain exposure to crypto assets through regulated methods. The network has undergone significant development to become the epitome of blockchain use, and several asset managers are starting to recognize this shift. VanEck, a leading asset management firm, filed for the first SOL ETF in July 2024, with approvals now looking guaranteed. Furthermore, issuers such as Franklin Templeton and Fidelity are eager to have the official approval as quickly as possible. In the meantime, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has requested that all issuers submit amended filings by July 31st, with a final deadline of October 10, 2025. SOL ETFs To Outperform Ethereum ETFs? Since their inception, Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs have revolutionized crypto investments. ETH’s introduction into conventional markets has contributed to the establishment of a standard by which future cryptocurrency ETF performance can be evaluated. However, SolanaFloor believes that SOL ETFs could outperform Ethereum ETFs despite their remarkable performance so far. “Bearing Solana’s considerable momentum in mind, one can reasonably expect that SOL ETFs could witness greater demand and inflows than Ethereum, without dethroning Bitcoin itself,” the platform stated. At launch, the platform claims that SOL ETFs will draw inflows of $2.9 billion, considering its current price level. Meanwhile, a $400 SOL could see ETF AUM rise to $11.6 billion within a year of debut under ideal market circumstances."

2025-07-30 13:03:01+00:00,Expert says Bitcoin is ‘the very definition of this financial bubble’,"Economist Henrik Zeberg has raised the alarm on Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the broader crypto market , calling it the clearest example of a financial bubble in today’s economy. According to Zeberg, the speculative frenzy surrounding cryptocurrencies mirrors historical manias driven by breakthrough technologies such as the steam engine and the Dot-com boom , he said in an X post on July 30. Zeberg pointed to a key macroeconomic indicator, the Market Cap to GDP ratio, which currently stands at 213% or 226% when cryptocurrencies are included. “Just like in all Bubbles, new Technology is the driver of the speculation. This time around, the easy-money polices since 2008 has further fueled the mania,” Zeberg said. He argued that this level signals a severe overvaluation, comparable to previous economic bubbles that ended in sharp collapses. Interestingly, the expert does not believe the bubble is driven by the technology itself, which he acknowledges as revolutionary, but by irrational market exuberance. In this case, he noted that past tech booms ended in crashes despite their long-term significance. Bitcoin ‘technically overvalued’ While Zeberg is not calling a market top just yet, he warned that Bitcoin appears technically vulnerable at current levels. Indeed, the insights come as Bitcoin trades just below the $120,000 mark after retracing from the all-time high of above $123,000. His chart analysis, which outlines a broadening diagonal pattern, projects a potential local top followed by a major decline. Momentum indicators such as the Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) also point to weakening strength on both weekly and monthly timeframes, suggesting the formation of a multi-year top.

2025-07-30 13:05:10+00:00,U.S. GDP Surges 3.0% in Q2: A Remarkable Economic Rebound,"BitcoinWorld U.S. GDP Surges 3.0% in Q2: A Remarkable Economic Rebound In the dynamic world of finance, where every economic indicator can send ripples across global markets, a recent announcement has truly captured attention. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, understanding the broader economic landscape is crucial. That’s why the latest report on U.S. GDP growth isn’t just a dry statistic; it’s a powerful signal that could influence everything from interest rates to the very value of your digital assets. So, let’s dive into the details of this significant economic development and what it means for you. U.S. GDP Takes Center Stage: Decoding the Q2 Surprise The United States economy has delivered a pleasant surprise, showcasing impressive resilience and growth. According to data released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annual rate of 3.0% in the second quarter of 2025. This figure didn’t just meet expectations; it significantly outpaced them, soaring past the 2.5% gain economists had broadly anticipated. This robust performance marks a sharp and welcome rebound from the 0.5% contraction experienced in the prior quarter, signaling a strong shift in economic momentum. What exactly is GDP, and why is this number so important? Simply put, GDP represents the total monetary value of all finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific time period. It’s often considered the broadest measure of economic activity and a key indicator of the economy’s health. A higher GDP generally indicates a more robust and growing economy, which can have far-reaching implications. What Drove This Impressive U.S. GDP Performance? When an economy demonstrates such strong growth, it’s natural to wonder about the underlying forces at play. While the advance estimate doesn’t provide granular detail on every component, economists typically look to several key drivers that contribute to GDP expansion: Robust Consumer Spending: Often the largest component of GDP, strong consumer confidence and increased spending on goods and services can significantly boost economic output. People feeling secure in their jobs and finances tend to spend more. Increased Business Investment: When businesses are optimistic about future demand, they invest in new equipment, technology, and expansion. This capital expenditure signals confidence in the economy’s trajectory. Government Spending: Government expenditures on infrastructure, defense, and social programs can also provide a direct boost to economic activity. Net Exports: The difference between a country’s exports and imports. While often volatile, a strong global demand for U.S. goods and services can contribute positively to GDP. The sharp rebound suggests that many of these engines were firing on all cylinders, collectively pushing the U.S. GDP back into positive and strong territory after a challenging first quarter. The GDP Price Index: A Closer Look at Inflationary Pressures Beyond the headline GDP growth figure, another crucial piece of information was released: the GDP price index. This index, which measures the prices of goods and services produced domestically, rose 2.0% in Q2. This figure came in below forecasts of 2.2% and marked a notable decrease from the 3.8% increase observed in Q1. Why is the GDP price index important? It provides insights into inflationary pressures within the economy. A lower-than-expected increase suggests that while the economy is growing, it’s doing so without significantly accelerating inflation. This could be a reassuring sign for policymakers, particularly the Federal Reserve, who are tasked with managing both economic growth and price stability. A cooling of price increases could potentially alleviate some pressure for aggressive interest rate hikes, which has significant implications for borrowing costs and market liquidity, including for crypto assets. U.S. GDP and the Broader Economic Landscape: Ripple Effects A healthy U.S. GDP has widespread implications that extend far beyond financial headlines. Here’s how this strong economic performance could ripple through various sectors: Employment: Sustained economic growth often translates into job creation. Businesses expand, requiring more labor, which can lead to lower unemployment rates and potentially higher wages for workers. Corporate Earnings: Strong economic activity generally boosts company revenues and profits. This can be positive for stock market performance, as investors anticipate better returns from corporations. Interest Rates: While strong growth might normally signal potential interest rate hikes to curb inflation, the contained GDP price index might give the Federal Reserve more flexibility.

This PayPal development is being hailed as a game-changer by the XRP community, which sees it as a major step toward mainstream adoption and utility for the digital asset. Notably, the integration of XRP into PayPal’s vast payments ecosystem is particularly significant given the platform’s reach over 400 million active accounts and millions of merchants worldwide. XRP, known for its fast settlement speeds and low transaction costs, is ideally suited for real-world payments, but limited retail integration has held back its utility narrative. This move now positions XRP alongside other top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in one of the world’s most widely used digital payment networks. Merchants will be able to accept XRP seamlessly at checkout, while customers can spend their crypto holdings directly without converting to fiat first. This lowers barriers to usage, improves crypto liquidity, and makes XRP more practical for daily transactions. This PayPal feature also supports automatic fiat conversion on the backend. That means merchants can receive their funds in local currency, eliminating the volatility concerns often associated with accepting crypto. For XRP holders, this removes the friction of off-ramping and opens up a new world of usability, especially as e-commerce adoption of crypto accelerates. This PayPal announcement comes at a time when regulatory clarity around cryptocurrencies is set to get a boost since a key White House Crypto Policy is set to go live today. Market analysts note that expanding real-world utility is a key driver for long-term price appreciation.

2025-07-30 13:10:11+00:00,Fed Rate Cut: Trump’s Urgent Call After Stellar Q2 GDP Boosts Economy,"BitcoinWorld Fed Rate Cut: Trump’s Urgent Call After Stellar Q2 GDP Boosts Economy In a move that sent ripples through financial markets and political circles alike, former U.S. President Donald Trump recently took to Truth Social, declaring the Q2 GDP report as ‘way better than expected.’ This robust economic performance immediately fueled his call for the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to implement an immediate Fed rate cut . The news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, highlights a persistent tension between political desires for economic stimulation and the Fed’s mandate for price stability and maximum employment. For anyone tracking the pulse of the global economy, especially those with a keen eye on cryptocurrencies, understanding the implications of a potential Fed rate cut is crucial. What Sparked the Call for an Immediate Fed Rate Cut ? The catalyst for Trump’s bold statement was the surprisingly strong Q2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report. GDP, a key indicator of economic health, measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country. A ‘better than expected’ reading typically signals robust economic activity, often leading to optimism about future growth. Trump’s argument is straightforward: if the economy is already performing well, lower interest rates would provide an even greater boost, making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, and theoretically accelerating job creation and investment. Strong Economic Data: The Q2 GDP figures likely surpassed analyst forecasts, indicating underlying economic strength despite ongoing global uncertainties. Trump’s Consistent Stance: Throughout his presidency and beyond, Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Fed’s interest rate policies, consistently advocating for lower rates to stimulate growth and reduce the national debt’s servicing costs. Public Platform: Using Truth Social, his preferred communication channel, allowed him to directly address his base and the broader public, amplifying his message for an immediate Fed rate cut . This public pressure on the independent central bank is not new, but it underscores the political weight often placed on monetary policy decisions. The debate centers on whether the Fed should react to strong growth by easing policy, or maintain a tighter stance to guard against inflation. The Federal Reserve’s Balancing Act: Inflation, Growth, and a Potential Fed Rate Cut The Federal Reserve operates under a dual mandate from Congress: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (i.e., control inflation). This delicate balancing act often puts the Fed in a challenging position, especially when economic signals are mixed or political pressures mount. While strong GDP indicates growth and potentially full employment, the Fed must also consider inflationary pressures. Currently, the Fed has been on a path of raising or holding interest rates steady to combat persistent inflation that surged in recent years.

BitcoinWorld Fed Rate Cut: Trump’s Urgent Call After Stellar Q2 GDP Boosts Economy In a move that sent ripples through financial markets and political circles alike, former U.S. President Donald Trump recently took to Truth Social, declaring the Q2 GDP report as ‘way better than expected.’ This robust economic performance immediately fueled his call for the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) to implement an immediate Fed rate cut . The news, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, highlights a persistent tension between political desires for economic stimulation and the Fed’s mandate for price stability and maximum employment. For anyone tracking the pulse of the global economy, especially those with a keen eye on cryptocurrencies, understanding the implications of a potential Fed rate cut is crucial. What Sparked the Call for an Immediate Fed Rate Cut ? The catalyst for Trump’s bold statement was the surprisingly strong Q2 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report. GDP, a key indicator of economic health, measures the total value of goods and services produced in a country. A ‘better than expected’ reading typically signals robust economic activity, often leading to optimism about future growth. Trump’s argument is straightforward: if the economy is already performing well, lower interest rates would provide an even greater boost, making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers, and theoretically accelerating job creation and investment. Strong Economic Data: The Q2 GDP figures likely surpassed analyst forecasts, indicating underlying economic strength despite ongoing global uncertainties. Trump’s Consistent Stance: Throughout his presidency and beyond, Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of the Fed’s interest rate policies, consistently advocating for lower rates to stimulate growth and reduce the national debt’s servicing costs. Public Platform: Using Truth Social, his preferred communication channel, allowed him to directly address his base and the broader public, amplifying his message for an immediate Fed rate cut . This public pressure on the independent central bank is not new, but it underscores the political weight often placed on monetary policy decisions. The debate centers on whether the Fed should react to strong growth by easing policy, or maintain a tighter stance to guard against inflation. The Federal Reserve’s Balancing Act: Inflation, Growth, and a Potential Fed Rate Cut The Federal Reserve operates under a dual mandate from Congress: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (i.e., control inflation). This delicate balancing act often puts the Fed in a challenging position, especially when economic signals are mixed or political pressures mount. While strong GDP indicates growth and potentially full employment, the Fed must also consider inflationary pressures. Currently, the Fed has been on a path of raising or holding interest rates steady to combat persistent inflation that surged in recent years. A Fed rate cut would reverse this trend, making money cheaper to borrow and potentially stimulating demand. However, this could also risk reigniting inflationary pressures, undoing the progress made in stabilizing prices. The Fed typically relies on a broad range of economic indicators, including inflation rates, employment figures, wage growth, and consumer spending, rather than just one GDP report, to make its decisions. Key Considerations for the Fed: Inflation Trajectory: Is inflation truly under control and on a sustainable path back to the Fed’s 2% target? A premature Fed rate cut could send it soaring again.

2025-07-30 13:17:24+00:00,"Bitcoin Liquidity Was Tested, But Investor Supermajority Stays in Profit","Bitcoin (BTC)’s liquidity faced “a significant test” over the past weekend, following the exit of a Satoshi-era whale. However, the market has remained resilient, according to the latest report by blockchain data platform Glassnode , with “a supermajority of investors” still holding unrealized profits. The analysts turned to the metric called the Realized Cap, which quantified the total USD-denominated liquidity within the Bitcoin network. At the time of the report, it stood at over $1.02 trillion. This amount, they note, highlights “the asset’s immense and growing liquidity profile and market depth.” Notably, this liquidity was tested over the weekend. An early Bitcoin investor distributed a whopping 80,000 BTC ($9.6 billion) in batches through Galaxy Digital , likely through market sales and OTC transactions. However, the market “efficiently absorbed” this sell-side event, which Glassnode describes as “one of the largest discrete profit-taking events in its history” and “the single largest sell-side pressure event in Bitcoin’s history, an immense liquidity stress test.” Source: Glassnode Moreover, the event caused a major spike in the Net Realized Profit/Loss metric, which hit an ATH of $3.7 billion. The spike “preceded the weekend sell-off and reflected the movement of coins in advance of the final distribution.” Meanwhile, the Bitcoin market has “remained remarkably stable,” even with the sell-side pressure and profit-taking by long-term investors. Therefore, a “supermajority” of investors still hold their BTC “at a meaningful unrealized profit, with over 97% of the circulating supply still held, despite spot prices trading above their original acquisition price.” Unrealized profits, or the total dollar value of paper gains across all market participants, recently hit an ATH of its own of $1.4 trillion in aggregate. These metrics underscore “how the majority of investors are sitting on substantial paper gains, and set up an environment of potential future sell-side pressure should prices continue to rise further”, the report notes.

Since its genesis block in July 2015, Ethereum has evolved from a novel smart contract platform into the backbone of decentralized finance, NFTs, DAOs, and a new generation of internet infrastructure.

Bitcoin May Move to $141,000 if It Breaks Above Current Range The resulting sell-side pressure from the whale’s exit pushed the price down to $115,000. It then stabilized at $119,000, just below the latest all-time high, despite the scale of the transaction. “This episode illustrates Bitcoin’s ability to absorb large sell-side volumes, even during typically thinner weekend trading hours, reinforcing the market’s structural robustness,” the report argues. Meanwhile, BTC currently trades at $118,363. It’s unchanged in a day and in a week. It’s up 10% in a month and 77% in a year. BTC hit its ATH of $122,838 on 14 July, decreasing 3.7% since. Per several on-chain valuation models, Bitcoin remains range-bound between $105,000 and $125,000. A decisive breakout above this range could “shift market dynamics” and make way for a move toward $141,000. The latter is an area where “profit-taking could sharply intensify.” It’s likely to see increased sell-side pressure due to the high unrealized profit expected there. On the other hand, “a light volume zone sits just below the current price between $110,000-$115,000.” This is “a critical area to monitor should a market pullback occur.” Meanwhile, the Long-Term Holder Net Realized Profit/Loss jumped to a new ATH of $2.5 billion, compared to the previous high of $1.6 billion.

There’s an initial phase of accumulation, followed by a sharp pivot into aggressive distribution, they write. The distribution phase is underway, and the LTH/STH supply ratio continues to contract.

Announces Expectations for the Altcoin Season!","Recently, altcoins have experienced significant volatility, led by Ethereum (ETH). As ETH approaches the critical threshold of $4,000, altcoins have also seen significant gains. While there was a cooling period in the market after this rapid rise, Swiss cryptocurrency bank Sygnum Bank said that the altcoin season may be near. According to Cointelegraph, Sygnum Bank said in its recently published Q3 2025 Investment Outlook Report that improved regulatory clarity, increased liquidity, and rising on-chain activity could trigger a long-awaited altcoin season. Analysts emphasized that previous cryptocurrency bull cycles followed a predictable pattern, with Bitcoin leading the way, followed by altcoins later in the cycle. They noted that this pattern has changed in the current cycle, noting that this cycle is no longer following this pattern due to changes in market structure and a lack of user interest, and is more focused on BTC. The approval of Bitcoin ETFs during this cycle has caused Bitcoin''s dominance to rise to levels not seen in recent years. This, according to analysts, has further overshadowed altcoins. However, analysts noted that the recent decline in BTC dominance suggests the long-awaited altcoin season may be upon us. They also added that investment in altcoins could increase as cryptocurrency regulations become clearer. Referring specifically to the recent surge in institutional demand for Ethereum, Sygnum analysts said that ETH has definitively broken its long-term downtrend and completely escaped the prolonged bear market. Analysts recently noted that while indices are still far from signaling an altcoin season, the decline in Bitcoin''s dominance has bolstered hopes for an altcoin season. Sygnum also added that the altcoin season will be slower and much quieter than previous cycles. The shift from Bitcoin to altcoins was a hallmark of past crypto bull cycles and was widely expected in the current cycle as well. However, unusually strong Bitcoin drivers and changes in market structure, where traditional financial institutions play a much larger role, have delayed the altcoin season and will likely keep it much quieter than in past cycles. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-30 13:30:00+00:00,NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF Utilizes A Call Option Strategy To Generate Double Digit Yields,"Summary BTCI offers a unique way to generate high monthly income from Bitcoin''s volatility, with a current annualized yield exceeding 25%. The ETF uses a synthetic covered call strategy, trading off some BTC upside for immediate income, making it ideal for income-focused investors. BTCI has delivered a 54% total return since inception, combining strong income with capital appreciation, though it underperforms pure BTC exposure. Given BTCI''s track record and a pro-crypto environment, I am bullish and plan to add it to my income-focused portfolios for future upside. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has proven many skeptics wrong over the past several years as it increased by 75.73% over the past year to $117,366. BTC is perceived as a store of value by many investors and despite large fluctuations in its share price it’s become an incredible investment opportunity that’s changed lives. BTC doesn’t generate income as it’s a decentralized digital currency which operates on a peer-to-peer network where the public transactions are recorded on the blockchain. NEOS Investments has created the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF ( BTCI ) for investors looking to generate large amounts of monthly income with exposure to BTC through exchange traded products that also provide the potential for capital appreciation when BTC appreciates. Some will say to just own BTC instead, but those investors are probably focused on capital appreciation rather than generating recurring income. BTCI is up 7% YTD and has delivered $9.98 of distribution income in 2025 which is a 16.90% yield on cost for anyone who started a position at the beginning of the year. BTCI has close to $500 million in assets under management (AUM) and after almost 1-year of being public its established a strong track record of income generation. I am bullish on several of the NEOS Investments ETF’s and the BTCI is going to be the 3 rd ETF from them that I allocate capital toward. BTCI is on track to deliver an annualized yield of roughly 27% and if BTC continues to appreciate I think BTCI will be in a position to not only appreciate in value but generate larger amounts of income in the future. Seeking Alpha Risks to investing in the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF While BTCI has an expected distribution rate that exceeds 25% there are significant risk factors that investors should consider. Everyone should do their own due diligence on BTCI before allocating capital toward it and not let the distribution yield blindly entice them. BTCI will invest at least 80% of its net assets in Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Products or options on Bitcoin Futures ETFs. BTCI’s share price will follow the direction of BTC which has been known to be extremely volatile over time. Investors could experience large price swings that result in capital depreciation. BTCI will utilize an option overlay strategy where they sell options to generate immediate income. If BTC continues to rally the options which are sold will likely limit BTCI’s upside potential causing it to underperform BTC and generate less capital appreciation. If for some reason BTC becomes less volatile in the future the premiums in the option market could change and BTCI may not be able to generate similar amounts of income as it currently does. BTCI is correlated to BTC and if for some reason BTC declines in value there is no risk mitigation through diversification or option strategies to soften the blow. Before allocating capital toward BTCI investors should understand that BTCI is focused on generating income and it will not track BTC on a 1:1 basis. Anyone interested in BTCI should conduct their own due diligence and understand that income is the primary focus of BTCI. How the NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF is structured BTCI is an actively managed ETF that is focused on generating recurring income as its primary goal with a secondary objective of potentially producing capital appreciation. BTCI will invest in exchange-traded spot Bitcoin ETPs predominantly through a controlled foreign corporation while they will still have the ability to invest directly into Bitcoin ETPs. BTCI will obtain indirect Bitcoin exposure through ETFs that invest in Bitcoin future contracts. These ETFs will create exposure by deploying an option overlay strategy which includes selling put options and buying call options at the same stroke price. The spot Bitcoin ETP’s will track the price of BTC by holding actual BTC as their underlying asset. This will provide BTCI will the ability to benefit from BTC as the price appreciates by holding these Spot Bitcoin ETPs in a wholly owned and controlled foreign subsidiary. The option overlay strategy has 2 parts which include utilizing a synthetic strategy to gain exposure to the Bitcoin Futures ETF and writing call options on the Bitcoin Futures ETF to generate recurring monthly income. In order for BTCI to implement its Bitcoin Futures ETF options strategy it will invest in traditional exchange traded options or flex",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805912-neos-bitcoin-high-income-etf-utilizes-a-call-option-strategy-to-generate-double-digit-yields?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET,BTC-USD|BTCI,BTC,"NEOS Bitcoin High Income ETF Utilizes A Call Option Strategy To Generate Double Digit Yields. Summary BTCI offers a unique way to generate high monthly income from Bitcoin''s volatility, with a current annualized yield exceeding 25%. The ETF uses a synthetic covered call strategy, trading off some BTC upside for immediate income, making it ideal for income-focused investors. BTCI has delivered a 54% total return since inception, combining strong income with capital appreciation, though it underperforms pure BTC exposure. Given BTCI''s track record and a pro-crypto environment, I am bullish and plan to add it to my income-focused portfolios for future upside.

2025-07-30 13:30:00+00:00,SEC Approves In-Kind Redemptions for Crypto ETPs,"This allows authorized participants to swap ETF shares directly for Bitcoin or Ethereum instead of cash. This also is expected to reduce transaction costs and increase market efficiency. SEC Chairman Paul Atkins described the change as part of a broader strategy to create a modern, purpose-built regulatory framework for digital assets. Meanwhile, the Senate Agriculture Committee once again delayed a hearing on Brian Quintenz’s nomination to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), after a White House request. The delay adds uncertainty to the CFTC’s future leadership at a time when crypto regulatory oversight is under review in Congress. SEC Eases Crypto ETF Rules The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved in-kind creation and redemption for cryptocurrency exchange-traded products (ETPs). This is a huge milestone in the evolution of regulated crypto investment vehicles. This new allowance makes it possible for authorized representatives to exchange shares of approved Bitcoin and Ethereum funds directly for the underlying crypto assets rather than using. The move is expected to reduce transaction costs and improve market efficiency. Press release from the SEC SEC Chairman Paul Atkins classified the development as part of a broader strategy to create a fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for digital assets, and stated that the change will make crypto ETPs “less costly and more efficient.” Jamie Selway, director of the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets, explained that in-kind redemptions offer more flexibility and cost savings for issuers, participants, and investors. Until now, crypto ETFs approved by the SEC, including spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, were limited to cash-only redemption mechanisms. However, regulatory sentiment has gradually shifted. At the Bitcoin Policy Institute conference last month, SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce acknowledged the rising demand for in-kind redemptions. This regulatory pivot is also part of a much broader policy shift toward the digital asset industry, which was encouraged by the Trump administration’s support for crypto innovation and the recent passage of three key Congressional bills focusing on market structure, stablecoins, and restrictions on surveillance-based central bank digital currencies. So far, the industry responded positively to the announcement, with crypto ETFs continuing to see rising demand. US spot Bitcoin ETFs recently posted a 12-day streak of inflows totaling $6.6 billion, bringing their collective holdings to over 1.298 million BTC, which is worth approximately $152.1 billion. Ethereum ETFs are also gaining momentum , with BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF reaching over $10 billion in assets in just 251 days. Now, the SEC’s approval of in-kind mechanisms is likely to accelerate this growth, and could be the start of a new era of more efficient and investor-friendly crypto investment products. Senate Delays Quintenz CFTC Vote Again While the SEC is moving quickly and making changes, the same cannot be said for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The US Senate Agriculture Committee postponed a planned hearing on Brian Quintenz’s nomination to chair the CFTC, after a request from the White House just days before lawmakers leave for their August recess. The delay was confirmed in an update by Committee Chair John Boozman and Ranking Member Amy Klobuchar, and is the second time the committee pushed back consideration of Quintenz’s nomination. The vote was initially expected during a July 21 meeting, and then again before the Aug. 4 recess, but was removed from the schedule without a new date set. A spokesperson for the committee stated that the decision came directly from the White House, though no official comment was received from the administration. Brian Quintenz previously served as a CFTC commissioner from 2017 to 2021 under Trump and was originally nominated by President Obama. He also disclosed approximately $3.4 million in assets and faced questioning during a June hearing before the same committee. The uncertainty around his confirmation comes at a critical time, as the Senate prepares to take up legislation in September that is specifically aimed at defining regulatory responsibilities between the CFTC and the SEC over digital assets. Quintenz is considered crypto-friendly, and his appointment could have major implications for the future of digital asset policy in the US, especially as the SEC under the Trump administration dropped a number of high-profile crypto enforcement actions after former Chair Gary Gensler''s departure. Brian Quintenz The CFTC is also facing a leadership vacuum, with three of its five commissioners—former chair Rostin Behnam, Summer Mersinger, and Christy Goldsmith Romero—already having left their positions. Acting Chair Caroline Pham also suggested that she would step down if Quintenz were confirmed, and Kristin Johnson is expected to leave before 2026.

2025-07-30 13:44:11+00:00,JUST IN: JPMorgan Unlocks Crypto Buying with Chase Cards by Tapping Coinbase,"TL;DR Chase users will link bank accounts and credit cards directly to Coinbase for crypto access. Chase Ultimate Rewards points will soon convert to crypto at a 1:1 value on Coinbase wallets. JPMorgan may launch crypto-backed loans in 2026 using Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral. Chase Customers to Get Direct Access to Coinbase JPMorgan & Chase and Coinbase have announced a new partnership aimed at providing Chase customers with easier access to cryptocurrency. Starting this fall, Chase credit card holders will be able to fund their Coinbase accounts directly. This marks the first time such a feature will be made available between a major bank and a crypto exchange. In 2026, more options are expected to roll out. Chase customers will gain access to direct bank-to-wallet transfers using JPMorgan’s secure API. The plan also includes the ability to transfer Chase Ultimate Rewards points to Coinbase at a 1:1 rate. One hundred points will equal $1 in crypto credit. According to the companies , this will be the first time a credit card rewards program can be used to fund a crypto wallet. Secure Bank-to-Wallet Transfers and Reward Point Integration Meanwhile, the direct bank link will allow Chase customers to move funds between their accounts and Coinbase without needing extra steps or third-party tools. The system is being designed to give users a faster and more private way to manage digital currency. Melissa Feldsher, who oversees payments and lending innovation at JPMorgan & Chase, said the move helps customers manage both money and rewards in new ways. “By joining forces with Coinbase, we are enhancing the security and privacy of our customers’ data,” she said. “With Ultimate Rewards, our customers can now seamlessly and securely convert their points into cryptocurrencies.” Coinbase Expands Features and Token Listings Max Branzburg of Coinbase shared his thoughts on the partnership. “We’re excited to partner with JPMorganChase to onboard the next generation of consumers into crypto,” he said. “Together, we are expanding choice and lowering barriers to entry for consumers to participate in the future of financial services onchain.” Coinbase has also been updating its platform. On July 22, it added three assets, BankrCoin (BNKR), Jito Staked SOL (JITOSOL), and Metaplex (MPLX), to its asset roadmap. These tokens may be listed later, depending on market support and internal review. The exchange said it will announce launch dates if and when conditions are met. Crypto-Backed Loans Under Review at JPMorgan As CryptoPotato reported , JPMorgan is also considering crypto-backed loans. The bank may allow customers to borrow using assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum as collateral. The program could begin in 2026, though the final decision has not been made. CEO Jamie Dimon has long been skeptical of digital currencies. In past statements, he called Bitcoin a “fraud” and claimed it was mostly used for illegal activity.

Bitcoin 1-day price chart. Source: Finbold The report , produced by the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, set out to outline sweeping recommendations for integrating crypto into the U.S. financial system.

Notably, the report embraces decentralized finance (DeFi) as a key growth area and frames stablecoins as tools for strengthening the role of the U.S. dollar, marking a clear pivot toward pro‑crypto policy, underscored by calls for transparency on how crypto firms can secure banking access and master accounts.

2025-07-30 13:45:10+00:00,USDC Minting: Unveiling the Massive Impact of a $250 Million Influx,"BitcoinWorld USDC Minting: Unveiling the Massive Impact of a $250 Million Influx In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, every major transaction sends ripples across the market. Recently, the crypto community was abuzz with a report from Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracker, confirming a significant event: a massive USDC minting of 250 million USDC at the USDC Treasury. This isn’t just a number; it’s a signal, hinting at shifts in market liquidity, institutional interest, and the evolving stablecoin landscape. What does such a substantial USDC minting mean for the broader crypto ecosystem? Let’s dive deep into this fascinating development and unpack its potential ramifications. What Exactly is USDC Minting and Why Does it Matter? Before we dissect the impact of this particular event, it’s crucial to understand what USDC minting entails. USDC, or USD Coin, is a digital stablecoin pegged to the US dollar on a 1:1 basis. This means one USDC is always intended to be worth one US dollar. It’s operated by Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase, aiming for transparency and stability in the crypto space. USDC minting refers to the process where new USDC tokens are created and put into circulation. This typically happens when: New Fiat Deposits: Users or institutions deposit US dollars into Circle’s or Coinbase’s reserves. For every dollar deposited, a corresponding USDC token is minted. Demand for Stablecoin: As demand for USDC increases, more fiat currency is brought into the ecosystem, triggering new mints. The significance lies in its direct correlation with real-world assets. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, USDC offers a stable bridge between traditional finance and the blockchain world. A large-scale USDC minting event, like the recent $250 million, indicates a substantial influx of fiat currency into the crypto market, signaling increased liquidity and potential demand for other digital assets. The Significance of a $250 Million USDC Mint: A Liquidity Flood? When Whale Alert flags a quarter-billion dollar USDC minting , it’s more than just a procedural update; it’s a headline event. Such a large sum suggests significant capital movement into the crypto space. Here’s why this particular USDC minting is noteworthy: Increased Market Liquidity: More USDC means more capital available for trading, investing, and engaging with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This can reduce slippage in large trades and make the market more efficient. Institutional Interest: Large mints are often attributed to institutional players, hedge funds, or high-net-worth individuals preparing to deploy capital. They use stablecoins to enter or exit positions without incurring the volatility of direct fiat-to-crypto conversions. Growing Demand for Stablecoins: The continuous need for substantial USDC mints underscores the growing utility and trust in stablecoins as a foundational layer for the broader crypto economy. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, there’s sustained interest in stable, on-chain dollars. This substantial USDC minting could act as a precursor to significant trading activity, potentially influencing the price action of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or fueling activity within the DeFi sector. Why Do Whales Engage in Such Large-Scale USDC Minting? The term ‘whale’ in crypto refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of cryptocurrency. When a whale initiates a massive USDC minting , their motivations are often multifaceted and strategic. Understanding these reasons provides insight into broader market sentiment and potential future movements: Arbitrage Opportunities: Whales might mint USDC to capitalize on price differences across various exchanges. If a cryptocurrency is cheaper on one exchange and more expensive on another, a whale can mint USDC, buy the asset where it’s cheap, transfer it, and sell it where it’s expensive, profiting from the spread. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional trades often occur OTC to avoid impacting market prices. Whales might mint USDC to facilitate these private transactions, providing liquidity for large buyers or sellers without public market exposure. Funding Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Protocols: USDC is a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem. Whales might mint large sums to provide liquidity to decentralized exchanges (DEXs), engage in yield farming, or participate in lending protocols, aiming to earn substantial returns. Preparing for Market Entry/Exit: Rather than holding fiat in traditional bank accounts, whales might convert it to USDC to keep funds readily accessible on-chain. This allows them to quickly enter new positions when opportunities arise or exit volatile positions into a stable asset. Exchange Funding: Major exchanges might mint USDC to top up their hot wallets, ensuring they have sufficient stablecoin liquidity to meet user withdrawal demands or facilitate large trading volumes.

2025-07-30 13:49:20+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Consolidation Persists, Here’s What Could Trigger a Breakout","Bitcoin remains in a tight consolidation range with muted price action, as traders await tonight’s FOMC decision. A surprise rate cut could act as a major catalyst, potentially triggering a sharp upward breakout. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart BTC continues to trade within a tight range, showing subdued market activity and low volatility. The asset remains locked between the $116K and $123K levels, reflecting a temporary equilibrium between buyers and sellers. This sideways movement signals market indecision ahead of a major macro catalyst. The $114K level, which aligns with the lower boundary of Bitcoin’s multi-month ascending channel, serves as a crucial support. As long as this trendline holds, the bullish structure remains intact, and a retest of the $123K resistance is anticipated. However, if this level is breached, a deeper correction toward the $111K support zone becomes the more likely scenario. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin’s lack of direction is more pronounced. The asset continues to consolidate within a bullish continuation flag pattern, a classic sign of a temporary correction during an uptrend. All eyes are now on the FOMC meeting scheduled for tonight. With rising political tension and pressure from former President Trump calling for aggressive rate cuts, the possibility of a surprise decision has grown. Should the Federal Reserve announce an unexpected rate cut, Bitcoin could respond with a sharp rally, potentially breaking out of its current range and aiming for a new all-time high. Until then, the market is likely to remain muted as traders wait for confirmation from macroeconomic policy developments. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets Over the past few months, BTC experienced periods of significant futures market activity, especially during rallies approaching the $70K–$90K levels. These runs coincided with heating and overheating phases, as shown by the dense red clusters, which historically have led to corrections or consolidations. However, the most recent market behavior paints a different picture. Despite Bitcoin trading close to the $123K mark, the volume bubble map indicates a transition back into neutral and even cooling phases (grey and green bubbles), suggesting reduced speculative pressure in the futures market. This cooling off, despite elevated prices, highlights a reset in leverage and de-risking behavior among traders. From an on-chain perspective, such market cooling after overheating is often a healthy signal, indicating that the price is being supported by organic demand rather than excessive leverage. The fact that Bitcoin has climbed above $100K while futures volume shows signs of normalization strengthens the bullish outlook, as the market avoids the pitfalls of overheated speculation. If the current trend of low speculative pressure persists, BTC could be poised for another impulsive leg to the upside, potentially toward a new all-time high beyond $123K.

The asset remains locked between the $116K and $123K levels, reflecting a temporary equilibrium between buyers and sellers. This sideways movement signals market indecision ahead of a major macro catalyst. The $114K level, which aligns with the lower boundary of Bitcoin’s multi-month ascending channel, serves as a crucial support. As long as this trendline holds, the bullish structure remains intact, and a retest of the $123K resistance is anticipated. However, if this level is breached, a deeper correction toward the $111K support zone becomes the more likely scenario. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin’s lack of direction is more pronounced. The asset continues to consolidate within a bullish continuation flag pattern, a classic sign of a temporary correction during an uptrend. All eyes are now on the FOMC meeting scheduled for tonight. With rising political tension and pressure from former President Trump calling for aggressive rate cuts, the possibility of a surprise decision has grown. Should the Federal Reserve announce an unexpected rate cut, Bitcoin could respond with a sharp rally, potentially breaking out of its current range and aiming for a new all-time high. Until then, the market is likely to remain muted as traders wait for confirmation from macroeconomic policy developments. On-chain Analysis By ShayanMarkets Over the past few months, BTC experienced periods of significant futures market activity, especially during rallies approaching the $70K–$90K levels. These runs coincided with heating and overheating phases, as shown by the dense red clusters, which historically have led to corrections or consolidations. However, the most recent market behavior paints a different picture. Despite Bitcoin trading close to the $123K mark, the volume bubble map indicates a transition back into neutral and even cooling phases (grey and green bubbles), suggesting reduced speculative pressure in the futures market. This cooling off, despite elevated prices, highlights a reset in leverage and de-risking behavior among traders. From an on-chain perspective, such market cooling after overheating is often a healthy signal, indicating that the price is being supported by organic demand rather than excessive leverage. The fact that Bitcoin has climbed above $100K while futures volume shows signs of normalization strengthens the bullish outlook, as the market avoids the pitfalls of overheated speculation. If the current trend of low speculative pressure persists, BTC could be poised for another impulsive leg to the upside, potentially toward a new all-time high beyond $123K.

This isn’t a futuristic dream; it’s rapidly becoming a reality, spearheaded by major players in the crypto space. The latest buzz centers around Twenty One Capital, a firm already making waves with its substantial Bitcoin holdings, now exploring the groundbreaking potential of Bitcoin-backed loans . This strategic move could redefine how institutions leverage their crypto assets, bridging the gap between the burgeoning digital economy and established financial systems. Who is Twenty One Capital and Why Do They Matter in the Realm of Bitcoin-Backed Loans ? Twenty One Capital isn’t just another name in the crypto sphere; it’s a formidable entity with significant backing and an impressive digital asset portfolio. The firm boasts support from industry giants like Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, USDT, and Cantor Fitzgerald, a venerable Wall Street financial services firm. This powerful alliance lends immense credibility and institutional heft to Twenty One Capital’s endeavors. With a staggering holding of approximately 43,500 BTC, valued at over $5 billion, Twenty One Capital is positioning itself among the largest institutional Bitcoin holders globally. This substantial treasury of Bitcoin isn’t just sitting idle; it represents a significant pool of potential collateral, making the firm a pivotal player in the emerging market for Bitcoin-backed loans . Their exploration into this innovative financial product signals a growing trend: institutions are not just accumulating Bitcoin; they are actively seeking sophisticated ways to utilize it beyond mere speculation. By considering dollar loans secured by their massive Bitcoin reserves, Twenty One Capital is not only optimizing its own capital structure but also setting a precedent for how other large entities might manage and leverage their digital assets in the future. What Exactly Are Bitcoin-Backed Loans and How Do They Work? At its core, a Bitcoin-backed loan is a financial instrument that allows individuals or institutions to borrow fiat currency (like USD) or stablecoins by pledging their Bitcoin as collateral. Think of it like taking out a mortgage on your house, but instead of real estate, your digital gold is securing the loan. The beauty of this mechanism lies in its ability to provide liquidity without forcing the borrower to sell their Bitcoin, thus allowing them to retain ownership and potential future appreciation of their digital asset. Key Mechanics of a Bitcoin-Backed Loan : Collateral Pledging: The borrower transfers a specified amount of Bitcoin to a lender or a smart contract (in a decentralized setup) as collateral. This collateral acts as security for the loan. Loan Disbursement: The lender provides the agreed-upon loan amount in fiat currency or stablecoins. The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio typically ranges from 30% to 70%, meaning you can borrow 30-70% of your Bitcoin’s value, depending on the lender and market conditions. Interest and Repayment: The borrower pays interest on the loan over a defined period, similar to traditional loans. Once the loan, plus interest, is fully repaid, the Bitcoin collateral is released and returned to the borrower. Price Volatility Management: This is crucial due to Bitcoin’s inherent price volatility. Loans often include margin call thresholds. If the value of the pledged Bitcoin drops below a certain LTV, the borrower may be required to add more collateral (a ‘margin call’) or repay a portion of the loan to prevent the collateral from being liquidated. This financial innovation offers a compelling alternative for those who believe in Bitcoin’s long-term value but require immediate access to capital for various purposes, from business operations to strategic investments, without divesting their crypto holdings. The Strategic Imperative: Why are Bitcoin-Backed Loans Gaining Traction Now? The increasing interest in Bitcoin-backed loans isn’t coincidental; it’s a reflection of the evolving crypto landscape and the growing sophistication of institutional players. Several factors contribute to this rising trend: Maturing Market: The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly beyond its early speculative days. With established infrastructure, clearer regulatory discussions, and a growing understanding of digital assets, institutions are more comfortable exploring complex financial products. Demand for Capital Efficiency: Large institutional holders of Bitcoin, like Twenty One Capital, often have significant capital tied up in their digital assets. They need ways to unlock this capital for operational expenses, new investments, or even share buybacks, without incurring capital gains taxes by selling their holdings.

2025-07-30 13:59:13+00:00,"Bitcoin, real estate, and the long game: inside Elías Sacal’s vision for Murano","For over 30 years, Murano Global Investments Plc (Nasdaq: MRNO) has stood as one of Mexico’s most prolific real estate developers, with a portfolio that spans luxury hotels, resort residences, and large-scale commercial projects. With over $2 billion in capitalization deployed, and partnerships with global brands like Hyatt and Accor, Murano’s track record is built on a rare combination of architectural permanence and capital discipline. At the center of that legacy is Elias Sacal – Chairman, CEO, and the guiding force behind Murano’s evolution from regional player to publicly listed company. Now, Sacal is leading Murano into a new chapter, one that integrates Bitcoin into the company’s long-term balance sheet strategy. Earlier this year, Murano acquired its first 21 Bitcoin. The decision was understated by design, a reflection of Sacal’s long-held belief that capital, like architecture, should be patient and purpose-built. “We’ve always focused on assets that endure,” Sacal says. “Bitcoin, like real estate, is scarce, resilient, and built for the long term.” Murano’s digital asset strategy is supported by a $500 million Standby Equity Purchase Agreement with Yorkville, enabling the company to gradually increase its Bitcoin holdings over time. This capital is earmarked from real estate development profits and selective asset sales – a model that prioritizes self-financing over debt and builds reserves without diluting shareholder value. But Sacal’s ambitions go beyond portfolio construction. Murano is actively exploring ways to incorporate Bitcoin into its operating businesses, including the potential for BTC-native hospitality offerings, integrated loyalty systems, and new experiences designed for digital asset holders. These initiatives aim to bridge physical infrastructure with emerging financial ecosystems – not as marketing, but as meaningful value creation. That vision is consistent with Sacal’s broader approach. In the early 2000s, he helped pioneer the “Second Home Living” model across Mexico’s resort markets, positioning Murano at the forefront of international capital inflows into coastal real estate. Under his leadership, the firm has expanded into Mexico City, Cancún, Ixtapa, and Baja, with development projects that blend luxury, utility, and long-term value. Today, Murano manages over $1 billion in appraised assets, has constructed more than 1,400 hotel rooms, and holds management agreements with several of the world’s top-tier hospitality operators. Continuity guides every decision, be it architectural or financial. “Vision has always been at the core of what we do,” Sacal notes. “Whether we’re designing a hotel or allocating capital, the question is always the same—will this create value ten, twenty, or fifty years from now?” As capital markets evolve and Bitcoin matures as an institutional-grade asset, Sacal is positioning Murano to meet the future with both feet on the ground and eyes firmly on the horizon. He’s not rejecting traditional finance, but augmenting it. Not shifting strategies, but extending them. Murano’s direction is clear: real assets on the ground, digital assets on the balance sheet. And under Sacal’s leadership, it is becoming a model for how legacy institutions can evolve with clarity, discipline, and conviction — not by chasing trends, but by quietly setting the standard.

The U.S. stock market has kicked off the day with a robust ascent, signaling a positive sentiment that could ripple far beyond traditional equities. For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these movements in the broader financial landscape is crucial. After all, the lines between traditional finance and digital assets are blurring, and what happens in one often influences the other. Today’s Stellar U.S. Stock Market Performance As the trading day commenced, major indices across the U.S. stock market registered notable gains, painting a picture of optimism among investors. This initial upward momentum suggests a prevailing ‘risk-on’ sentiment, where market participants are more willing to embrace assets with higher potential returns, often a good sign for growth-oriented sectors and, by extension, the often-volatile crypto market. Here’s a quick look at how the key indices performed at the open: Index Opening Performance What It Represents S&P 500 +0.10% A broad gauge of the U.S. economy, representing 500 large U.S. companies. NASDAQ Composite +0.20% Heavily weighted towards technology and growth companies. Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.03% A price-weighted average of 30 significant stocks traded on the NASDAQ and NYSE. The modest yet positive gains across these benchmarks indicate a healthy start to the day, reflecting underlying confidence in corporate earnings, economic data, or perhaps expectations around monetary policy. While seemingly small percentages, these early movements often set the tone for the entire trading session and can provide clues about broader market sentiment. What’s Driving This Upward Momentum in the U.S. Stock Market? When the U.S. stock market opens higher, it’s rarely due to a single factor. Instead, it’s typically a confluence of economic indicators, corporate news, and investor psychology. Understanding these drivers can offer valuable insights into market behavior. Positive Economic Data: Recent releases of economic data, such as lower-than-expected inflation figures, robust job growth, or strong consumer spending reports, can instill confidence. These indicators suggest a resilient economy, which bodes well for corporate profits and, consequently, stock valuations. Strong Corporate Earnings: As companies report their quarterly results, better-than-anticipated earnings or optimistic forward guidance can significantly boost investor confidence. When a majority of major corporations exceed expectations, it creates a positive ripple effect across the entire market. Investor Sentiment: Market psychology plays a massive role. Positive news, whether economic or geopolitical, can lead to a surge in investor optimism, encouraging more buying activity. Conversely, fear or uncertainty can lead to selling pressure. Today’s open suggests a prevailing optimistic mood. Anticipation of Monetary Policy: Expectations regarding interest rates and central bank policies are always a key driver. If investors anticipate that central banks might ease monetary policy or maintain favorable rates, it can make equities more attractive compared to bonds, driving capital into the stock market. These elements collectively contribute to the market’s initial direction. A positive open often reflects a belief that the economic environment is conducive to corporate growth and investment returns, which is a foundational element for any thriving market. How Do U.S. Stock Market Trends Ripple Through the Crypto World? For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, the performance of the U.S. stock market isn’t just background noise; it’s a crucial indicator. Historically, there’s been a noticeable correlation, especially between tech-heavy indices like the NASDAQ and major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Here’s why this interconnectedness matters: Risk-On/Risk-Off Dynamics: When the traditional stock market is in a ‘risk-on’ mood, meaning investors are seeking higher returns and are willing to take on more risk, this sentiment often spills over into the crypto market. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often seen as ‘risk assets’ by institutional investors. If capital flows into equities, it often flows into crypto as well. Institutional Investment: A strong stock market encourages institutional investors to allocate more capital across various asset classes. As crypto adoption grows among these large players, a healthy traditional market environment can lead to increased institutional interest and investment in digital assets.

In a recent post on X, he explained that VET printed a clean five-wave impulse more than a year ago, and he now believes the subsequent corrective Wave 2 is nearing completion. If accurate, this sets the stage for an explosive Wave 3 move, often the most powerful leg in Elliott Wave theory. To support his conviction, CrediBULL compared the structure to Bitcoin’s historic $3K bottom, noting that the last time he observed such a clean impulse was just before BTC launched into its multi-year rally from those lows.

CrediBULL Crypto, a well-followed technical analyst, has begun accumulating VeChain (VET) as a “till end of cycle” hold, based purely on chart structure. In a recent post on X, he explained that VET printed a clean five-wave impulse more than a year ago, and he now believes the subsequent corrective Wave 2 is nearing completion. If accurate, this sets the stage for an explosive Wave 3 move, often the most powerful leg in Elliott Wave theory. To support his conviction, CrediBULL compared the structure to Bitcoin’s historic $3K bottom, noting that the last time he observed such a clean impulse was just before BTC launched into its multi-year rally from those lows. Have begun building a position in $VET as a ""till end of cycle"" hold. Purely a technical play as we printed a clean impulse over a year ago and I believe based on current market context the subsequent Wave 2 should be coming to an end relatively soon. $BTC chart as a comparison… pic.twitter.com/BefJ0mrtxP — CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) July 29, 2025 VET Price Overview and Market Snapshot As of report time, VeChain (VET) is trading at $0.02410, down roughly 4.5% over the past 24 hours.

2025-07-30 14:00:15+00:00,Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Market Sits Between Accumulation And Distribution,"Bitcoin remains trapped in a tight consolidation range that began over two weeks ago, fueling expectations of an imminent breakout or breakdown. The lack of decisive movement has created a state of market indecision, with neither bulls nor bears taking full control. Price continues to hover between key support and resistance levels, showing no strong signs of accumulation or distribution. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Begin Distribution: Mirroring Fall 2024 Cycle According to new data from CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase—a metric that reflects the overall temperature of the market—currently sits at a neutral level. This indicates that market conditions are balanced, with no clear dominance from buyers or sellers. Profit-taking remains moderate, ETF inflows have slowed, and long-term holder activity is stable, all of which support the view that the market is in a wait-and-see mode. The current structure suggests that a major move is likely approaching. With volatility compressed and the market treading water, traders and investors are closely watching for a signal that will define the next leg. Whether Bitcoin breaks out toward new highs or rolls over into a correction, the coming days will be crucial in shaping the short-term trend and broader sentiment across the crypto landscape. Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase Signals Neutral Market Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights into the Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase—a metric that condenses several key market indicators into a single scalar value, offering a simplified yet powerful view of where Bitcoin stands in its broader macro cycle. The metric combines data points such as overvaluation assessments, profit-taking activity, long-term holder (LTH) selling pressure, and ETF inflows to gauge whether the market is overheated or entering a favorable accumulation zone. When the Heat Macro Phase reaches high values near 50%, it typically signals that these components are at their upper historical bounds—suggesting an overheated market that may be nearing a distribution phase or a correction. Conversely, readings closer to 30% reflect cooler market conditions: lower profit-taking, modest ETF activity, and minimal LTH selling. These scenarios often indicate that the market is undervalued and ripe for accumulation. Currently, the Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase sits at 44%, putting it squarely in the neutral zone. Adler explains that this level reflects a balanced market environment—neither overbought nor undervalued. There’s no clear dominance by bulls or bears. Profit-taking is beginning to accelerate, but it hasn’t reached a level that would suggest a broader exit is underway. This mid-range reading aligns with Bitcoin’s recent price action, which has remained in a tight consolidation for over two weeks. As the metric hovers in neutral territory, it reinforces the idea that the next significant move—whether upward toward new highs or downward in a correction—will depend entirely on upcoming price behavior. For now, the Bitcoin Heat Macro Phase acts as a market barometer, signaling patience as investors wait for the next breakout or breakdown to confirm direction.

2025-07-30 14:04:16+00:00,Ethereum at 10: What''s Next for the World Computer?,"When Ethereum launched on July 30, 2015, it set out to be more than just another cryptocurrency. It aimed to expand the boundaries of blockchain technology itself. While Bitcoin became digital gold, Ethereum pursued a more expansive vision: to be a decentralized “World Computer”—programmable, extensible, and open-ended. A decade later, Ethereum has transformed finance, culture and software. Along the way, it has faced existential crises, volatile markets and fierce internal debates. Now, it stands on the cusp of a new era—one that may see it fully embraced by traditional finance. Ethereum has seen an uptick in the last two months as the project hits the 10 year milestone, with its ETH’s price rebounded, reaching $3,800 in July , after it languished around $1500 just in April. Over the last few months, the ecosystem has seen a new wave of use cases including tokenization and stablecoin growth, and the network also benefited from the trend of companies holding ETH in their treasuries, not just for long-term value, but to earn yield. The Whitepaper That Started It All Ethereum was born from a whitepaper penned by then-19-year-old Vitalik Buterin in 2014, a Canadian college dropout and passionate Bitcoin enthusiast who, inspired by the limitations he saw in Bitcoin, envisioned a more versatile blockchain platform. The network went live a year later, backed by the newly formed Ethereum Foundation (EF), which was tasked with supporting development and spreading Ethereum’s mission. But Ethereum’s honeymoon phase didn’t last. In 2016, the now-infamous DAO Hack nearly broke the network apart when a smart contract vulnerability allowed an attacker to siphon off over 3.6 million ETH, about $13.5 billion at today’s prices. To undo the damage, Ethereum executed a controversial hard fork, effectively creating a new version blockchain. At the time, many saw that the decision to splinter it off broke with the foundational blockchain principle that transactions are immutable and the system is permissionless, raising concerns that human intervention could undermine trust in the protocol''s neutrality. After the split, the original chain continued on as Ethereum Classic. “We showed that we made the right decision, instead of letting the attacker keep all of that ether back then, and that would have been a burden on us this entire time, with trying to get adoption and [focus on building] different things,” said Hudson Jameson, the former Protocol Community Lead at the Ethereum Foundation, in an interview with CoinDesk. The ICO Boom and the Road to the Merge Following the DAO episode, Ethereum entered a period of explosive growth. The 2017 ICO boom saw startups raise billions using ERC-20 tokens. DeFi protocols like MakerDAO, Compound, and Uniswap emerged, enabling permissionless lending, borrowing and trading. But Ethereum’s success exposed its weaknesses. Network congestion and high gas fees revealed a dire need for scalability. Developers began work on Ethereum’s most ambitious upgrade: transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake in what would become known as the Merge. The effort, which began in 2017, culminated on September 15, 2022. The transition reduced Ethereum’s energy consumption by over 90% and opened the door to staking. At the same time, layer-2 rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync began to take shape. These networks offered faster, cheaper transactions while leveraging Ethereum’s security. “The moment when we realized that layer-2s were really taking off and we started to see L2 transaction volumes equal or exceed those of the mainnet and at much, much lower costs,” was a turning point, said Paul Brody, global blockchain leader at EY. Today, layer-2 solutions are bringing in major players. Robinhood announced it will build its own rollup using Arbitrum tech, while Deutsche Bank plans to leverage ZKync for its blockchain initiatives. A Crisis at the Ethereum Foundation? After a grueling bear market in 2022–2023, crypto began to recover. Bitcoin surged past $100,000 . Solana, offering quicker transactions and lower fees, emerged as a viable competitor, attracting more new developers to its ecosystem than Ethereum , as well as capital and hype. Meanwhile, ether lagged, dropping to a four-year low against bitcoin in December 2024 , prompting concerns among some in the community about Ethereum’s future, and whether the EF was doing enough to steer the development in the right direction. As things started to bubble up into a crisis, core figures at the Foundation started to ask about where the ecosystem was heading. “How do we ensure that it''s the best thing by many standards? How does it win? How does it be the thing that is adopted,” said Danny Ryan, former Ethereum Foundation core developer and Merge architect.

2025-07-30 14:05:35+00:00,Altcoin Season May Have Finally Arrived Amid Institutional Interest and Clarity,"A long-awaited rotation from Bitcoin to the altcoin market could be in motion, as per Sygnum’s Q3 2025 Investment Outlook. The digital asset bank points to increased regulatory clarity, on-chain activity, and improved market liquidity as the catalysts behind this shift, hinting that the much-anticipated “altseason” may have finally begun. Earlier in the year, geopolitical uncertainty and concerns around U.S. fiscal stability had pushed investors toward Bitcoin, temporarily suppressing the altcoin market. But with regulatory bodies now offering clearer guidance—especially regarding staking and token classification—altcoins with strong fundamentals are seeing renewed interest. Bitcoin Dominance Fades Amid Altcoin Resurgence According to Sygnum, Bitcoin’s dominance recently fell by more than 6% after reaching its highest levels since 2021 . While Bitcoin remains in a strong position—driven by high demand, limited supply, and over $160 billion now locked in spot ETFs—capital appears to be flowing back into the altcoin market. Bitcoin’s recent all-time high above $123,000 was backed by surging institutional interest, including over 110,000 BTC accumulated by ETFs last quarter. Ether also displayed bullish signals, with falling balances on exchanges, increasing ETF inflows, and nearly 30% of its liquid supply staked. In particular, Ethereum has captured institutional attention following its successful Pectra upgrade, which raised staking limits and improved network performance. Sygnum noted that the SEC’s recent clarification that protocol staking does not violate securities laws further strengthened investor confidence in ETH. A wave of tokenization efforts from major financial institutions like BNY Mellon and Société Générale, as well as political entities backing stablecoins like the USD1, are increasingly being built on Ethereum, reinforcing its position as a leader in the smart contract ecosystem. DEX and DeFi See Explosive Growth Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) captured 30% of crypto spot market share last quarter, setting a new record with over $530 billion in trading volume. This rise was fueled in part by the popularity of memecoin launches, particularly on platforms like PancakeSwap and Solana’s PumpSwap. The DeFi lending sector also reached new highs, with $70 billion in total value locked. Liquid staking now accounts for over 30% of all staked Ether, as investors continue to embrace higher risk and leverage. Still, Sygnum warned that altcoin enthusiasm—especially around memecoins—could risk creating another bubble, with a sharp correction likely if speculative momentum outpaces fundamentals.

2025-07-30 14:10:11+00:00,Bitcoin Reserve Asset: Canaan’s Bold Strategic Shift Towards Digital Gold,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Reserve Asset: Canaan’s Bold Strategic Shift Towards Digital Gold In a significant move that echoes through the corridors of both traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset world, Canaan, a prominent Nasdaq-listed Chinese mining equipment manufacturer and Bitcoin mining firm, has made a resounding declaration: Bitcoin is now its primary long-term reserve asset. This isn’t just a simple treasury adjustment; it’s a powerful statement, cementing Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy as a core financial holding for public companies. With 1,484 BTC, valued at approximately $74 million, now firmly on its balance sheet, Canaan is not only selling the picks and shovels of the crypto gold rush but also strategically accumulating the digital gold itself. This strategic pivot marks a crucial milestone, aligning Canaan’s financial destiny even more closely with the broader Bitcoin ecosystem and reinforcing the narrative of Bitcoin as a formidable Bitcoin reserve asset . Why Embrace a Bitcoin Reserve Asset Strategy? Why are more and more companies, especially those deeply embedded in the blockchain industry, choosing to hold Bitcoin as a significant part of their treasury? The rationale behind adopting a Bitcoin reserve asset strategy is multi-faceted and compelling. For decades, corporate treasuries have relied on traditional assets like cash, bonds, and equities. However, the current economic landscape, characterized by inflationary pressures and low interest rates, has prompted a re-evaluation of these conventional approaches. Bitcoin offers a compelling alternative for several reasons: Inflation Hedge: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s finite supply (capped at 21 million coins) makes it a potent hedge against inflation, unlike fiat currencies which can be devalued by quantitative easing. Store of Value: Its decentralized nature and robust network security provide a reliable, censorship-resistant store of value, particularly attractive in an unpredictable global economy. Industry Alignment: For companies like Canaan, whose core business revolves around Bitcoin mining, holding BTC as a reserve asset creates a direct alignment of interests. Their success is intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s success, fostering greater commitment and potentially enhancing investor confidence. Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically demonstrated significant long-term growth potential, offering the possibility of substantial appreciation for corporate balance sheets. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously led the charge, accumulating vast amounts of Bitcoin, showcasing a bold vision for corporate treasury management in the digital age. Their conviction has inspired many others to consider the merits of a substantial Bitcoin reserve asset . Canaan’s Pivotal Move: A Deep Dive into their Bitcoin Reserve Asset Holdings Canaan’s decision to designate Bitcoin as its primary long-term reserve asset is a significant testament to the digital currency’s maturing status. According to Stock Titan, the company now holds 1,484 BTC, a substantial sum valued at around $74 million at the time of the announcement. This isn’t merely a speculative investment; it’s a foundational shift in their financial strategy. What does this mean for Canaan and its position in the market? Beyond Hardware: Canaan is traditionally known as a leading manufacturer of Bitcoin mining hardware, providing the essential infrastructure for the global mining industry. By holding such a significant Bitcoin reserve asset , they are effectively transforming into a hybrid entity – not just a supplier, but also a direct participant and accumulator in the Bitcoin economy. Strategic Alignment: This move perfectly aligns their corporate treasury with their operational focus. As a Bitcoin mining firm, their profitability is tied to Bitcoin’s price and network health. By holding BTC, they mitigate some operational risks and capitalize directly on the asset they help secure and grow. Confidence in Bitcoin: The fact that a Nasdaq-listed, publicly traded company is making such a declaration sends a powerful signal to the market. It demonstrates a deep-seated confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term viability, stability, and potential as a legitimate financial asset, further solidifying the narrative of Bitcoin as a reliable Bitcoin reserve asset . This strategic accumulation positions Canaan not just as a technology provider but as a significant stakeholder in the future of decentralized finance. What are the Implications of Holding a Bitcoin Reserve Asset? While the benefits are clear, adopting a substantial Bitcoin reserve asset strategy also comes with its own set of implications and challenges that companies must carefully navigate.

The Ethereum rate is also losing momentum as it approaches the psychological mark of $4,000. This was reported by analysts at QCP Capital. In their opinion, in the medium term there remains a high probability of reaching new all-time highs. This is facilitated by institutional capital inflows and positive changes in regulation. Analysts noted that companies like SharpLink Gaming continue to raise funds to buy Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicating long-term confidence in these assets. Total daily net inflows into the ETH ETF are $218.64 million. However, in the short term, experts urge caution. The market reacts weakly to positive news, including the adoption of crypto-friendly legislation in the US and progress in the ETF space. The lack of growth on the back of good news often signals market exhaustion and is classic late-cycle behavior, the experts emphasized. Threat from the dollar Analysts associate the main macroeconomic risk with the US dollar. Most traders are betting on its weakening by opening short positions. According to the CFTC, the number of such positions has reached extreme values. This situation leaves the market vulnerable to a short squeeze. If the dollar exchange rate starts to rise, traders will be forced to close unprofitable trades en masse. This could trigger a move away from risky assets, including cryptocurrencies, analysts explained. The focus will be on U.S. inflation and employment data in the coming days, which will determine the market''s development in the third quarter. At the July meeting, Fed analysts expect the key rate to remain unchanged. The regulator will most likely emphasize that its decisions depend on incoming data. The September meeting will be key, as the chances of a rate cut remain balanced. The majority (97.5%) of market participants expect the indicator to remain at the same level following the meeting on July 30. Bitcoin Falls to $110,000 Glassnode analysts have indicated a possible correction in Bitcoin to the $110,000 level to test key support. The reason could be a ”price gap” without significant trading volume at this level. Experts explained that as the price rose rapidly from $110,000 to $115,000, investors had little time to buy, creating an area without strong support based on the asset purchase price. “There remains an air pocket of volume between $115,000 and $110,000 below the current spot price. This is the result of the price moving through the range without any room for transactions,” the report said. Glassnode believes the market may test this zone in search of support. Although such gaps are not always filled, they create a ”pull” for the price. Analysts used the cost basis of short-term holders to identify potential support levels, which also help identify prices at which investors might begin to take profits. Using standard deviation, Glassnode predicted a possible local maximum of around $140,000 if growth resumes. “If the market breaks higher, $141,000 is likely to be the next major resistance area where selling pressure could quickly intensify,” the firm concluded.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10262/bitcoin-and-ethereum-market-update-support-institutional-flows-and-dollar-risk,MARKET|BTC|TRADING|ETH|FIAT,News|Crypto,BTC,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Market Update: Support, Institutional Flows & Dollar Risk.

2025-07-30 14:15:11+00:00,Kraken Revenue: Remarkable Q2 Growth Unveiled Despite Investment Challenges,"BitcoinWorld Kraken Revenue: Remarkable Q2 Growth Unveiled Despite Investment Challenges In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, where market shifts can be as swift as they are significant, understanding the financial performance of leading exchanges offers invaluable insights. Recently, major cryptocurrency exchange Kraken unveiled its second-quarter results, painting a compelling picture of growth and strategic investment. This deep dive will explore the latest figures, unpack the strategic decisions behind them, and offer a comprehensive view of Kraken’s journey in a constantly evolving digital asset landscape. Let’s explore the impressive figures behind Kraken Revenue. Kraken Revenue: A Deep Dive into Q2’s Financial Triumphs Kraken, a prominent player in the global cryptocurrency exchange arena, has reported a substantial uplift in its second-quarter revenue. According to JinSe Finance, citing Bloomberg, the exchange saw its revenue climb an impressive 18% year-over-year, reaching a robust $412 million . This significant increase underscores Kraken’s enduring appeal and operational strength in a competitive market. While the top-line revenue figure certainly stands out, a closer look at the underlying metrics reveals the pillars supporting this growth. Here’s a snapshot of Kraken’s Q2 performance: Total Revenue: $412 million (an 18% year-over-year increase) Adjusted Pre-Tax Profit: $79.7 million (a 7% decrease year-over-year) Trading Volume: $186.8 billion (a 19% increase year-over-year) Funded Accounts: 4.4 million (a 37% increase year-over-year) The impressive surge in Kraken Revenue, coupled with the growth in trading volume and funded accounts, signals a healthy expansion of its user base and increased engagement on its platform. These figures collectively highlight Kraken’s ability to attract and retain users, even as market conditions fluctuate. Navigating the Waters: Why Did Kraken’s Pre-Tax Profit Dip? Despite the stellar revenue growth, Kraken’s adjusted pre-tax profit experienced a slight dip, falling approximately 7% to $79.7 million. At first glance, this might seem counterintuitive when revenue is on the rise. However, the report clarifies that this decrease is a direct consequence of Kraken’s strategic investments. The exchange has been channeling significant resources into two key areas: New Product Development: Innovation is crucial in the fast-paced crypto industry. Kraken’s commitment to building and launching new products and features ensures it remains at the forefront of technological advancements and meets the evolving needs of its users. These investments often involve substantial research and development costs, as well as hiring specialized talent. Geographic Expansion: Broadening its global footprint is another strategic imperative for Kraken. Expanding into new markets requires significant upfront investment in legal and regulatory compliance, localized marketing efforts, and establishing operational infrastructure. While these investments can temporarily impact profitability, they are essential for long-term growth and market penetration. This strategic decision to prioritize long-term growth over immediate profit maximization is a common play for mature companies in high-growth sectors. It suggests that Kraken is confident in the future potential of the crypto market and its own position within it, choosing to build a stronger, more resilient foundation for sustained expansion. The investment in new products and geographic expansion is crucial for future Kraken Revenue streams. Unpacking the Surge: What Drove Kraken’s Trading Volume and User Growth? The impressive 19% increase in trading volume, reaching $186.8 billion, and the 37% surge in funded accounts to 4.4 million are not mere coincidences. They are indicative of several factors contributing to Kraken’s robust performance. What’s fueling this growth? Market Recovery and Sentiment: The second quarter saw a period of renewed optimism in the broader crypto market. As Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies experienced price stabilization or upward trends, investor confidence often returns, leading to increased trading activity. Kraken’s platform, known for its liquidity and security, is well-positioned to capitalize on such shifts in market sentiment. Platform Reliability and Security: In an industry plagued by security concerns and platform outages, Kraken has consistently emphasized its commitment to robust security measures and reliable uptime. This focus builds user trust, a critical factor in attracting and retaining traders. Diverse Product Offerings: While the report mentions investments in new products, Kraken already offers a wide array of services beyond spot trading, including staking, margin trading, and OTC services.

2025-07-30 14:22:41+00:00,Bitcoin dubbed the ‘S&P 500 of the future’: here’s what it means,"22V Research chief investment officer Jordi Visser says Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is the “S&P 500 of the future.” With digital assets, including Ethereum, gaining traction, and the “GENIUS Act” becoming a law, Visser believes the current cycle marks a turning point in crypto’s mainstream adoption. Bitcoin has already surpassed its previous high and is now trading near $120,000, but according to Visser, who spoke in a recent interview with CNBC, the cryptocurrency still has substantial upside potential. What Bitcoin as the S&P 500 of the future means Visser’s comparison of Bitcoin to the S&P 500 isn’t just metaphorical – it’s a strategic framing of Bitcoin as a foundational asset in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. As artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts traditional industries, Visser argues that BTC represents a resilient store of value outside the legacy financial system. He sees it as a hedge against systemic change, much like how the S&P 500 reflects the health of corporate America. In his view, Bitcoin will increasingly anchor portfolios in the years ahead, especially as stablecoins and digital assets become more integrated into everyday transactions. It’s not just a tech bet – it’s a macro hedge. Bitcoin vs crypto-proxies: Visser picks a side According to Jordi Visser, choosing between buying Bitcoin or investing in crypto-proxies instead depends primarily on the investor’s risk tolerance. Those interested in chasing higher upside, albeit with more volatility, he recommends building a position in proxies like MicroStrategy Inc (NASDAQ: MSTR), the largest corporate holder of BTC . Personally, however, Visser favours direct exposure to Bitcoin as it’s a more stable and strategic long-term play. While companies like Bitmine Immersion or Bit Digital offer alternative routes to gain exposure to the crypto market, the 22V Research chief investment officer continues to see BTC as the most reliable asset in a world of accelerating technological disruption. Note that Bitcoin has materially outperformed the benchmark stock market indices this year, and is currently up well over 50% versus its year-to-date low in early April. Is it too late to invest in Bitcoin? Speaking with CNBC , Visser revealed the most common question he receives from traditional fiat investors is: “Am I too late” in building a position in the likes of Bitcoin? His answer is a resounding no. Visser believes many sceptics will eventually own BTC – they just won’t admit it publicly. Drawing parallels to hidden voter behaviour in political polls, Visser argues the leading crypto’s growing legitimacy makes it harder to ignore. The 22V Research expert maintains a bold price target of $200K for Bitcoin this year, underscoring his belief in its long-term potential. As AI adoption accelerates and stablecoins become more prevalent, Visser sees Bitcoin as a necessary hedge in portfolios navigating an uncertain future.

In a significant move that underscores growing confidence in the cryptocurrency market, Belgravia Hartford Capital, a publicly traded Canadian investment firm, has successfully secured a substantial $5 million convertible debenture specifically earmarked for a strategic Bitcoin investment . This development not only highlights the increasing mainstream adoption of digital currencies but also provides a fascinating glimpse into how traditional finance is finding innovative ways to engage with the crypto economy. Belgravia Hartford’s Bold Move: A Strategic Bitcoin Investment Belgravia Hartford Capital, known for its diversified investment portfolio, recently announced the closure of a C$5 million (approximately US$3.65 million at current exchange rates, though the article states $5 million directly for simplicity) convertible debenture. This significant capital injection comes from the Round13 Digital Asset Fund, a notable player in the digital asset space. The terms of the agreement are straightforward yet impactful: a 4% annual interest rate with a maturity period of two years. The primary objective? To acquire Bitcoin (BTC), directly integrating the world’s leading cryptocurrency into Belgravia Hartford’s asset holdings. This isn’t just another routine financial transaction; it’s a calculated decision by a public company to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin, signaling a deeper conviction in its long-term value proposition. For many years, institutional players have approached cryptocurrencies with caution. However, as the market matures and regulatory clarity slowly emerges, firms like Belgravia Hartford are demonstrating a willingness to commit significant capital, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. Understanding the Mechanics: What is a Convertible Debenture? The term “convertible debenture” might sound complex, but it’s a relatively common financial instrument that offers flexibility. In essence, it’s a type of loan issued by a company that can be converted into a specified number of shares of the issuing company’s common stock at the lender’s option. Here’s a breakdown of its key features in this context: Debt Component: Initially, it functions like a bond. Belgravia Hartford receives $5 million and agrees to pay 4% interest annually to Round13 Digital Asset Fund for two years. Convertibility Option: At maturity, or under certain conditions, Round13 has the option to convert the principal amount of the debenture into common shares of Belgravia Hartford Capital. This provides Round13 with potential upside if Belgravia Hartford’s stock performs well. Purpose: Crucially, the funds raised are explicitly designated for a Bitcoin investment . This transparency is vital for understanding the firm’s strategic intent. Benefit for Belgravia Hartford: It’s a way to raise capital without immediately diluting existing shareholders (if it’s converted, dilution occurs later) and often comes with lower interest rates than traditional loans, especially when tied to a specific growth opportunity like Bitcoin. Benefit for Round13: They get a fixed interest return, plus the potential to participate in the equity growth of Belgravia Hartford if their strategic Bitcoin investment pays off and boosts the company’s valuation. This structure showcases a sophisticated approach to financing a digital asset acquisition, blending traditional finance tools with the innovative world of crypto. Why Bitcoin Investment Now? The Institutional Imperative The decision by Belgravia Hartford to allocate substantial capital towards Bitcoin isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a broader trend of increasing institutional interest in the digital asset space. Several factors contribute to this growing imperative for a Bitcoin investment : Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed by some as a digital store of value, akin to “digital gold,” offering a potential hedge against currency debasement. Scarcity and Supply Cap: Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it a deflationary asset, a stark contrast to fiat currencies that can be printed infinitely. This scarcity is a significant draw for long-term investors. Emerging Asset Class: As the cryptocurrency market matures, Bitcoin has established itself as a legitimate, albeit volatile, asset class that can offer diversification benefits within a broader investment portfolio. Growing Infrastructure: The development of robust custody solutions, regulated exchanges, and institutional-grade products has made it safer and more feasible for traditional firms to engage with Bitcoin.

2025-07-30 14:30:00+00:00,Dash price prediction 2025-2031: Is DASH recovering soon?,"Key takeaways Dash price prediction for 2025 could reach a maximum value of $27.82. By 2028, DASH could reach a maximum price of $94.43. In 2031, DASH will range between $234.36 to $283.25 Since entering the cryptocurrency space, Dash has held the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts as a Bitcoin fork . It has been around for some years, and Dash Crypto has maintained an impressive performance all this while. However, the price action in recent times has been unremarkable. Investors who are considering adding DASH to their crypto portfolio should ask the following questions: How high can DASH go? Will Dash (DASH) recapture its all-time high of $1,642? Let’s get into the Dash price prediction for 2025 – 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Dash Token DASH Price $20.66 Market Cap $260.94M Trading Volume $27.61M Circulating Supply 12.35M DASH All-time High Date $1,642.22 (Dec 20, 2017) All-time Low Date $0.2139 (Feb 14, 2014) 24-h High $21.5 24-h Low $20 Dash price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $ 21.91 (3.08%) Volatility 7.62% 50-day SMA $ 21.47 14-Day RSI 42.93 Current Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 74(Greed) Green Days 16/30 (53%) 200-Day SMA $ 22.80 Dash price analysis: DASH slides 4.6% as bears test key support levels Strong resistance at $21.97 DASH repeatedly failed to break $21.97, confirming heavy selling pressure at that level. Critical support at $20.70 is testing $20.70; a breakdown could trigger further downside. The bearish trend is intact, and lower highs and lower lows across timeframes confirm sustained bearish control. On July 30, 2025, Dash (DASH) traded at $20.66, posting a 4.61% decline over the past 24 hours. The price action remained under pressure as DASH moved away from its intraday high of $21.97 and approached the $20.70 support level. The sharp downturn pushed the token near key technical zones, indicating increased volatility and bearish sentiment in the short term. With the overall crypto market seeing mixed performance, DASH’s bearish momentum stands out as traders reassess positions near critical levels. Dash 1-day technical outlook: DASH battles resistance as momentum weakens On the daily timeframe, DASH is showing signs of sustained bearish momentum, with price action closing below the mid-range and testing the $20.70 support zone. The daily candlestick pattern suggests strong seller dominance, as the price rejected near $21.97, a notable resistance level. The rejection from that zone led to a continued slide throughout the session, forming lower highs and lower lows—typical of a descending structure. DASH is currently trading beneath the 20-day and 50-day moving averages, further validating short-term weakness. DASH/USDT Chart By TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is heading toward the oversold territory, hovering around 39, suggesting that bearish pressure still has room to push lower before a potential bounce. The MACD histogram has flipped negative, with its signal line confirming a bearish crossover. This alignment reflects a shift in momentum to the downside, with no immediate reversal signs. Volume has picked up slightly during the decline, reinforcing the strength behind the current downtrend. Dash 4-hour price chart: DASH slides along the lower Bollinger band On the 4-hour chart, DASH continues to reject near-term resistance zones with increasing downside pressure. The price has been rejected multiple times around the $21.50–$21.97 zone and is now gravitating toward the lower Bollinger Band. This signals prolonged selling pressure with limited recovery attempts during intraday moves. DASH/USDT Chart By TradingView Momentum remains weak as the RSI on the 4-hour timeframe trends below 30, while the MACD continues to diverge bearishly. Structure-wise, DASH consistently sets lower highs and lower lows, with sellers firmly in control. Unless the price can be reclaimed at $21.00 on substantial volume, short-term action remains tilted to the downside.

With DASH trading at $20.66, just above the critical support level of $20.70, the short-term outlook remains bearish unless buyers reclaim lost ground quickly. A break below $20.70 could expose the asset to further downside risk, with the next potential support likely forming near the psychological $20.00 mark or lower. On the upside, any recovery attempt must overcome stiff resistance at $21.97 to shift sentiment.

2025-07-30 14:30:23+00:00,Ex-Bridgewater CIO Warns Market’s Next Big Move Could Be Driven by Just a Handful of Executives – Here’s Why,"A former executive at the hedge fund founded by billionaire Ray Dalio says she’s closely monitoring the sentiment of Corporate America’s top executives as earnings season picks up speed. In a new CNBC Television interview, ex-Bridgewater chief investment officer Rebecca Patterson says this earnings season will offer key insights into the trajectory of the US economy in the months ahead. Patterson says that while strong bank earnings reflect the health and sentiment of US consumers, she notes that it’s now time to keep a close eye on the outlook of America’s C-suite executives. “I’m watching more than anything else is the qualitative assessment by the executives of where we go from here. I don’t really care about the backward-looking. I want to know: are input costs going up yet? Are they investing more or less? Because their sentiment will drive corporate activity over the next six months, and that’s going to be a big factor for the broader macro view.” Patterson also believes that America will soon feel the brunt of Trump’s tariffs, as the forces that have helped to keep inflation in check begin to fade. “I think going forward, the inventories that had helped us have been wound down. Trans-shipments helped, and that’s something the government is going to get tough on. So I do think there’s a greater chance that we’re going to see more of the tariff impact come through on prices. And then it’s a question: how much does a consumer bear? How much do corporates absorb? We don’t know what that exact mix would be, but directionally, I think the risk is that we have higher inflation in the second half of this year.

The price has surged by over 51% in July 2025, closing near $3,766 and approaching a key horizontal resistance zone at $3,859, marked by a previous swing high. The triangle pattern, bounded by a gradually rising support trendline and a descending resistance trendline from the all-time high, has compressed price action since late 2021. ETH is now testing the upper boundary of this structure. A clean breakout above this resistance zone could open the door for higher targets, with Fibonacci extensions indicating possible upside levels around $4,228 (3.618 Fib) and $4,698 (4.236 Fib), with the $3,467 (2.618 Fib) already cleared intramonth. The RSI indicator on the monthly timeframe is reinforcing this bullish setup. After months of sideways action below 50, the RSI has triggered a fresh buy signal by crossing above its moving average and is now sitting at 60.09. This same RSI crossover pattern previously preceded the early 2023 rally. A monthly close above the $3,850–$4,000 resistance range would confirm the breakout and likely trigger a rally toward the $4,200–$4,700 area.

Santiment analytics indicate that over the past two weeks, Bitcoin wallets containing at least 1,000 BTC decreased by 1.61%. Conversely, Ethereum wallets holding at least 10,000 ETH increased by 8.00% during the same period. Source: Saintment This enhanced ETH/BTC dominance has enabled the asset to recover from its yearly low of $1,383.26, reaching a 2025 peak of $3,941.86 on July 28. Numerous cryptocurrency traders and expert analysts are now anticipating an ETH price breakthrough above $4,000. gold vs eth if we follow this fractal, we should top around $4k and then a pullback to $3k followed by news highs in Q4 https://t.co/91ZmrrziYF pic.twitter.com/gHi5HzfOs5 — Honey (@honey_xbt) July 21, 2025 Altcoin investor “Altcoin Gordon” shares his bullish sentiment, describing ETH as “a beach ball underwater right now.” He predicts that once ETH breaks $4,000, the rally to $5,000 will be “fast and VIOLENT.” Technical Analysis Points to Ethereum $4,000 Triangle Breakout The monthly chart of Ethereum (ETH/USD) from TradingView shows a significant bullish breakout attempt from a multi-year symmetrical triangle pattern. The price has surged by over 51% in July 2025, closing near $3,766 and approaching a key horizontal resistance zone at $3,859, marked by a previous swing high. The triangle pattern, bounded by a gradually rising support trendline and a descending resistance trendline from the all-time high, has compressed price action since late 2021. ETH is now testing the upper boundary of this structure. A clean breakout above this resistance zone could open the door for higher targets, with Fibonacci extensions indicating possible upside levels around $4,228 (3.618 Fib) and $4,698 (4.236 Fib), with the $3,467 (2.618 Fib) already cleared intramonth. The RSI indicator on the monthly timeframe is reinforcing this bullish setup. After months of sideways action below 50, the RSI has triggered a fresh buy signal by crossing above its moving average and is now sitting at 60.09. This same RSI crossover pattern previously preceded the early 2023 rally. A monthly close above the $3,850–$4,000 resistance range would confirm the breakout and likely trigger a rally toward the $4,200–$4,700 area. However, failure to sustain above this range could lead to a retest of the lower trendline near $2,700. For now, momentum and structure f"

Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of both a Bitcoin stockpile and a broader digital asset reserve to position the US as a global leader in blockchain finance. Despite this, Wednesday’s report, issued by the Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, makes no reference to that plan. SEC and CFTC Urged to Act Now The document focuses heavily on regulatory reforms aimed at streamlining crypto market oversight and promoting innovation. Chief among its recommendations is a call for Congress to pass the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would grant the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) authority over spot markets for non-security digital assets. This move is meant to close longstanding regulatory gaps. The report also urges the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to immediately provide more explicit rules on trading, registration, custody, and recordkeeping, using their current powers without waiting for new legislation. The working group said , “By implementing these recommendations, policymakers can ensure that the United States leads the blockchain revolution and ushers in the Golden Age of Crypto.” Backs DeFi Innovation, Stablecoin Adoption, Rejects CBDCs Decentralized finance (DeFi) also received a supportive nod. In fact, the group endorsed tools like regulatory sandboxes and safe harbors to help financial products reach consumers faster. Stablecoins took center stage as well, following Trump’s recent signing of the GENIUS Act. The report urges quick implementation of the law and portrays USD-backed stablecoins as crucial to reinforcing the dollar’s dominance in digital finance. However, it draws a hard line against central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), which echoed Trump’s prior support for an “Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act” to ban them outright. The group also tackled crypto banking and called for transparency on how institutions can obtain bank charters while simultaneously urging clarification on what crypto activities are permissible for banks. In terms of tax policy, the report recommended treating digital assets as a new class for federal taxation, subject to updated rules on wash sales and alternative minimum tax. It also pressed the Treasury and IRS to revise guidance on crypto-related activities such as mining and staking.

2025-07-30 14:33:58+00:00,"MARA Reports 64% Q2 Revenue Increase, Pushes Bitcoin Hyper to Soar","Bitcoin mining giant Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) has exceeded Wall Street expectations with a 64% year-over-year revenue increase to $239M, coupled with a remarkable 505% surge in net income. Such success is mainly due to its aggressive Bitcoin accumulation. A $1.2B unrealized gain from BTC’s 31% Q2 rally contributed to MARA’s profit of over $808M —a remarkable recovery compared to its staggering $200M loss in Q2 2024 . As MARA expands its Bitcoin mining technology and leverages the #1 crypto, developers are racing to unlock the network’s next utility phase. This is where Bitcoin Hyper stands tall. By Q3 2025, this top trending crypto project promises to bring super speedy and cost-friendly transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain. MARA Snags 50K $BTC, Becomes Bitcoin’s #2 Whale The market responded quickly to MARA’s Q2 results. Yesterday, the company’s shares jumped by 7.5% in after-hours trading to $17.82. It has since evened out at $16.61. Still, when checking out its big $BTC bucks, MARA shows no signs of slowing down. Shortly after Q2 wrapped, MARA’s Bitcoin holdings surpassed 50K $BTC . Its $BTC holdings have surged 170% year-over-year to 49,551 $BTC, valued at around $5.3B by the end of June. Since then, it has climbed to $5.87B, making MARA the second-largest $BTC holder, right behind MicroStrategy, which holds a substantial $BTC stash exceeding $71B. But as institutional interest in $BTC increases, there’s a hitch: The network isn’t designed for speed, scalability, or smart contracts. Thankfully, Bitcoin Hyper ’s getting set to solve such woes. Bitcoin Hyper to Soon Solve Bitcoin’s Limitations As a highly scalable Layer 2 solution, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the upgrade Bitcoin needs. When launched in Q3 2025, it aims to make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, and support smart contracts. By strategically utilizing the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , the Layer 2 vows to be as fast as the Solana network while maintaining Bitcoin’s steadfast security. But it’s not just about fast and cost-friendly payments. Bitcoin Hyper aims to bring new utility to the Bitcoin network, including dApps, the best meme coin launches, and real-world asset tokenization. Supporting real-world asset tokenization is a major boon; the market recently topped $24B as more Wall Street giants dive in to digitize treasuries, private credit, and even real estate on-chain. Bitcoin Hyper has what it takes to become a key player in the next wave of institutional blockchain adoption. At the heart of it all is a Canonical Bridge (similarly used by Arbitrum and Linea), which allows you to move $BTC back and forth between the Bitcoin Layer 2 and Layer 2—all while facilitating smart contract functionality. However, you’ll want to purchase $HYPER to get the most out of Bitcoin Hyper. Already, it has raised $5.8M+ over granting governance rights, lower gas fees, and staking rewards at a 175% APY. Verdict – $HYPER Could Become the Real Winner As Bitcoin draws more institutional investors and MARA rides the wave, the Bitcoin network’s limitations need to be addressed more than ever. Thankfully, Bitcoin Hyper is set to provide a much-needed upgrade to Bitcoin during increased demand. You can join the movement by purchasing $HYPER on presale for just $0.01245. And there might not be a better time to do precisely that for possible 2,470% gains—once the Layer 2 officially launches, it’s anticipated to reach $0.32 . This isn’t investment advice.

2025-07-30 14:46:54+00:00,Trader Just Found His 2013 Bitcoin Wallet With $10 Initial Investment,"In a post that quickly circulated through crypto circles, crypto commentator Bark (@barkmeta) revealed that a long-forgotten Bitcoin wallet from 2013, which he originally funded with just $10. At the time of his tweet, that $10 investment had risen by almost 5,000% to $4,991. The revelation was greeted with responses from users reflecting on past purchases, missed opportunities, and the long-term potential of cryptocurrency. Despite the relatively small initial investment, the story served as a potent reminder of Bitcoin’s price trajectory over the past decade. Just found my 2013 Bitcoin wallet. $10 initial investment. Holy cow. pic.twitter.com/uu3R3fuzd8 — Bark (@barkmeta) July 28, 2025 Old Wallets, New Regrets Some users shared similar discoveries or reflections. One individual revealed that he found a BNB wallet from 2017, recalling that he bought BNB at $7. BNB is currently trading above $800, representing a substantial growth of over 11,300%. Another wondered how rich Bark would be if he had invested $1,000 instead of just $10, but Bark joked that he was spending on snacks and video games during that time instead of investing. For many, it was less about the specific dollar figures and more about what those early decisions represented. A BTC wallet that was dormant for over 14 years was recently activated , and the market is full of investors who have held their Bitcoin since the beginning and are waiting for further growth before selling. The Long View on Early Adoption One community member remarked that “we’re still early,” suggesting that despite Bitcoin’s current price sitting close to $120,000, adoption and value potential remain far from exhausted. Bark replied , “99% don’t understand this,” reinforcing the belief that many people still underestimate the long-term implications of holding digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Other users in the comments emphasized that a little patience could go a long way. One person said , “Just a little goes a long way in the right spot.” Experts have applied the same principle to other assets, such as XRP, with prominent voices in the crypto space consistently advising the community to hold their tokens . Some have even urged investors to move their cryptocurrencies to cold wallets for safekeeping. Looking Forward from Today’s Starting Point In response to the post, one user imagined a future scenario where he had just found a 2025 XRP wallet with an initial $25 investment, asking what it might be worth five years from now. Experts are already setting $250,000 targets for Bitcoin and $12 for XRP in 2025 , and the comment underlined a key takeaway that today’s trivial amount could represent life-changing gains in the future.

In a post that quickly circulated through crypto circles, crypto commentator Bark (@barkmeta) revealed that a long-forgotten Bitcoin wallet from 2013, which he originally funded with just $10. At the time of his tweet, that $10 investment had risen by almost 5,000% to $4,991. The revelation was greeted with responses from users reflecting on past purchases, missed opportunities, and the long-term potential of cryptocurrency. Despite the relatively small initial investment, the story served as a potent reminder of Bitcoin’s price trajectory over the past decade. Just found my 2013 Bitcoin wallet. $10 initial investment. Holy cow. pic.twitter.com/uu3R3fuzd8 — Bark (@barkmeta) July 28, 2025 Old Wallets, New Regrets Some users shared similar discoveries or reflections. One individual revealed that he found a BNB wallet from 2017, recalling that he bought BNB at $7. BNB is currently trading above $800, representing a substantial growth of over 11,300%. Another wondered how rich Bark would be if he had invested $1,000 instead of just $10, but Bark joked that he was spending on snacks and video games during that time instead of investing. For many, it was less about the specific dollar figures and more about what those early decisions represented. A BTC wallet that was dormant for over 14 years was recently activated , and the market is full of investors who have held their Bitcoin since the beginning and are waiting for further growth before selling. The Long View on Early Adoption One community member remarked that “we’re still early,” suggesting that despite Bitcoin’s current price sitting close to $120,000, adoption and value potential remain far from exhausted. Bark replied , “99% don’t understand this,” reinforcing the belief that many people still underestimate the long-term implications of holding digital assets.

One person said , “Just a little goes a long way in the right spot.” Experts have applied the same principle to other assets, such as XRP, with prominent voices in the crypto space consistently advising the community to hold their tokens . Some have even urged investors to move their cryptocurrencies to cold wallets for safekeeping. Looking Forward from Today’s Starting Point In response to the post, one user imagined a future scenario where he had just found a 2025 XRP wallet with an initial $25 investment, asking what it might be worth five years from now. Experts are already setting $250,000 targets for Bitcoin and $12 for XRP in 2025 , and the comment underlined a key takeaway that today’s trivial amount could represent life-changing gains in the future.

2025-07-30 14:49:20+00:00,Beijing Court Jails Tech Executive 14 Years for $19.5M Crypto Laundering,"Beijing authorities sentenced tech executive Feng to 14 years for a $19.5 million crypto laundering scheme at a major short video platform. According to a People’s Daily report , the Haidian District People’s Court convicted Feng and seven co-conspirators of occupational embezzlement after they illegally stole 140 million yuan in company incentive funds. Prosecutors revealed that Feng leveraged his role overseeing service provider approvals and reward policies to create deliberate loopholes that external partners Tang and Yang exploited between 2023 and 2024. From Bonus Incentives to a Multi-Million Yuan Fraud Feng’s scheme began when he conspired with familiar external suppliers to manipulate the platform’s subsidy policies designed to attract new service providers and encourage operator activities. He was said to have deliberately embedded vulnerabilities into new incentive bonus policies while secretly sharing confidential operational data with his co-conspirators outside the company. Tang and Yang used this insider information to submit fraudulent applications that met incentive requirements, effectively claiming rewards meant for legitimate service providers and platform operators. The trio rapidly escalated their operation by instructing accomplices to register multiple shell companies whose sole purpose was receiving platform rewards before quickly transferring funds through layered organizational structures. Yang directed subordinate Wang to establish these phantom entities, which received the stolen incentives before funneling money into secret accounts controlled by the conspiracy’s leadership. Shell Firms and Exchanges Layered Laundering Operation The 140 million yuan theft marked only the beginning of a more complex international money laundering operation that would challenge Chinese investigators for months. Feng instructed his partners to convert the embezzled funds into cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, across eight different overseas virtual currency trading platforms to obscure the money’s origins. The conspirators employed sophisticated “coin mixing” techniques that obfuscated transaction paths through technical means, making it nearly impossible for traditional financial investigators to trace fund movements. Source: OKX This mixing process allowed Feng’s network to further disguise the source, type, and circulation chain of their digital assets while maintaining plausible deniability about fund origins. Portions of the laundered cryptocurrency were eventually converted back into Chinese yuan through covert channels and deposited into personal and corporate accounts controlled by core conspiracy members. Prosecutor Li Tao from the Haidian District People’s Procuratorate’s Science and Technology Crime Prosecution Team used advanced electronic data review techniques to reconstruct the entire money flow. Feng’s criminal organization ultimately surrendered more than 90 bitcoins they had hidden after facing irrefutable digital evidence, allowing the affected company to recover a significant portion of its losses. The Haidian court ultimately sentenced all eight defendants to prison terms ranging from three to 14.5 years, with Feng receiving the longest sentence as the scheme’s mastermind. Crypto’s Expanding Role in Global Financial Crime Similar large-scale cryptocurrency laundering operations have surfaced across multiple countries, with Chinese authorities recently dismantling a $136 million network that used digital currencies for cross-border fund transfers spanning 10 provinces. Brazilian authorities recently confronted an even larger operation where hackers stole $180 million from the banking system and immediately attempted to convert stolen funds to Bitcoin and USDT through cryptocurrency exchanges. A cyberattack on Brazil’s Central Bank has triggered a wave of crypto laundering, with $40 million in stolen funds funneled into crypto. #Brazil #Crypto https://t.co/JVQtuZ6HX2 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 6, 2025 US prosecutors have also charged Russian crypto CEO Iurii Gugnin with orchestrating a $530 million fraud scheme using his Miami-based platform Evita to funnel payments through US banks and crypto platforms. The sophistication of these operations has prompted legislative responses, including proposed cryptocurrency mixer bans , as lawmakers recognize that traditional anti-money laundering frameworks struggle with decentralized digital assets. However, enforcement still faces significant technical challenges as mixing services like eXch continue to operate through backend infrastructure even after its official shutdown announcement.

2025-07-30 14:50:40+00:00,XRP ETPs See $189M Weekly Inflows as U.S. Mortgage Law Sparks Investor Buzz,"Why XRP ETPs Attracted $189.6 Million in Weekly Inflows According to CoinShares’ report for the week ending Friday, July 25, global crypto ETPs posted $1.9 billion in net inflows, marking the 15th consecutive week of positive flows. Within this, XRP-linked products pulled in $189.6 million, trailing only Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) in terms of institutional interest. This influx pushed year-to-date cumulative inflows to $29.5 billion, and total assets under management across crypto ETPs reached a record $221.4 billion. Analysts, including CoinShares’ James Butterfill, signal that the spike in XRP ETP flows likely reflects investor positioning ahead of potential spot or futures XRP ETF approvals in the U.S., rather than a broad-based altcoin rally. The distinction between Bitcoin, which saw outflows of $175 million and XRP underscores that dynamic. Beyond product innovation, XRP’s technical orientation has come into sharper focus. On‑chain metrics indicate strong activity, with daily new wallet growth averaging more than 7,500 addresses, suggesting rising demand and support levels above $3.3 amid whale accumulation. Technical chart patterns, including golden‑cross signals versus Bitcoin, further accentuate bullish sentiment. Crypto‑Backed Mortgages Come Into View Last month, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a directive ordering Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to begin incorporating cryptocurrency holdings into mortgage risk assessments. Previously, crypto had to be converted to USD before being counted; now digital assets like XRP may qualify directly as part of an applicant’s reserves. Building on that, Senator Cynthia Lummis has introduced the 21st Century Mortgage Act , a bill that would formally allow crypto, including XRP held via qualified custodians and stablecoins to be counted when applying for U.S. mortgages, without requiring conversion to cash. This Act is surfacing at a time when the White House Crypto Policy is taking shape. What This Means for XRP Holders For the XRP Army the 21st Century Mortgage Act is monumental: No more forced sales. They can keep accumulating XRP while simultaneously qualifying for a home loan. A credibility boost. Acceptance by major U.S. financial institutions would mark XRP’s transition from speculative asset to mainstream financial tool. Potential price catalyst. Experts suggest that institutional recognition and expanded utility could drive demand and prices from the $3 range to $6 or even higher in coming months As a result, enthusiasts on X, formerly Twitter, and other platforms are sharing bold perspectives; some even forecast that XRP could soon become actual mortgage “money” under U.S. infrastructure. Conclusion By letting crypto holdings count toward mortgage eligibility, these policy changes elevate XRP from a niche token to a recognized household financial instrument in America. For the XRP Army, that not only reinforces long‑term conviction but also creates tangible real‑world utility and possibly a fresh bull run. On the other hand, XRP ETPs captured $189.6 million of new capital, signaling strong institutional momentum backed by regulatory confidence, technical breakout potential, and expanding access via new ETF and ETP vehicles.

2025-07-30 14:54:29+00:00,New Zealand''s Sharesies to roll out retail cryptocurrency trading in August,"New Zealand-based investment platform Sharesies is entering the crypto market. Co-CEO Leighton Roberts announced the company will roll out retail cryptocurrency trading in August. This comes amidst increased user demand and all-time high crypto market rallies driven by Bitcoin. “At Sharesies, we see an opportunity to make crypto investment more straightforward and less overwhelming for New Zealanders -whether they are new to crypto or seasoned investors who want to reduce complexity.” Co-CEO Leighton Roberts The platform intends to make investing in digital assets easier by removing popular obstacles associated with wallets and personal keys. Early access can be obtained via a waiting list by Sharesies users. The platform seeks to collaborate with a leading crypto exchange to enable smooth processes of purchasing, selling, and storing cryptocurrencies. Roberts acknowledged crypto’s volatility but positioned the growth as an organization meeting the changing customer requirements. The service will initially cater to more significant assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. He noted, “We acknowledge that crypto may not be for everyone, but we want to provide people with choice.” The move reflects the growing demand for accessible crypto tools, especially as markets remain active. The crypto market cap has increased by 0.7% in the past 24 hours to $3.87 trillion. At the close of Tuesday, Bitcoin dipped below the $117K level, but it rallied during the European session up to above $118.2k and is moving upwards. Sharesies was launched in 2017 and has already attracted more than 700,000 investors in New Zealand and Australia. The platform already supports access to stocks, ETFs, and managed funds, and has functionality that enables fractional investment with only a single cent. The incorporation of digital assets should increase its competitiveness in a fast-evolving fintech sector. Crypto crackdown intensifies as government bans ATMs While Sharesies aims to increase the number of people who can invest in digital assets, New Zealand regulators are gaining control over the industry. The government has announced an outright ban on all cryptocurrency ATMs. The new policy will drive over 221 machines to be used within the country. The bans are a part of a wider campaign to reduce financial crime and are focused on loopholes that use crypto infrastructure. The government is also limiting foreign currency transfers to $5,000 as it remodels laws aimed at preventing money laundering and financing of terrorism. Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee stated that criminal networks needed to be isolated and have the least possible effect on legitimate enterprises. She declared the reforms in June and reiterated the government’s intentions of ensuring New Zealand is a safe and transparent place to conduct business. A recent report by the Ministerial Advisory Group on Transnational, Serious and Organised Crime cited improper use of crypto ATMs to quickly move money offshore.

2025-07-30 15:23:32+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips Below $118,000 Ahead Of Fed Rate Cut Decision","Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $118,000 during the ongoing session as the flagship cryptocurrency extended its losses for a third day. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $117,577, with sellers in control. BTC has been consolidating between $116,000 and $120,000 over the past two weeks, indicating caution as markets wait for the Federal Reserve’s decision on rate cuts. Strategy Acquires 21,000 BTC After 2025’s Biggest Public Offering Michael Saylor’s Strategy has purchased 21,021 BTC for $2.46 billion, at an average cost of $117,256 per coin. The latest purchase takes the company’s total holdings to 628,791 BTC , worth over $74 billion at current prices. Saylor announced the latest purchase on X, stating, “Strategy has acquired 21,021 BTC for ~$2.46 billion at ~$117,256 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.0% YTD 2025. As of 7/29/2025, we hodl 628,791 acquired for ~$46.08 billion at ~$73,277 per bitcoin.” The purchase comes after Strategy raised $2.5 billion from its fourth preferred stock, STRC, making it the largest initial public offering in 2025. Strategy raised $2.5 billion through the sale of 28 million Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock (STRC) for $90 per share. The offering was significantly upsized from an initial goal of $500 million. This was the largest IPO in the US in 2025 in terms of gross proceeds, and was twice as large as the $1 billion for stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group, which went public in June. The offering is Strategy’s latest use of financial products to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) . The Saylor-led company has utilized equity, debt, and convertible notes to fund its purchases and has influenced several other companies to adopt similar strategies. Twenty One Capital’s Bitcoin Stash Bigger Than Expected Cantor Fitzgerald-backed Twenty One Capital has increased its Bitcoin holdings, significantly expanding its holdings beyond what was announced at launch. The Bitcoin treasury company added 5,800 BTC from stablecoin issuer Tether, taking its total holdings to 43,500 BTC , around 1,500 BTC more than initially projected. The company’s Bitcoin holdings are worth over $5 billion at current prices. Twenty One Capital is backed by Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank. The company’s planned merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Cantor Equity Partners will allow it to go public. Crypto Traders Fooling Themselves With Price Predictions Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes crypto traders who think they can make accurate price predictions are fooling themselves. Brandt stated, “Anyone who looks at the charts and tries to tell you where anything is going is actually just kind of fooling themselves. There are a lot of people who will argue with me, of course.” According to Brandt, the only real use of price charts in crypto is checking where the price has been and where it is now. “In most cases, you can say, probabilistically, a market will pursue the same trend it''s been with some volatility within a range.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a third day, falling below $118,000 during the ongoing session as markets await the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. Analysts and market experts believe the Fed will likely keep interest rates steady when Chair Jerome Powell concludes the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. However, President Trump has put immense pressure on Powell to cut interest rates or resign. BTC and the broader markets have remained relatively flat, preparing for a politically charged day when Powell addresses the media at a scheduled press conference. Despite the pressure from President Trump, Fed Chair Powell appears set to hold the rates at current levels, especially with inflation at 2.7%, significantly higher than the Fed’s target of 2.0%. Analysts have also pointed out that BTC’s bullish setup remains intact. However, with key macroeconomic catalysts set to impact markets, investors are being cautious. BTC traded in the red the previous weekend, dropping over 1% on Friday. Sellers retained control on Saturday, with the price registering a marginal decline. The flagship cryptocurrency ended Sunday with a 0.48% drop to settle at $117,240. BTC recovered on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $119,603. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,397, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,980. Despite the positive sentiment, it lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 0.99% and settling at $118,794.

Bitcoin (BTC) dipped below $118,000 during the ongoing session as the flagship cryptocurrency extended its losses for a third day. BTC is marginally down during the ongoing session, trading around $117,577, with sellers in control. BTC has been consolidating between $116,000 and $120,000 over the past two weeks, indicating caution as markets wait for the Federal Reserve’s decision on rate cuts. Strategy Acquires 21,000 BTC After 2025’s Biggest Public Offering Michael Saylor’s Strategy has purchased 21,021 BTC for $2.46 billion, at an average cost of $117,256 per coin. The latest purchase takes the company’s total holdings to 628,791 BTC , worth over $74 billion at current prices. Saylor announced the latest purchase on X, stating, “Strategy has acquired 21,021 BTC for ~$2.46 billion at ~$117,256 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.0% YTD 2025. As of 7/29/2025, we hodl 628,791 acquired for ~$46.08 billion at ~$73,277 per bitcoin.” The purchase comes after Strategy raised $2.5 billion from its fourth preferred stock, STRC, making it the largest initial public offering in 2025. Strategy raised $2.5 billion through the sale of 28 million Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Preferred Stock (STRC) for $90 per share. The offering was significantly upsized from an initial goal of $500 million. This was the largest IPO in the US in 2025 in terms of gross proceeds, and was twice as large as the $1 billion for stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group, which went public in June. The offering is Strategy’s latest use of financial products to purchase Bitcoin (BTC) . The Saylor-led company has utilized equity, debt, and convertible notes to fund its purchases and has influenced several other companies to adopt similar strategies. Twenty One Capital’s Bitcoin Stash Bigger Than Expected Cantor Fitzgerald-backed Twenty One Capital has increased its Bitcoin holdings, significantly expanding its holdings beyond what was announced at launch. The Bitcoin treasury company added 5,800 BTC from stablecoin issuer Tether, taking its total holdings to 43,500 BTC , around 1,500 BTC more than initially projected. The company’s Bitcoin holdings are worth over $5 billion at current prices. Twenty One Capital is backed by Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank. The company’s planned merger with special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Cantor Equity Partners will allow it to go public. Crypto Traders Fooling Themselves With Price Predictions Veteran trader Peter Brandt believes crypto traders who think they can make accurate price predictions are fooling themselves. Brandt stated, “Anyone who looks at the charts and tries to tell you where anything is going is actually just kind of fooling themselves. There are a lot of people who will argue with me, of course.” According to Brandt, the only real use of price charts in crypto is checking where the price has been and where it is now. “In most cases, you can say, probabilistically, a market will pursue the same trend it''s been with some volatility within a range.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) extended its losses for a third day, falling below $118,000 during the ongoing session as markets await the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. Analysts and market experts believe the Fed will likely keep interest rates steady when Chair Jerome Powell concludes the two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. However, President Trump has put immense pressure on Powell to cut interest rates or resign. BTC and the broader markets have remained relatively flat, preparing for a politically charged day when Powell addresses the media at a scheduled press conference. Despite the pressure from President Trump, Fed Chair Powell appears set to hold the rates at current levels, especially with inflation at 2.7%, significantly higher than the Fed’s target of 2.0%. Analysts have also pointed out that BTC’s bullish setup remains intact. However, with key macroeconomic catalysts set to impact markets, investors are being cautious. BTC traded in the red the previous weekend, dropping over 1% on Friday. Sellers retained control on Saturday, with the price registering a marginal decline. The flagship cryptocurrency ended Sunday with a 0.48% drop to settle at $117,240. BTC recovered on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $119,603. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,397, ultimately registering a marginal increase. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied, rising over 2% to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,980. Despite the positive sentiment, it lost momentum on Wednesday, falling 0.99% and settling at $118,794.

2025-07-30 15:25:11+00:00,Quantum-Safe Upgrade: Sui’s Revolutionary Leap Towards Future-Proof Blockchain Security,"BitcoinWorld Quantum-Safe Upgrade: Sui’s Revolutionary Leap Towards Future-Proof Blockchain Security The digital world, especially the realm of cryptocurrencies, thrives on robust security. Yet, a looming threat casts a long shadow: the advent of quantum computing. These powerful machines, still largely in development, promise to break the very cryptographic foundations that secure our digital assets. This is why the pursuit of a quantum-safe upgrade is not just a technical challenge, but a critical mission for the longevity and security of decentralized finance. Fortunately, innovative minds are already at work, with Sui Research recently proposing a groundbreaking solution that could safeguard EdDSA-based blockchains like Sui, Solana, Near, and Cosmos from this impending digital storm. Understanding the Quantum Threat and the Imperative for a Quantum-Safe Upgrade To truly appreciate the significance of a quantum-safe upgrade , it’s essential to grasp the nature of the threat. Traditional computers process information in bits, which are either 0 or 1. Quantum computers, however, use ‘qubits’ that can be 0, 1, or both simultaneously (superposition), allowing them to perform complex calculations at speeds unimaginable by today’s machines. While this holds immense promise for scientific discovery, it also poses a direct threat to current cryptographic standards. Shor’s Algorithm: A quantum algorithm capable of efficiently factoring large numbers, which is the mathematical basis for many public-key cryptosystems like RSA and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Grover’s Algorithm: Can significantly speed up brute-force attacks on symmetric key ciphers and hash functions, potentially weakening their security. EdDSA Vulnerability: Many modern blockchains, including Sui, Solana, Near, and Cosmos, rely on EdDSA (Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for their digital signatures. While robust against classical attacks, EdDSA, being a form of elliptic curve cryptography, is theoretically vulnerable to quantum attacks using Shor’s algorithm. The urgency for a quantum-safe upgrade stems from the ‘harvest now, decrypt later’ scenario. Malicious actors could potentially collect encrypted data today, store it, and decrypt it years later once powerful quantum computers become widely available. This makes proactive measures, rather than reactive ones, absolutely crucial for the long-term security of blockchain ecosystems. Sui Research’s Ingenious Approach to a Quantum-Safe Upgrade Sui Research has stepped forward with a remarkably elegant solution: a backward-compatible, quantum-safe wallet upgrade specifically designed for EdDSA-based blockchains. What makes this proposal particularly ingenious is its ability to integrate enhanced security without disrupting the existing infrastructure or user experience. As reported by Cointelegraph, this method cleverly sidesteps several major hurdles: Key Innovations of Sui’s Quantum-Safe Upgrade: Feature Benefit Impact on Users/Chains No Address Changes Users retain existing wallet addresses. Seamless transition, no confusion or loss of funds due to address changes. No Re-signing Required Past transactions and digital assets remain valid. Preserves historical data and chain integrity without user intervention. Avoids Hard Forks No splitting of the blockchain into two separate versions. Ensures network continuity and avoids potential community divisions or technical complexities. Backward Compatibility New quantum-safe signatures work alongside older ones. Gradual, non-disruptive adoption across the ecosystem. This approach targets blockchains that primarily use EdDSA, which explains why it’s a perfect fit for Sui itself, alongside major players like Solana, Near, and Cosmos. It’s a testament to thoughtful engineering, aiming to provide a robust quantum-safe upgrade without forcing a disruptive overhaul. Unpacking the Advantages of This Quantum-Safe Upgrade The implications of Sui Research’s proposal for a quantum-safe upgrade are far-reaching, offering substantial benefits to both individual users and the broader blockchain ecosystem: Enhanced User Security: The most direct benefit is safeguarding user assets against future quantum attacks. This provides peace of mind for holders of cryptocurrencies on supported chains, knowing their digital signatures and wallet security are being proactively fortified. Preservation of Chain Integrity: By avoiding hard forks and address changes, the historical ledger of these blockchains remains intact and consistent. This is crucial for the immutability and reliability that are core tenets of blockchain technology. Smooth and Non-Disruptive Transition: The backward-compatible nature means that the transition to quantum resistance can happen gradually, without forcing users to take immediate, complex actions. This significantly reduces the barrier to adoption and potential for errors.

The Haidian District People’s Court in Beijing handed down the verdict after prosecutors detailed how Feng, a former senior official at a major short video platform, abused his position to reroute company incentives through a network of shell firms and offshore exchanges. Eight people were convicted in total, with the group accused of turning internal policy loopholes into a full-scale crypto laundering operation using coin mixing services and eight foreign platforms. Reward loophole exploited Feng was found guilty of occupational embezzlement, along with seven co-defendants, for his role in manipulating the company’s incentive programme designed to reward new service providers and content operators. Between 2023 and 2024, he reportedly embedded vulnerabilities in newly crafted reward policies. These weaknesses were shared with outside collaborators Tang and Yang, who used the information to submit fraudulent applications that triggered incentive payouts. Together, the trio instructed others to create and register multiple shell firms whose only function was to receive and redirect company subsidies. Yang’s subordinate, identified as Wang, was tasked with setting up these dummy entities. Once the funds were received, they were layered through different business structures before being funnelled into controlled accounts. Bitcoin used to hide funds The fraud escalated into an international laundering operation. Prosecutors revealed that the 140 million yuan was converted into various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, using eight offshore virtual asset exchanges. This move was intended to erase the financial trail by making traditional tracking methods ineffective. Advanced mixing tools were deployed to break transaction paths, further complicating the traceability of the funds. These services scrambled the origin and movement of assets, providing a cover for the illegal activity and enabling the conspirators to claim ignorance of fund sources. Over time, some of the digital assets were reconverted into yuan through backdoor channels and transferred into both individual and corporate accounts tied to the primary suspects. The use of mixers allowed the group to operate under the radar until prosecutors reconstructed the financial flow using electronic data analysis. 90 BTC recovered The investigation, led by Li Tao of the Haidian District People’s Procuratorate’s Science and Technology Crime Prosecution Team, uncovered the digital trail and led to the recovery of more than 90 bitcoins. Facing extensive digital evidence, the group was forced to forfeit the funds, allowing the company to recoup a portion of its losses. The court imposed prison sentences ranging from three to 14.5 years on all eight defendants, with Feng receiving the longest term. The judgment closed one of the most complex corporate crypto laundering cases seen in Beijing to date. Global crypto crimes rising The Beijing case follows several international crypto-linked money laundering crackdowns.

This seems to have set it on a course for higher prices as it moves to possibly retest yearly highs. However, not everyone is completely bullish and convinced about the potential breakout opportunity of Shiba Inu. One crypto analyst in particular doesn’t see the altcoin going much higher and has predicted a major crash coming. Shiba Inu Could Crash Back Down Again In the analysis posted on Tradingview, the pseudonymous crypto analyst points out the fact that the Shiba Inu price is currently trading at a major resistance zone. At the time of the analysis, the price was trending at $0.000014 and had set its sights on the resistance above $0.00001432. This made it the level to beat, and alternatively, it is where the bears have been mounting their counterattack. As the analyst explains, the Shiba Inu price being so close to this level suggests that a resistance and possible bear down is coming. In this bearish scenario, the crypto analyst does see the price failing from here, leading to a minor bounce back and eventual crash back to previous support levels. Going by the analyst’s charts, the Shiba Inu price is likely to dump back to $0.00001299, where there is more support for the meme coin . All of this is charted on the 2-hour timeframe, suggesting a short-term turnaround for this bearish thesis. However, on the flip side, if the Shiba Inu price does successfully beat the second resistance, then it could invalidate the analyst’s bearish thesis . A continued uptrend in the crypto market will likely drag the Shiba Inu price along with it, leading to higher highs on the 2-hour timeframe as a result. SHIB Volume Stays Muted Amid the calls for a crash, the Shiba Inu trading volume has remained quite muted during this time. Although it has seen some increase in July from its June lows, the volume has declined toward the end of June. At an average of $180 million daily trading volume, it suggests that interest in the meme coin is still low among crypto traders.

2025-07-30 15:50:11+00:00,Fed Rate Cut: Why Scott Bessent’s Stance Sends Ripples Through Crypto Markets,"BitcoinWorld Fed Rate Cut: Why Scott Bessent’s Stance Sends Ripples Through Crypto Markets In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, every whisper from a key economic figure can send immediate tremors through the market. This holds especially true when the U.S. Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, weighs in on the highly anticipated Fed rate cut . His recent statement, indicating he doesn’t expect a rate cut today, as reported by the well-regarded Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, has naturally sparked considerable discussion and speculation among investors and enthusiasts alike. For those navigating the volatile crypto seas, understanding the nuances of such pronouncements is paramount, as they often hint at the broader macroeconomic currents shaping investment decisions globally. Why Does a Fed Rate Cut Matter to Crypto? The Federal Reserve, often referred to simply as “the Fed,” plays a pivotal role in shaping the global economic landscape through its monetary policy decisions. Their primary tool? Interest rates. When the Fed decides on a Fed rate cut , it typically signals a move to stimulate economic activity. Lower interest rates make borrowing cheaper for consumers and businesses, encouraging spending, investment, and ultimately, economic growth. This easing of monetary policy has profound implications for various asset classes, including the dynamic cryptocurrency market. The relationship between traditional interest rates and the nascent digital asset space is complex but generally follows a clear pattern: Risk-On Sentiment: Lower interest rates diminish the attractiveness of traditional, lower-risk investments like savings accounts and government bonds. This often pushes investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets. Cryptocurrencies, with their inherent volatility and potential for significant gains, often benefit from this “risk-on” environment. Capital flows out of traditional safe havens and into more speculative ventures, fueling demand for digital assets. Reduced Dollar Strength: A potential side effect of lower rates, particularly if the Fed cuts more aggressively than other central banks, can be a weaker U.S. dollar. Since many cryptocurrencies are priced against the dollar, a weaker dollar can make them appear cheaper and more appealing to international investors holding other currencies, thereby increasing demand. Inflation Hedging Narrative: Prolonged periods of low interest rates can sometimes fuel concerns about inflation, as more money circulates in the economy. A significant portion of the crypto community views assets like Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, often referred to as “digital gold.” In this narrative, a scenario where the Fed avoids a Fed rate cut due to persistent inflation concerns could ironically strengthen this very narrative, albeit with a different immediate price impact. Cost of Capital for Innovation: For the burgeoning crypto industry, higher interest rates mean a higher cost of capital for startups, developers, and blockchain projects seeking funding. This can slow down innovation and expansion, whereas a Fed rate cut would make financing more accessible, potentially accelerating growth within the ecosystem. Conversely, when rates are held steady or increased, it can create a “risk-off” environment, pushing investors towards safer assets and away from more volatile ones like crypto. This is precisely why Scott Bessent’s comments about no immediate Fed rate cut are so closely watched by market participants worldwide. Scott Bessent’s Insights: What His Stance Implies for the Fed Rate Cut Scott Bessent, a seasoned investor with a distinguished career that includes serving as the Chief Investment Officer for George Soros’s family office, brings a wealth of experience and a unique perspective to his role as U.S. Treasury Secretary. His insights are not merely speculative; they often reflect a deep understanding of current economic indicators, government fiscal policy, and the broader financial market sentiment. When Bessent publicly states he doesn’t expect a Fed rate cut , it carries significant weight because he is privy to high-level economic discussions and data that are not always immediately available to the public. His position allows him to offer a perspective that complements, and sometimes even foreshadows, the Federal Reserve’s official pronouncements. His statement suggests that, from his vantage point within the Treasury, the economic conditions necessary for the Fed to ease its monetary policy are not yet fully met. This could imply that inflation remains stickier than desired, or that the labor market is still robust enough to withstand current interest rate levels without significant economic distress. The Treasury Secretary’s comments, while not directly setting monetary policy, certainly inform market expectations and can influence investor behavior. For crypto investors, this means the prevailing economic winds might c",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/fed-rate-cut-impact/,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|ETH,Crypto News|Crypto Market|economic outlook|Fed rate cut|monetary policy|Scott Bessent,BTC,"Fed Rate Cut: Why Scott Bessent’s Stance Sends Ripples Through Crypto Markets.

More than 160 listed firms have now stacked up over 300,000 Bitcoin. But instead of just holding, they’re chasing yield. They’re lending, staking, writing options, and even buying NFTs to squeeze every bit of value out of their crypto. The traditional “HODL” strategy that once defined Bitcoin’s corporate era is unraveling under shareholder pressure. According to an investigative report from Bloomberg, the industry is changing course fast, and no one’s pretending otherwise. Firms that once treated Bitcoin as a symbol of rebellion against Wall Street are now borrowing its tactics. Executives aren’t pushing back. They’re joining in. Earning passive returns is the new game, and for a growing number of companies, holding without returns is no longer an option. Many of them are still figuring out how to manage risk, but that hasn’t stopped the flood of interest. Companies use lending, options, and NFTs to earn returns DDC Enterprise, a struggling Asian food firm, saw its stock halted earlier this year on the New York Stock Exchange after losses piled up. In response, the company pulled off a reverse stock split, loaded up on Bitcoin, rebranded itself as a crypto treasury, and said it would partner with QCP Capital to generate income. The stock jumped over 800% after the announcement. QCP founder Darius Sit said their goal was simple: bring the same kind of risk-managed yield strategies from traditional finance into crypto. At Pantera Capital, Cosmo Jiang said most treasury-holding companies are now at least looking into yield. Some are already earning from Ethereum and Solana staking. Others are exploring crypto lending and decentralized finance. SharpLink Gaming, one of the bigger Ethereum holders, is still building a risk plan. The firm’s vice president of operations, John Chard, said they’re being deliberate. “These things are best done in a measured way rather than being rushed,” he said. Other companies are trying more aggressive approaches. Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company, also known as BSTR, is considering writing put options to buy more Bitcoin at a discount. GameSquare Holdings, which holds Ether, recently bought a $5 million CryptoPunk NFT, not to sit on it, but to license it. Executives at the firm said they’re aiming for returns between 6% and 10% by turning even NFTs into yield-producing assets. Twenty One Capital is debating whether to lend U.S. dollars against Bitcoin collateral. Risk management becomes key as yield strategies expand With Bitcoin offering no built-in yield, companies are forced to extract income by lending coins, posting them as collateral, or selling off future gains through options. Ether Machine chairman Andrew Keys said his firm has a risk management team dedicated to keeping things under control. Still, others are skeptical. Chris Rhine at Galaxy Digital said, “Companies say they can generate 5% yield, and ‘we’ll generate 10% yield’, and immediately alarm bells are going off.” He said investors need to pay close attention to the activities behind those numbers. The crypto market still remembers what happened in 2022. Firms like Terra, Celsius, BlockFi, and FTX collapsed chasing high returns with risky strategies and unstable collateral. Today’s companies may look different, but they’re still exposed. The old anti-bank ideals of early Bitcoin believers are now colliding with quarterly earnings reports and executive pressure. That’s not how Michael Saylor built his Bitcoin play. The Strategy CEO famously took on debt and sold equity to accumulate Bitcoin for the long haul. Morten Christensen, founder of AirdropAlert.com, said firms moving into riskier yield strategies are abandoning Saylor’s long-game model. “He is playing the long game, betting on digital scarcity,” he said. “Wrapping Bitcoin in riskier financial engineering undermines the core value.” Still, Strategy hasn’t completely ruled out a pivot. A company spokesperson said they haven’t generated income yet from Bitcoin, but confirmed through SEC filings that their stance may change in the future.

But as bitcoin matures into a globally recognized asset, that mindset is no longer sufficient for whales managing hundreds of millions in BTC. The recent movement of over 80,000 BTC from eight Satoshi-era wallets — the largest such transfer in bitcoin’s history – has reignited attention around how legacy holders manage and eventually unwind vast positions. Holding spot bitcoin directly, especially in large quantities, exposes investors to avoidable risk, operational headaches and regulatory friction — not to mention the kind of custody nightmares that can keep even the most seasoned holders up at night. An alternative exists in the form of regulated bitcoin exchange-traded products (ETPs) — a proven, equity-like structure with a strong track record. Physically backed crypto ETPs have been available in Europe for over seven years.These products combine the transparency and safeguards of traditional markets with the innovation of digital assets — offering stronger security frameworks, improved liquidity access, tax and compliance efficiencies and the ability to use them as collateral for loans. For large holders, the case to move into regulated wrappers is becoming too strong to ignore. Liquidity is a major concern. Large holders who want to unwind a position often face significant slippage and counterparty risk on centralized exchanges. Alternatively, they must appoint external firms to manage the process, triggering time delays due to onboarding and KYC and often paying a premium in execution. With an ETP, the administrative hurdles are front-loaded; once onboarded, the investor has access to the ETP’s liquidity pool, simplifying and accelerating exit strategies when timing matters. Many whales believe that self-custody maximizes security. In reality, managing large spot positions is incredibly complex. Key management, cold storage logistics, succession planning and internal controls require infrastructure that few individuals — or even crypto-native funds — can maintain securely at scale. Regulated ETPs sidestep this entirely by offering professionally managed custody solutions — combining segregated accounts, insurance coverage and direct oversight from financial regulators. European structures go even further with bankruptcy-remote frameworks and legal title to the underlying BTC. This isn’t about giving up ownership, in fact, it is an upgrade to how that ownership is held: securely, transparently and with institutional-grade safeguards to avoid loss and fraud. For example, the Lazarus Group, one of North Korea’s most notorious hacking organizations, has been responsible for a significant number of crypto-related breaches, resulting in the theft of $1.5 billion this year alone. Figure 1: Total value of crypto-hacks in USD over the past several years Source: Chainalysis European ETPs allow in-kind transfers which enable investors to move bitcoin directly into and out of the fund without triggering a taxable event.

For whales thinking long term, the flexibility of in-kind flow is a major upgrade. It also unlocks new financial optionality; rather than selling their bitcoin during a major life event like buying a home, investors can borrow against their ETP holdings and access liquidity without ever parting with the underlying asset and triggering capital gains. Self-custody will always have a place, especially for users in unstable regions or those needing financial sovereignty.

For those keenly following the cryptocurrency space, the journey of an AI marketing automation startup founded by two UC Berkeley dropouts offers a compelling narrative that resonates with the spirit of disruption and decentralized thinking. Their recent achievement of securing a remarkable $28 million in Series A startup funding is not just a testament to their vision but also a beacon for aspiring innovators everywhere. The Genesis of an AI Marketing Automation Powerhouse The tale of Conversion, an AI marketing automation startup, sounds like it’s straight out of a Silicon Valley script, brimming with youthful ambition and serendipitous encounters. It began unconventionally, not in a classroom or a structured incubator, but during a high school class where Neil Tewari, now 24 and Conversion’s co-founder and CEO, found himself in hot water for watching a Bitcoin World Disrupt livestream. This seemingly minor infraction, leading to a principal’s office visit, unexpectedly connected him with a family friend who would later become their first investor, recognizing Neil’s budding interest in entrepreneurship. Fast forward to UC Berkeley, where Neil met James Jiao, his college roommate and now Conversion’s co-founder and CTO. Both shared a common dream: to build something impactful. Their early attempts included various products, like tools for marketers to buy product placement ads. The pivotal moment arrived when they signed up for HubSpot to manage their own marketing tasks. They quickly realized the potential for further automation, leading them to develop internal features to enhance their marketing efforts. This initial internal tool, built purely for their own needs, sparked a profound realization: what if others could benefit from this? This curiosity led to an extensive customer discovery phase. For two months, Neil and James conducted approximately 160 interviews with VPs of marketing from businesses ranging from 50 to 500 employees. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Marketers, despite having sophisticated tools deeply embedded in their workflows, universally expressed frustration with aspects they couldn’t automate. This collective pain point solidified their idea, providing a clear market need for their nascent AI marketing automation solution. Fueling Growth: The Journey of Startup Funding The path to significant startup funding is often fraught with challenges, but for Conversion, early validation and a strong network proved invaluable. The same family friend who first believed in Neil’s entrepreneurial spirit facilitated introductions to more marketing executives, which was crucial in securing their initial $2 million seed round. This early capital allowed Neil and James, then just 19 years old, to make a bold decision: they dropped out of college to dedicate themselves full-time to Conversion. Their approach to managing these initial funds was a lesson in frugality and dedication. They chose to live in a modest two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with five other roommates, embodying the classic startup grind where every dollar was stretched to maximize product development. This lean operational style ensured that their seed capital went directly into building and refining their core technology, rather than lavish expenses. The recent Series A round, which brought in $28 million led by Abstract, with participation from True Ventures and HOF Capital, underscores the immense confidence investors now place in Conversion’s vision and execution. This significant injection of capital, bringing their total funding to $30 million, marks a new chapter, enabling them to scale operations, expand their team, and further innovate their AI marketing automation platform. Navigating the Tech Entrepreneurship Landscape The journey of tech entrepreneurship is dynamic, requiring founders to adapt quickly to evolving technological landscapes. Conversion’s development coincided with the explosive rise of generative AI, particularly the emergence of ChatGPT. This presented both a challenge and an immense opportunity. While many legacy marketing automation tools rushed to integrate various AI and chat functionalities, their existing architectures often struggled to fully support these new capabilities. Conversion, however, had the distinct advantage of baking AI into its core from the ground up. This fundamental integration means their platform can seamlessly perform complex tasks that legacy systems struggle with, such as intelligently organizing leads and automating highly personalized follow-up emails. This native AI capability provides a significant competitive edge, allowing Conversion to offer truly enriched contact management and automated workf",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ai-marketing-startup-funding/,BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|BTC,AI News|AI|Conversion|Funding|Marketing Automation|Startups,BTC,"Revolutionary AI Marketing Automation: How Two Dropouts Secured $28 Million in Startup Funding.

Navigating the Tech Entrepreneurship Landscape The journey of tech entrepreneurship is dynamic, requiring founders to adapt quickly to evolving technological landscapes. Conversion’s development coincided with the explosive rise of generative AI, particularly the emergence of ChatGPT. This presented both a challenge and an immense opportunity.

2025-07-30 16:04:45+00:00,Florida Sheriff told by the court to return over $700k seized crypto,"Law enforcement authorities in Volusia County, Florida, have been told by the court to return over $700,000 in cryptocurrency and paid legal fees. The federal officers improperly handled the seizure of assets from a European Union-licensed brokerage firm, according to a public statement issued Tuesday by the Sammis Law Firm. The law firm mentioned that the incident involved a $20,000 fraud investigation that began in Waupaca County, Wisconsin. Law enforcement authorities tracked the fraud proceeds to a Kraken crypto exchange account belonging to a legitimate brokerage business. Despite the company’s full cooperation and transparency throughout the investigation, the Kraken account was frozen on March 28, 2025. At the time of the freeze, the account held over $450,000 in crypto, an amount that rose in value to more than $700,000 in the following weeks. On April 9, the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office secured a sealed seizure warrant instructing Kraken to liquidate 1.19121 BTC into US dollars and transfer the proceeds to a law enforcement-controlled wallet. Client tries to clarify mistaken identity In the days that followed, the brokerage attempted to obtain more details from Kraken about the conditions of the account freeze. On April 3, 2025, Kraken finally confirmed it was frozen due to a transaction ID flagged by Volusia County Detective Kincaid. The client used this information to identify the customer linked to the transaction and sent documentation to authorities to assist in identifying the real perpetrator of the fraud . On April 10, the brokerage provided additional corporate records and structural details to support its case. Detective Kincaid listed the specific BTC transaction ID that was the subject of concern and issued a copy of a Bitcoin purchase slip for 0.16196522 BTC, valued at $20,000, supposedly tied to the fraud. However, the transaction initially flagged and traced to the client’s wallet involved approximately 0.93 BTC, significantly more than the suspected fraudulent transaction. By April 15, the company had also been contacted by a detective in Volusia County conducting a separate fraud investigation linked to the same wallet address. The firm responded by providing a data package and requesting a video call to clarify the case. Kraken insists that it had complied with both orders, but admitted it did not disclose this information to the client until after the funds had been transferred to law enforcement. Forfeiture process lacked legal basis, attorney says The law firm representing the brokerage contends the seizure did not follow any of the necessary procedures outlined in Florida’s Contraband Forfeiture Act. According to the firm, nothing was ever filed with the clerk’s office, and the judge who signed the seizure warrant lacked subject matter jurisdiction to do so. Additionally, the law enforcement officer executing the order had no legal authority to serve a seizure warrant outside of his jurisdiction. Attorney Leslie Sammis also mentioned that no formal notice of seizure was created or provided to the brokerage, even though the company had fully cooperated with investigators and shared all necessary contact details. Public records request filed Following the reimbursement of the crypto, the law firm filed a formal public records request under Chapter 119 of the Florida Statutes. The request asked the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office to produce documents related to the seizure, including any other seizure warrants involving the assets that were directed to the agency. The request also sought documents that would show any blockchain tracing included with the affidavit supporting the seizure warrant, and any records illustrating the tracing process itself. In addition, the firm asked for service returns, inventories of seized assets, any correspondence or responses related to the seizure warrant, and all records connected to the disposition or sale of the property. Specifically, the firm requested a full account of what happened to the funds taken from the brokerage’s Kraken account.

2025-07-30 16:05:10+00:00,Monumental Bitcoin Whale Transfer Rocks Coinbase: What It Means for Investors,"BitcoinWorld Monumental Bitcoin Whale Transfer Rocks Coinbase: What It Means for Investors In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, certain events capture attention more than others. One such occurrence recently sent ripples through the market: a monumental Bitcoin whale transfer . Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracking service, reported a significant movement of 7,625 BTC from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an unknown new wallet. Valued at approximately $904 million at the time of the transaction, this single move instantly became a focal point of discussion among traders, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. What does such a colossal transaction signify, and what implications does a Bitcoin whale transfer hold for the broader market? Understanding the Giants: What is a Bitcoin Whale Transfer ? Before diving into the specifics of this particular event, it’s crucial to understand the terminology. In the crypto lexicon, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a vast amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their buying or selling activities. A ‘whale transfer’ is simply the movement of a large sum of cryptocurrency from one wallet to another, often triggering speculation about their intentions. Definition of a Whale: While there’s no official threshold, generally, anyone holding over 1,000 BTC is considered a Bitcoin whale. These entities often include early adopters, institutional investors, exchanges, or even large funds. Why They Matter: The sheer volume of their holdings means their actions can create significant price volatility. A large sale could trigger a market downturn, while a large accumulation might signal bullish sentiment. Role of Whale Alert: Services like Whale Alert track these massive transactions across various blockchains, providing transparency and real-time insights into the movements of these large holders. Deconstructing the $904 Million Move: The Coinbase Exodus The recent transfer involved 7,625 BTC originating from Coinbase, a U.S.-based exchange known for its high liquidity and institutional client base. The destination? An ‘unknown new wallet’. This detail is particularly significant, as the nature of the receiving wallet often provides clues about the whale’s intentions. Source (Coinbase): Transfers from exchanges like Coinbase can indicate several things. It could be an institutional client moving funds to cold storage, an over-the-counter (OTC) deal being settled, or even an internal rebalancing by the exchange itself, though the latter is less common for such a specific amount to an ‘unknown new wallet’. Destination (Unknown New Wallet): The ‘unknown’ aspect means the wallet address has no public association with an exchange, known institution, or custodial service. This often points towards private cold storage, a newly created wallet for a specific purpose, or an OTC desk’s receiving address. Value Proposition: At nearly a billion dollars, this Bitcoin whale transfer is not just a routine transaction; it’s a statement of significant capital movement, demanding attention from market observers. What Motivates a Bitcoin Whale Transfer ? Exploring the Possibilities When such a substantial amount of Bitcoin moves, the crypto community immediately begins to speculate on the ‘why’. There are several common reasons for a large Bitcoin whale transfer : 1. Enhanced Security (Cold Storage): One of the most common and often bullish interpretations is that the whale is moving funds from an exchange (hot wallet) to a private, offline cold storage wallet. This is done for maximum security, protecting assets from potential exchange hacks or regulatory risks. It suggests a long-term holding strategy, as moving funds out of an exchange makes them less readily available for immediate sale. 2. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Large institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals often execute trades through OTC desks to avoid impacting market prices. If a large buyer acquires BTC via an OTC deal, the seller might transfer the Bitcoin from an exchange to the buyer’s designated wallet. This transaction is typically private and doesn’t appear on public order books, making it a common reason for large, seemingly unexplained transfers. 3. Preparing for Sale (Exchange Deposit): Conversely, if the funds were moved to an exchange from an unknown wallet, it might signal an intent to sell. However, in this case, the movement was from an exchange, which generally points away from an immediate sell-off. 4. Portfolio Rebalancing or Custodial Shifts: Large entities, including investment funds or corporate treasuries, frequently rebalance their portfolios or shift assets between different custodial solutions. This could involve moving funds between different types of wallets or even between different custodians for diversification or strategic reasons. 5. Internal Transfers: While less likely for a specific amount to an ‘unknown ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-whale-transfer-impact/,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS,Crypto News|BITCOIN|BTC Transfer|COINBASE|crypto whales|Market Analysis,BTC,"Monumental Bitcoin Whale Transfer Rocks Coinbase: What It Means for Investors.

The report offers the most comprehensive outline of President Donald Trump''s crypto push to date, covering all the major and minor policy efforts underway this year. For an industry that''s been following each of those closely, however, it doesn''t offer revelations of new initiatives or go into a deep explanation of individual policy pursuits. Senior administration officials said on Wednesday that it''s meant as a guidepost against which the government''s progress can be measured. So far, the progress has been considerable when compared with the administration of former President Joe Biden. A new law, the GENIUS Act, already demands regulations to govern U.S. stablecoin issuers, and an even bigger piece of legislation to set up rules for the wider crypto markets, known in the House as the Clarity Act, has cleared the House of Representatives and is underway in the Senate. But in the report, Trump''s earlier call for crypto stockpiles — one for bitcoin (BTC) and another for all other digital assets — only made the last page of the report, where the initiative was broadly summarized without the detail that wasn''t offered before. One of the officials said the infrastructure is well underway for that project and that there will be more information soon. Bo Hines, one of Trump''s top crypto advisers, had suggested earlier this month that the president''s executive order calling for the reserves had required a report on the process but that the administration wasn''t yet making it public and may choose not to. The lack of specifics had many crypto observers hoping the plans might be further revealed in this week''s more comprehensive document. The industry''s stakes remain high on that project, which had initially disappointed many observers by promising a fund built only on assets organically seized by government agencies, but that also hinted at the administration''s desire to find other ways to fund it. Lawmakers in Congress may also play a part by working on legislation that reinforces the process. Senator Cynthia Lummis has been in the vanguard of that with her Boosting Innovation, Technology, and Competitiveness through Optimized Investment Nationwide (BITCOIN) Act, but it hasn''t yet moved. A call to action Meanwhile, Wednesday''s report could be read by sitting U.S. regulators as a call to action. The group of regulators who agreed on its content ""encourages the Federal government to operationalize President Trump’s promise to make America the ''crypto capital of the world'' and adopt a pro-innovation mindset toward digital assets and blockchain technologies,"" the report said. More specifically, its core recommendations suggest that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ""should use their existing authorities to immediately enable the trading of digital assets at the federal level."" That''s a push to get started with regulation even as Congress produces its market structure work, and though the CFTC still lacks a permanent leadership under Trump, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins has suggested his agency has the authorities to act that he''s been exploring . The report also included a tax section that echoes a number of the ideas also pushed by Senator Lummis, the chair of the Senate Banking Committee''s subcommittee on digital assets.
