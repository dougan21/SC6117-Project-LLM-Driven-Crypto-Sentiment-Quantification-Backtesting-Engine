2025-07-23 03:45:18+00:00,Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy: DDC Unveils Ambitious $500M Plan for Crypto Dominance,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy: DDC Unveils Ambitious $500M Plan for Crypto Dominance In a bold move that has sent ripples across both the e-commerce and cryptocurrency sectors, DDC Enterprise, a prominent NYSE-listed e-commerce platform, has officially declared its ambitious intentions to significantly ramp up its Bitcoin holdings. This isn’t just another corporate investment; it’s a strategic declaration of intent, signaling a profound belief in the future of digital assets. At the heart of this strategy is the filing of a substantial $500 million F-3 shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a pivotal step designed to fuel their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy . What’s Driving DDC’s Bold Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy? Why would a well-established e-commerce giant like DDC pivot so strongly towards Bitcoin? The answer lies in a confluence of factors that are reshaping global financial strategies. Companies worldwide are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin not merely as a speculative asset, but as a robust store of value and a hedge against inflation. For DDC, this strategic shift is about future-proofing their balance sheet and diversifying their corporate treasury in an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and economic uncertainty. Their goal is clear: to accumulate 10,000 BTC by the end of the year and solidify their position as one of the top three Bitcoin treasury companies within three years. This aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy reflects a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term potential as a foundational asset in the digital economy. The Mechanics Behind DDC’s $500M F-3 Shelf Registration: How It Fuels Bitcoin Holdings Understanding the financial instrument behind DDC’s monumental plan is key to grasping its potential impact. An F-3 shelf registration statement is essentially a filing with the SEC that allows a company to register securities for future issuance ‘off the shelf’ over a period of up to three years. This provides DDC with immense flexibility to raise capital through various offerings—such as common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or warrants—without having to file a new prospectus for each individual offering. Think of it as pre-approving a line of credit that can be drawn upon as needed. For DDC, this $500 million facility is specifically earmarked to accelerate their Bitcoin accumulation strategy . It provides the necessary financial muscle to execute large-scale purchases of BTC, allowing them to capitalize on market opportunities and build their digital asset reserves efficiently. This mechanism underscores a sophisticated approach to funding their ambitious crypto ventures, ensuring they have the liquidity to become a significant player in the Bitcoin treasury space. Why Aim for 10,000 BTC? DDC’s Vision for a Leading Bitcoin Treasury The target of accumulating 10,000 BTC by year-end is not arbitrary; it’s a strategic benchmark that would place DDC among the elite ranks of public companies holding substantial Bitcoin reserves. Currently, companies like MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital Holdings, and Tesla lead the pack. Company Approx. BTC Holdings (as of recent reports) Primary Business MicroStrategy ~214,400 BTC Business Intelligence Software Marathon Digital Holdings ~17,800 BTC Bitcoin Mining Tesla ~9,720 BTC Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy DDC Enterprise (Target) 10,000 BTC E-commerce Platform DDC’s ambition to join the top three Bitcoin treasury companies within three years signifies a profound belief in Bitcoin’s future as a global reserve asset. This isn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about integrating it into their core financial strategy, potentially leveraging it for future growth, or even using it as collateral. This aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy demonstrates DDC’s forward-thinking approach, aiming to capture the upside potential of a decentralized digital economy while hedging against traditional financial risks. Navigating the Landscape: Challenges and Opportunities in Bitcoin Accumulation While DDC’s Bitcoin accumulation strategy presents immense opportunities, it also comes with its share of challenges. The inherent volatility of Bitcoin is a primary concern. Its price can fluctuate wildly, impacting the value of DDC’s treasury holdings. However, for companies like DDC adopting a long-term ‘hodl’ strategy, short-term price swings are often viewed as temporary noise rather than fundamental threats. Another significant challenge is the evolving regulatory landscape. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to classify and regulate cryptocurrencies, which could introduce uncertainties for corporate holders. Security is paramount; safeguarding such substantial digital assets requires state-of-the-art cybersecurity measures and robust internal protocols to prevent hacks or loss.

2025-07-23 03:50:23+00:00,Bitcoin’s Ambitious Ascent: Why Glassnode Cautions on the $200K Price Prediction,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Ambitious Ascent: Why Glassnode Cautions on the $200K Price Prediction The cryptocurrency world is constantly buzzing with predictions, especially when it comes to Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets. From sky-high targets to cautious forecasts, everyone wants to know where Bitcoin is headed next. While many enthusiasts dream of a rapid surge past previous all-time highs, a leading voice from the analytics firm Glassnode offers a more grounded perspective on the ambitious Bitcoin price prediction of reaching $200,000 in the near future. This nuanced view invites us to look beyond the hype and understand the intricate market dynamics at play. Glassnode’s Cautious Outlook on Bitcoin Price Prediction James Check, a prominent lead analyst at Glassnode, recently shared insights that temper the widespread optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s immediate price trajectory. In an interview on the YouTube channel “Less Noise More Signal,” cited by Cointelegraph, Check articulated why a rapid ascent to the $200,000 mark in 2025 appears unlikely based on current market conditions. His analysis highlights a critical factor: the existing buying volume simply isn’t robust enough to sustain such a monumental rally. This isn’t a bearish call but rather a realistic assessment of the market’s current momentum. Check’s perspective emphasizes that reaching specific price points is only half the battle. Establishing firm and stable support at these levels is equally, if not more, important. He specifically pointed to several key milestones that Bitcoin must not only touch but also consolidate above: $130,000: A significant psychological and technical barrier. $140,000: Building on the momentum from the previous level. $150,000: A crucial test of sustained buying pressure and investor confidence. The analyst’s warning is clear: without strong, stable support built at these intermediate levels, any swift price increase could be followed by an equally sharp and potentially damaging decline. This underscores the difference between a speculative spike and a sustainable, healthy market trend. Understanding this nuance is vital for anyone interested in the future of Bitcoin price prediction . Understanding the Mechanics Behind Bitcoin Price Prediction What exactly does “weak buying volume” signify in the context of Bitcoin price prediction ? In simple terms, it means that while there might be interest in Bitcoin, the collective purchasing power and conviction of buyers are not strong enough to absorb potential selling pressure at higher price points. This can lead to a lack of momentum and makes it difficult for Bitcoin to break through significant resistance levels convincingly. Several factors contribute to robust or weak buying volume, helping demystify market movements: Retail vs. Institutional Demand: While retail investors contribute, large institutional players often provide the necessary capital for sustained rallies. Their current appetite significantly impacts overall volume. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical events can influence investor risk appetite, diverting capital. Market Liquidity: High liquidity means plenty of buyers and sellers, easing large trades without drastic price impact. Weak volume often correlates with lower liquidity. On-Chain Metrics: Glassnode tracks blockchain data like active addresses, transaction volume, and exchange flows, providing deep insights into genuine market activity versus speculative noise. The emphasis on “establishing firm footing” highlights the importance of consolidation phases. These periods allow for price discovery, accumulation by strong hands, and the building of support zones. Without them, a rapid pump often results in a rapid dump, leaving many investors caught off guard. This is a crucial lesson for anyone looking at long-term Bitcoin price prediction models. Navigating Key Milestones on Bitcoin’s Journey: A Practical Bitcoin Price Prediction Approach The levels of $130,000, $140,000, and $150,000 are not arbitrary figures. They represent significant psychological barriers and potential resistance points that Bitcoin has not yet confidently overcome. For Bitcoin to truly embark on a sustained journey towards $200,000 and beyond, it needs to demonstrate its ability to not only touch these levels but to hold them, turning old resistance into new support. This process involves: Testing Resistance: Price approaches a key level, and sellers emerge, pushing the price back down. Breaking Through: Strong buying pressure overcomes the selling pressure, and the price moves above the resistance. Re-testing Support: The price often pulls back to the newly breached level, which now acts as support. If it holds, it confirms the strength of the move. Consolidation: The price trades within a relatively narrow range above the new support, allowing for further accumulation and preparing for the next leg up.",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-prediction-200k/,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN,Crypto News|#Glassnode|BITCOIN|Crypto Market|Market Analysis|Price Forecast,BTC,"Bitcoin’s Ambitious Ascent: Why Glassnode Cautions on the $200K Price Prediction.

2025-07-23 03:55:49+00:00,Bitcoin Shows Near-term Fragility as Investors Shift to Altcoins: Bitfinex,"Since hitting its all-time high (ATH) over a week ago, bitcoin has been consolidating. Analysts at the crypto exchange Bitfinex say the asset’s structural strength remains intact; however, the bull market is entering a more delicate and reactive phase. According to the weekly Bitfinex Alpha report , the market is seeing a natural rotation between bitcoin holder cohorts. While this capital rotation reflects a maturing cycle, BTC faces the risk of near-term fragility, especially if demand weakens. Bitcoin Faces Near-term Fragility For the first time since early 2024, long-term bitcoin holders have begun to distribute their holdings and lock in profits. This cohort of investors has already started to send more BTC to exchanges and newer wallets. As they sell their assets, newer market participants, including exchange-traded funds (ETFs), institutional buyers, and retail investors, are buying and absorbing the supply. Bitfinex said ETFs and bitcoin treasury companies account for a significant portion of the purchases. This rotation from long-term to short-term holders is a common feature of every bull cycle. However, the strength of spot demand will determine whether BTC will enter a cooling period or experience another rally. Currently, on-chain data shows that the majority of the BTC supply is now held in profit. Bitcoin’s spot price has climbed above the 95th percentile level, indicating a sharp increase in the number of investors sitting on unrealized profits. Such dynamics often trigger high profit-taking from short-term holders and opportunistic investors. Subsequently, the market sees a redistribution of supply to new buyers at higher prices. This could drive a short-term bitcoin uptrend, but weaken the market structure and increase the cost basis. Bitfinex insists that sharp price drops could lead to broader declines in such environments. This increases the risk of volatility and corrective phases, especially if buyer momentum fades. Altcoins Are Surging With bitcoin cooling off now, altcoins are witnessing what analysts called “an aggressive catch-up rally.” Investors are now reallocating their capital from BTC to large-cap altcoins in pursuit of additional gains. Many major altcoins are outperforming BTC for the first time since November 2024, with ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL) leading the charge. The Others Index, a metric that tracks the performance of cryptocurrencies, excluding stablecoins and the top 10 assets by market capitalization, has surged by at least 35% in two weeks, adding almost $85 billion. Additionally, bitcoin’s dominance has declined by 6.9%, marking seven consecutive daily declines for the first time since December 2023.

2025-07-23 04:00:25+00:00,Institutional Ethereum Holdings: An Unprecedented Surge Past $7 Billion,"BitcoinWorld Institutional Ethereum Holdings: An Unprecedented Surge Past $7 Billion Imagine a financial world where major players, from hedge funds to asset managers, are not just dipping their toes but are diving headfirst into the digital asset space. That future is increasingly becoming our present, especially when it comes to Ethereum. Recent data from Strategic Ethereum Reserve reveals a monumental milestone: institutional Ethereum holdings have officially surpassed an astonishing $7 billion. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful signal, representing 1.87 million ETH, or approximately 1.55% of the total ETH supply. This significant accumulation by large-scale investors speaks volumes about the growing confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value and its pivotal role in the evolving digital economy. What’s Behind the Remarkable Growth in Institutional Ethereum Holdings? So, what exactly is attracting these financial giants to Ethereum? It’s a combination of factors that highlight Ethereum’s unique position in the blockchain ecosystem. Understanding these drivers helps us appreciate the depth of this institutional commitment: Ethereum’s Ecosystem Appeal: Ethereum isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s the foundational layer for a vast array of decentralized applications (dApps), including the booming sectors of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Institutions recognize the immense potential of this programmable blockchain, seeing it as the internet’s next evolution rather than just a digital currency. The Merge and Staking Rewards: The successful transition of Ethereum to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, often referred to as ‘The Merge,’ was a game-changer. It made Ethereum more energy-efficient and, crucially, introduced staking. Institutions can now stake their ETH to earn yield, offering a predictable revenue stream that aligns with traditional investment strategies. This yield-generating capability makes institutional Ethereum holdings far more attractive than simply holding a non-productive asset. Maturing Regulatory Landscape: While still evolving, the regulatory environment around cryptocurrencies is slowly but surely gaining clarity. As more jurisdictions develop frameworks for digital assets, institutional investors find it easier to navigate the compliance challenges, reducing perceived risks associated with large-scale crypto investments. Diversification from Bitcoin: For a long time, Bitcoin was the sole focus for institutional crypto adoption. However, as the market matures, institutions are looking to diversify their digital asset portfolios. Ethereum, with its distinct use cases and economic model, offers a compelling alternative and complement to Bitcoin, making it a natural choice for expanding their institutional Ethereum holdings . The Market Impact: How Institutional Ethereum Holdings Reshape the Crypto Landscape The influx of institutional capital into Ethereum isn’t just good news for ETH holders; it has far-reaching implications for the entire crypto market. This trend signifies a profound shift, moving cryptocurrencies from the fringes of finance to a more central position. Increased Legitimacy and Mainstream Acceptance: When large financial institutions commit billions to an asset, it sends a powerful message. It signals that Ethereum is a serious, legitimate asset class, capable of being integrated into traditional financial portfolios. This helps to erode skepticism and builds broader public and corporate trust. Enhanced Liquidity and Reduced Volatility: Institutional investors typically trade in large volumes, which can significantly increase market liquidity. Greater liquidity often leads to reduced price volatility, making Ethereum a more stable and attractive asset for a wider range of investors, both retail and institutional. Potential for New Financial Products: The growing interest in institutional Ethereum holdings could pave the way for more regulated financial products like Ethereum ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) in various jurisdictions. These products would further lower barriers to entry for traditional investors, funneling even more capital into the ecosystem. Shift in Market Dynamics: Historically, the crypto market has been heavily influenced by retail sentiment. While retail remains crucial, the increasing presence of institutions means market dynamics will likely become more aligned with traditional financial markets, where fundamental analysis and long-term strategies play a more dominant role. Benefits and Challenges of Institutional Ethereum Adoption While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge the potential challenges that come with such significant institutional involvement: Benefits Challenges Market Stability: Large holdings can absorb volatility.

2025-07-23 04:15:18+00:00,Bitcoin Short Shock: Whale Investor Unleashes Massive $200M Bet Against BTC,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Short Shock: Whale Investor Unleashes Massive $200M Bet Against BTC The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with news that could send ripples across the market. A prominent whale investor, known on X as @Jason60704294, has reportedly initiated a colossal Bitcoin short position, valued at over $200 million. This isn’t just a casual trade; it’s a high-stakes maneuver that has captivated the attention of traders, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. With a substantial margin of $36.2 million, an entry price of $119,425.23, and a liquidation price set at $133,678.54, this daring bet against Bitcoin’s immediate upward trajectory has opened up a fascinating discussion about market sentiment, risk, and the immense power of whale activity. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Short , Anyway? Before diving deeper into the implications of such a massive trade, it’s crucial to understand the mechanics behind a Bitcoin short position. In essence, short selling is a trading strategy where an investor speculates on the decline in an asset’s price. It’s the opposite of the more common ‘long’ position, where investors buy an asset hoping its price will rise. Borrow and Sell: When you short an asset like Bitcoin, you first borrow it from a broker. You then immediately sell that borrowed Bitcoin at the current market price. Buy Back and Return: The goal is to buy back the same amount of Bitcoin later at a lower price. Once bought, you return the borrowed Bitcoin to the broker, pocketing the difference between the initial selling price and the lower repurchase price. Margin Trading: This particular Bitcoin short involves margin. Margin trading allows traders to borrow funds from a broker to increase their trading capital, amplifying potential profits (and losses). The $36.2 million margin acts as collateral for the $200 million position, indicating a significant leverage ratio. Liquidation Price: The liquidation price ($133,678.54 in this case) is a critical threshold. If Bitcoin’s price rises to this level, the investor’s position will be automatically closed by the exchange to prevent further losses that exceed their margin. This means the initial margin collateral would be lost. This strategy is inherently risky because, unlike going long (where losses are limited to your initial investment), potential losses on a short position are theoretically unlimited. If Bitcoin’s price were to skyrocket indefinitely, the short seller would continue to lose money. Why Would a Whale Place Such a Large Bitcoin Short Bet? The decision by a whale to open a multi-million dollar Bitcoin short isn’t made lightly. Such a move usually stems from a strong conviction about the asset’s future price action. Several factors could motivate such a significant bearish bet: Bearish Market Outlook: The most straightforward reason is a belief that Bitcoin’s price is due for a significant correction or sustained downtrend. This could be based on technical analysis, fundamental shifts in the crypto landscape, or broader macroeconomic concerns. Hedging Strategy: It’s possible the whale holds a substantial amount of Bitcoin in their long-term portfolio and is using this short position as a hedge. A hedge is like an insurance policy; if the price of their existing Bitcoin holdings drops, the profits from the short position could offset those losses. Anticipation of Negative News: Whales often have access to information or insights before it becomes public. They might be anticipating regulatory crackdowns, major exchange hacks, or other negative news that could depress Bitcoin’s value. Exploiting Market Weakness: If the whale perceives a lack of strong buying pressure or an overextended market, they might see an opportunity to profit from a downward move. They might believe that current prices are unsustainable. Liquidity Play: In some cases, very large players might open positions to influence market sentiment or liquidity, though this treads into complex and sometimes regulated territory. Regardless of the specific motivation, this whale is betting big on a decline from Bitcoin’s current high valuation, expecting it to fall significantly from its $119,425.23 entry point. How Does Whale Activity Influence the Bitcoin Market ? The actions of ‘whales’ – individuals or entities holding massive amounts of cryptocurrency – are closely watched in the crypto market. Their large trades can create significant price movements and influence market sentiment. When a whale opens a substantial Bitcoin short , it can have several effects: Immediate Market Reaction: Increased Volatility: The sheer size of a $200 million position can inject volatility into the market. Other traders might react by adjusting their own positions, leading to rapid price swings. Sentiment Shift: News of a major short can spark bearish sentiment.

Among the most challenging hurdles faced by affected individuals, particularly for FTX creditors , has been the complex issue of jurisdiction. For months, the specter of exclusion loomed large for users in certain regions, threatening to cut them off from any potential restitution. However, recent developments from the ongoing FTX bankruptcy hearing have cast a powerful new light of hope on this grim situation. What’s the Latest Breakthrough for FTX Creditors? The crypto community, especially the beleaguered FTX creditors , has been closely following every update from the bankruptcy proceedings. A significant turning point emerged from a recent post on X by @historian_ftx, an account widely believed to be an FTX creditor themselves, providing crucial insights from the latest hearing. This update signals a potentially game-changing shift for those previously left in limbo due to their geographical location. At the heart of this breakthrough is an updated motion that aims to significantly scale back or even entirely remove a contentious clause. This clause previously allowed for the immediate forfeiture of claims based solely on a creditor’s jurisdiction at the time of the exchange’s collapse. Imagine the relief for thousands of FTX creditors who might have believed their claims were effectively nullified by an accident of geography. The implications are profound: Flexibility in Location: Creditors who completed their Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements in what are now considered restricted countries (such as China or potentially Russia) may no longer be permanently barred from receiving distributions. Relocation Option: Crucially, these FTX creditors may now be permitted to relocate to non-restricted jurisdictions, like the crypto-friendly hubs of Singapore or the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and still qualify for their rightful distributions. Dynamic Jurisdiction: This clarifies a vital point: jurisdiction is not irrevocably locked at the moment of a snapshot or initial claim filing. Instead, it can be updated and verified closer to the actual distribution phase. This offers a lifeline to users who, for instance, might have been traveling or residing elsewhere but used a restricted country’s address for their initial KYC. This positive development directly addresses concerns that arose after a July 2 court filing in the FTX bankruptcy case, which listed 49 countries and regions where users might be excluded from compensation. For many FTX creditors , this felt like an unjust punishment for circumstances beyond their control. The new motion offers a path forward, prioritizing restitution over rigid geographical constraints. How Will This Impact FTX Creditors in Restricted Regions? The news is a beacon for thousands of FTX creditors who felt their claims were dead in the water. For those in countries like China, where crypto activities face stringent regulations, or Russia, grappling with international sanctions, this update offers a tangible path to recovery. Let’s explore the multifaceted impact this development is expected to have: Benefits for Affected FTX Creditors: Access to Distributions: The most immediate and significant benefit is the potential for previously excluded users to finally access their share of the recovered funds. This is a fundamental step towards fairness and equity in the bankruptcy process. Increased Flexibility: It provides much-needed flexibility for individuals whose residency or citizenship status might have changed since the FTX collapse, or for those who initially registered with an address in a restricted country but primarily reside elsewhere. Reduced Legal Uncertainty: By clarifying the dynamic nature of jurisdiction, the new motion helps reduce the immense legal uncertainty that has plagued many FTX creditors . It provides a clearer framework for qualification. Potential for Higher Recovery Rates: While counterintuitive, allowing more claimants to participate can sometimes lead to a more efficient and less litigious distribution process overall, potentially speeding up recoveries for all FTX creditors . Challenges and Considerations for FTX Creditors: While the news is overwhelmingly positive, it’s crucial for FTX creditors to understand that the path forward still involves complexities. Relocating to a new jurisdiction, even for the purpose of claiming funds, is not a trivial undertaking. Consider the following: Logistical Hurdles: Establishing residency in a new country involves significant logistical planning, including visa applications, housing, and potentially new bank accounts.

2025-07-23 04:30:28+00:00,Bitcoin Hovers Below $120K as On-Chain Indicators Point to Slowing Demand,"Bitcoin’s price remains in a zone where it is seeing little upward momentum as it continues to hover below its recent all-time high. After reaching above $123,000 earlier this month, the asset has pulled back slightly, trading at $119,343 at the time of writing. This represents a 2% gain over the past week but still leaves BTC roughly 3% below its recent peak. The muted price action reflects a market that appears to be consolidating amid diverging signals from on-chain indicators and regional demand metrics. Recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributors points to a weakening appetite for Bitcoin in both the US and South Korea, two markets that have historically contributed significant trading volume. A closer look at exchange activity and regional pricing premiums suggests a potential shift in investor behavior, as profit-taking becomes more prominent and traders appear hesitant to buy at current levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? Regional Premiums Point to Lower Demand from US and South Korea According to a post by CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain, the Coinbase Premium Index, which measures the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other global exchanges, has failed to climb significantly despite BTC reaching record highs in July. The index remained around levels seen in June, suggesting that US investors using Coinbase have not been aggressively buying Bitcoin during the rally. Arab Chain noted that the index’s movement toward negative territory alongside Bitcoin’s price increase may indicate profit-taking among American investors. This implies that some may be anticipating a correction before re-entering the market. Similarly, the Korea Premium Index has declined, signaling reduced demand from retail investors in South Korea. This index reflects the spread between Bitcoin’s price on Korean exchanges and global averages. The negative trend suggests Korean traders have been selling below the global average, with weak buying interest on local platforms. Arab Chain interprets this as retail traders possibly waiting for a discount to reenter the market, indicating caution among individual investors in Asia’s key crypto hub. Exchange Inflows Suggest Rising Sell Pressure Adding to the picture, another CryptoQuant contributor, ShayanMarkets, highlighted a notable development in BTC’s on-chain activity. The latest data reveals Bitcoin has experienced its largest net inflow to exchanges since July 2024. Typically, large inflows signal that holders are preparing to sell, increasing supply on trading platforms and contributing to potential downward price pressure. ShayanMarkets explained that this behavior, especially when occurring near all-time highs, may indicate institutional or fund-driven profit-taking. Such moves often align with efforts to reduce risk exposure during overextended market rallies. Historically, spikes in exchange inflows have been followed by price corrections, making this a trend to monitor closely. Related Reading: Bitcoin Holders Are Taking Profits—But Is the Top Still Far Away? However, the redistribution of capital from Bitcoin into other assets may benefit the broader crypto market. The analyst noted that altcoins could see renewed interest as funds rotate out of BTC.

Arab Chain interprets this as retail traders possibly waiting for a discount to reenter the market, indicating caution among individual investors in Asia’s key crypto hub. Exchange Inflows Suggest Rising Sell Pressure Adding to the picture, another CryptoQuant contributor, ShayanMarkets, highlighted a notable development in BTC’s on-chain activity. The latest data reveals Bitcoin has experienced its largest net inflow to exchanges since July 2024. Typically, large inflows signal that holders are preparing to sell, increasing supply on trading platforms and contributing to potential downward price pressure. ShayanMarkets explained that this behavior, especially when occurring near all-time highs, may indicate institutional or fund-driven profit-taking. Such moves often align with efforts to reduce risk exposure during overextended market rallies. Historically, spikes in exchange inflows have been followed by price corrections, making this a trend to monitor closely.

The analyst noted that altcoins could see renewed interest as funds rotate out of BTC. If the trend continues, traders may observe increased volatility and speculative movement across alternative tokens in the short term. Featured image created with DALL-E, Chart from TradingView"
2025-07-23 04:40:24+00:00,SEALSQ Unveils Strategic $30M Crypto Treasury for Post-Quantum Cryptography Advancement,"BitcoinWorld SEALSQ Unveils Strategic $30M Crypto Treasury for Post-Quantum Cryptography Advancement In a groundbreaking move set to redefine the intersection of cybersecurity and digital finance, SEALSQ, a Nasdaq-listed firm renowned for its robust cybersecurity solutions, has announced the launch of a formidable $30 million cryptocurrency treasury fund. This bold initiative isn’t just about accumulating digital assets; it’s a strategic investment aimed at bolstering the company’s pioneering efforts in post-quantum cryptography and advancing its broader blockchain initiatives. For anyone tracking the evolution of secure digital ecosystems, this development signals a significant leap forward, blending traditional corporate finance with the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies to address future security challenges. SEALSQ’s Bold Move: A Strategic Investment in the Future of Post-Quantum Cryptography SEALSQ’s decision to establish a dedicated crypto treasury is a clear indicator of its commitment to innovation and foresight in an increasingly complex digital landscape. According to a GlobeNewswire press release, this $30 million fund is earmarked specifically to support the development and deployment of next-generation security protocols that can withstand the computational power of future quantum computers. But what exactly does this mean for the crypto world and beyond? The fund’s investment strategy is diversified, targeting both established giants and emerging players in the digital asset space. The portfolio includes: Bitcoin (BTC): The undisputed king of cryptocurrencies, offering stability and broad acceptance. Ethereum (ETH): The leading platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, crucial for blockchain innovation. Hedera (HBAR): Known for its enterprise-grade distributed ledger technology, offering high performance and security. SEALSQ-affiliated tokens (QAIT and WeCan): These tokens likely play a pivotal role within SEALSQ’s own ecosystem, potentially fueling their specific blockchain or cybersecurity projects. This mix highlights a calculated approach: leveraging the liquidity and brand recognition of major cryptocurrencies while simultaneously nurturing proprietary projects that align directly with SEALSQ’s strategic objectives in post-quantum cryptography and blockchain development. It’s a testament to the growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies not just as speculative assets, but as legitimate tools for corporate treasury management and strategic funding. Understanding Post-Quantum Cryptography : Why It Matters Now To truly grasp the significance of SEALSQ’s investment, one must understand the looming threat that post-quantum cryptography aims to mitigate. In simple terms, quantum computers, once fully realized, will possess the ability to break many of the encryption methods that secure our digital lives today. This includes everything from online banking and secure communications to blockchain transactions and national security infrastructure. Imagine a future where your encrypted messages, financial transactions, and even the very foundations of blockchain (which relies heavily on cryptographic hashes) could be compromised by a sufficiently powerful quantum computer. This isn’t science fiction; it’s a projected reality that cybersecurity experts are actively preparing for. The development of quantum-resistant algorithms, or post-quantum cryptography (PQC), is therefore a race against time. SEALSQ, with its deep roots in cybersecurity, is positioning itself at the forefront of this race. Their $30 million treasury isn’t merely an investment in crypto; it’s an investment in the foundational security of tomorrow’s digital world. By funding PQC research and implementation, they are working to ensure that digital assets, secure communications, and blockchain technologies remain impenetrable even in a quantum-dominated era. Beyond Bitcoin: The Diverse Portfolio Powering Innovation Why did SEALSQ choose this specific mix of cryptocurrencies for its treasury? The decision to include BTC, ETH, and HBAR alongside their proprietary tokens, QAIT and WeCan, reflects a nuanced understanding of the crypto market and its potential synergies with cybersecurity: Table: SEALSQ’s Crypto Treasury Allocations – Strategic Rationale Asset Strategic Rationale Relevance to PQC/Blockchain Bitcoin (BTC) Digital Gold, Store of Value, Liquidity Benchmark for future secure digital assets; high market cap for treasury stability.

2025-07-23 05:00:16+00:00,Bitcoin Momentum Rebuilds — TON and SUI Hit Technical Buy Zones,"Bitcoin has officially reclaimed center stage, crossing the $118,000 mark for the first time in history. Fueled by a record-setting short squeeze and ETF inflows, the breakout is triggering capital shifts across the market. SUI and Toncoin are showing signs of strength—but it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE, a decentralized political memecoin, that’s quietly entering buy-zone discussions among early-stage investors looking for high-conviction narratives in the next altcoin wave. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Political Altcoin Narrative Enters Buy-Zone Phase While BTC, SUI, and TON dominate headlines, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making noise where it matters—wallets, volume, and forums. The meme-powered altcoin recently passed $11.2 million raised with over 5,234 verified holders. But what’s attracting fresh attention is the breakout behavior: weekly volume is up 320%, and 1,500+ new wallets were created in under 48 hours. MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t riding ETF news or protocol upgrades—it’s leading with ideological clarity. As a decentralized political memecoin, its zero-tax model, HashEx-audited contract, and capped 170B supply structure offer a scarcity play built on anti-centralization values. Early discussions suggest listing momentum could follow if current community traction continues. Traders who missed early SHIB or DOGE waves are calling MAGACOIN “the politically aligned altcoin for this cycle.” Bitcoin’s Breakout Powered by Short Squeeze and ETF Inflows The Bitcoin rally has been nothing short of historic. Between July 10–11, over $1 billion in short positions were liquidated, marking the largest forced buyback event since January. Spot ETF inflows continue to accelerate, bringing institutional demand and long-term price pressure. Bitcoin 7-Days price chart from CoinGecko Market sentiment is bullish, with open interest now clustering at the $120K and $140K strike levels. U.S. legislators are also preparing pro-crypto bills as part of an upcoming “Crypto Week,” reinforcing optimism heading into Q3. But the more telling trend? Altcoin rotations are already underway—particularly toward early narratives and low-cap bets. SUI Holds Above $3.50 as DeFi Integrations Fuel Speculation SUI is emerging as one of the most technically robust altcoins this week. After integrating tBTC—a synthetic Bitcoin asset—into its DeFi ecosystem, SUI soared above $3.50 and confirmed its inverse head-and-shoulders breakout pattern. Analysts now point to $3.89 as the next resistance target, with institutional accumulation growing and daily volume tracking higher. It’s a clear indicator that DeFi-aligned narratives are back in focus, especially those with cross-asset bridges and liquidity inflows. But SUI’s surge is also creating spillover attention for projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE—those operating in entirely different lanes but benefiting from renewed risk appetite. TON Rebounds Near $2.97 After Visa Controversy Cools Down Toncoin (TON) is stabilizing near $2.97 after weathering a wave of investor uncertainty related to its failed “golden visa” pilot in the UAE. The TON Foundation clarified its limited role in the proposal, and traders are once again watching the charts. TON’s symmetrical triangle setup signals a potential volatility breakout. Support at $2.81 has held, and sentiment is slowly improving, although technical indicators remain mixed. Analysts caution that TON needs a clean break past $3.00 to resume its previous trend. Final Thoughts Bitcoin is climbing. SUI is strengthening. TON is stabilizing. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging—fast. As traders look for early-stage opportunities beyond hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s mix of community governance, transparent supply, and political identity makes it a serious contender in the next meme altcoin breakout. For a market driven by narratives and timing, this decentralized political memecoin checks both boxes.

2025-07-23 05:25:07+00:00,New Metric Discovered to Understand Whether Cryptocurrencies Are in a Bull or Bear Market,"Cryptocurrency analyst Joao Wedson has published a comprehensive analysis of the competition between Ethereum and Tron blockchains over the USDT supply. Wedson made important inferences based on the USDT supply rate, supply gap, and the relationship between these metrics and the Bitcoin (BTC) price. USDT Supply on the Ethereum Network Increases During Bullish Periods According to Wedson''s assessment, the USDT supply ratio between Tron and Ethereum rose from 0.3 in 2019 to over 1.0 in 2022-2023, demonstrating that Tron is gaining significant momentum thanks to its low transaction fees. A particularly striking pairing was seen in 2021, when Tron''s USDT supply surpassed Ethereum''s for the first time, and BTC''s peak of $64,000. While the rate will fall again in 2024-2025, it coincided with BTC''s peaks above $100,000. According to Wedson, this suggests that in bull markets, investors tend to take advantage of the security offered by Ethereum, despite its higher transaction fees. However, recent data suggests that Tron is regaining the upper hand. Related News: Renowned Analyst Assesses Bitcoin Price for the Coming Days! How High Can It Go? What Is the State of the Fear and Greed Index? Stating that the USDT supply has increased significantly on both Tron and Ethereum since 2019, Wedson said that Ethereum was initially the leader, but Tron achieved a strong position by first exceeding $60 billion and then $80 billion by 2025. According to Wedson, supply increases on both chains generally coincide with increases in the BTC price, while Ethereum maintains its appeal to investors thanks to its DeFi infrastructure, especially during periods of market volatility. The supply gap remained negative until 2021, reflecting Ethereum''s dominance. However, in 2022-2023, this gap reached a positive level of $3-8 billion, marking Tron''s rise to the top. The gap returned to negative in 2025, with recent data showing that Tron holds approximately $3.9 billion more USDT than Ethereum.

The reason for this rip is “overwhelming demand” from exchange-traded products and corporate treasuries, said Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan on X on Wednesday. The executive compared Ethereum to Bitcoin, which, for the past 18 months, has been driven ever-upwards because ETPs and corporate treasuries “have been buying more than 100% of all the new Bitcoin being produced.” The Ethereum Demand Shock A thread on why ETH’s price is rising and why it will continue to rise in the months ahead. — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) July 22, 2025 Ethereum Supply and Demand Until recently, Ethereum had not benefited from the same trend as Ether ETFs launched in July 2024, which did not perform as well, seeing just $2.5 billion in inflows until mid-May. However, this all changed recently with spot ETH ETFs hoovering up the asset at unprecedented levels. Bitwise estimated that ETPs and corporate treasuries have combined to buy 2.83 million ETH since May 15, more than $10 billion at today’s prices, which is 32 times the net new supply over the same time period. Hougan expects this trend to continue because investors are “significantly underweight” in Ethereum compared to Bitcoin. Additionally, stablecoin regulations and a surging real-world asset tokenization market will boost Ethereum demand even further. “Meanwhile, all signs suggest the ‘ETH treasury company’ trend will accelerate,” he added. “Looking out, I can imagine ETPs and treasury companies buying $20 billion of ETH in the next year, or 5.33 million ETH at today’s prices.” He added that the network is expected to produce roughly 800,000 ETH over the same period, which equates to seven times more demand than supply. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes concurred in his latest blog post on Tuesday. “The coming Ether bull run is about to tear the market a new asshole,” he said before predicting that the asset would hit $10,000 by the end of the year. Net new ETH issuance today: ~2,468 ETH ($13 million). Net inflows into the ETH ETFs today: ~143,905 ETH ($534 million). The ETH ETFs bought 58x more ETH than was net issued by the network today.

2025-07-23 05:55:18+00:00,Unveiling the Mystery: A Colossal Bitcoin Whale Awakens After Years of Dormancy,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling the Mystery: A Colossal Bitcoin Whale Awakens After Years of Dormancy The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with a development that has sent ripples across the market: a long-dormant Bitcoin whale has sprung to life, executing a colossal transfer of funds that demands attention. Imagine a slumbering giant, holding immense wealth, suddenly stirring after years of silence. This isn’t just a fantasy; it’s the reality unfolding in the digital realm of Bitcoin. According to on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, citing data from Arkham, a staggering 10,606 BTC, valued at approximately $1.26 billion, has been moved. What makes this transfer particularly noteworthy is its origin: three distinct wallets that had remained untouched for a period ranging from three to five years. These wallets, strongly suspected to be under the control of a single, highly strategic Bitcoin whale , all received their substantial Bitcoin holdings on December 13, 2020. At that time, the price of Bitcoin was a mere $18,807, painting a vivid picture of the immense profits now realized or reallocated by this mysterious entity. What Does a Bitcoin Whale’s Awakening Signify for the Market? The sudden activity of a long-dormant Bitcoin whale often triggers a wave of speculation and analysis within the crypto community. Such large movements can be interpreted in several ways, each with distinct implications for market dynamics and investor sentiment. Profit Realization: Given the substantial increase in Bitcoin’s price since December 2020, the most straightforward interpretation is that the whale is realizing significant profits. Moving funds to an exchange could indicate an intent to sell, potentially adding selling pressure to the market. Strategic Reallocation: Alternatively, the movement might not be for selling but for reallocating assets. This could involve moving funds to a different, more secure cold storage solution, preparing for an Over-The-Counter (OTC) deal with an institutional buyer, or even preparing to participate in new decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols or staking opportunities. Market Signal: Regardless of the intent, such a large, unexpected move by a long-term holder can act as a psychological trigger. Some investors might view it as a bearish signal, fearing a dump, while others might see it as a sign of smart money positioning for future growth, especially if the funds are moving to a new, secure address rather than directly to an exchange. Consider the sheer scale: the Bitcoin acquired at $18,807 is now worth many times that amount. This means the whale has held through significant market cycles, including the 2021 bull run and the subsequent bear market. Their timing now, after years of patience, is what truly captures the market’s imagination. Tracing the Journey: How Did This Bitcoin Whale Accumulate? The journey of this particular Bitcoin whale began on December 13, 2020, a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. This period marked the early stages of what would become a historic bull run, propelling Bitcoin to new all-time highs in 2021. The decision to acquire such a large sum at that specific time highlights either incredible foresight or a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term value. The fact that the BTC was spread across three wallets, yet likely controlled by a single entity, suggests a sophisticated approach to asset management. This could be for security reasons, to diversify risk, or to prepare for different operational needs. Understanding the accumulation phase is crucial to interpreting the current move. This wasn’t a quick flip; it was a long-term holding strategy that has now culminated in a significant action. Let’s look at Bitcoin’s price journey since this whale’s initial acquisition: Date BTC Price (Approx.) Significance Dec 13, 2020 $18,807 Whale’s acquisition price April 2021 $64,000 First major ATH after acquisition Nov 2021 $69,000 All-time high (ATH) Mid-2022 $15,000 – $20,000 Bear market lows Current (Approx.) $70,000 – $73,000 Recent recovery / new ATHs This table illustrates the incredible volatility and growth the whale has weathered, underscoring the strategic nature of their recent move. Holding through a nearly 4x increase, a subsequent crash, and then another significant recovery requires immense patience and conviction. The Impact of Bitcoin Whale Movements: What Should Investors Watch For? The movements of large holders, or Bitcoin whales , are closely scrutinized by market participants because they can, at times, precede significant price shifts. While one whale’s actions don’t dictate the entire market, they can certainly influence sentiment and liquidity. Here’s what investors should consider: On-Chain Metrics: Tools from firms like Lookonchain and Arkham are invaluable. They track wallet activity, exchange inflows/outflows, and dormant supply.

Key Takeaways: 21Shares has filed for a spot ETF that would directly hold ONDO. Ondo is building out institutional-focused tokenization infrastructure. Tokenized real-world assets are on the rise, with $25B now on-chain. According to a preliminary prospectus submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, the proposed “21Shares Ondo Trust” will hold ONDO tokens directly and follow the CME CF Ondo Finance-Dollar Reference Rate. Coinbase will act as custodian of the tokens. The fund is designed to be a passive investment vehicle, with no leverage or active speculation. Shares can be created or redeemed in cash or in-kind. ONDO Powers Layer-1 Blockchain Built for Institutional Finance and RWAs ONDO is the utility token powering Ondo Chain, a layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchain purpose-built for institutional finance and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). With a current market cap of $3.5 billion and a circulating supply of 3.1 billion tokens, ONDO is priced at $1.12, down 48% from its December peak of $2.14, per CoinGecko. Among the token’s notable backers is World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated DeFi platform. The group purchased $250,000 worth of ONDO in December and currently holds 342,000 tokens, valued at around $383,000, per Nansen data. Still, ONDO accounts for just 0.2% of the platform’s $208 million portfolio, which leans heavily on stablecoins, wrapped Ether, and Bitcoin. MASSIVE ALERT: $ONDO is the next institutional darling!

Earlier in July, the protocol acquired SEC-registered broker-dealer Oasis Pro to advance its tokenized securities strategy. The move, made in collaboration with Pantera Capital, is seen as a bid to bridge traditional finance with blockchain infrastructure. Oasis Pro, which operates as an Alternative Trading System and SEC-registered transfer agent, has been a FINRA member since 2020. Ondo’s broader vision was laid out in February with the launch of Ondo Chain, its dedicated blockchain designed to cater to Wall Street firms and institutional-grade tokenization. The filing comes amid a surge in tokenized real-world asset activity. On-chain RWA value has jumped 58% this year to nearly $25 billion, according to RWA.xyz. Ethereum currently dominates the space, with 55% of RWA tokenization activity, largely in private credit and U.S. Treasurys. 95% Approval Chance for Spot Solana, XRP ETFS As reported, Bloomberg’s senior ETF analysts have assigned a 95% chance that the SEC will approve spot ETFs for Solana, XRP, and Litecoin this year, raising their previous odds from 90% amid growing optimism for institutional crypto products. They also expect a crypto index ETF tracking multiple assets could gain approval as early as this week, signaling broader access to altcoins for traditional investors. Beyond ETFs, institutional Bitcoin demand is spreading into corporate treasuries. As reported, Singapore-headquartered edtech firm Genius Group has doubled its Bitcoin holdings to 200 BTC after acquiring 20 BTC last week, part of a wider strategy to build a 10,000-BTC treasury.

2025-07-23 06:00:18+00:00,"Grayscale Eyes BONK and BNB, but MAGACOIN Is the Real Contender to Watch","Could MAGACOIN FINANCE be emerging as the political memecoin market’s next serious challenger? Daily new wallet additions for this meme-powered altcoin are quietly on the rise, outperforming many small caps on sheer user traction. Meanwhile, analyst mentions in crypto newsletters have tripled over the past month, pointing to a growing narrative: MAGACOIN isn’t just a novelty play. It offers a real alternative to BONK, underpinned by zero-tax transactions, strong ideological appeal, and expanding cross-wallet utility that’s fueling its climb. In a market chasing fresh contenders, that blend of community governance and functional growth is pushing MAGACOIN into the spotlight. MAGACOIN: Political memecoin with a purpose Unlike BONK or even BNB, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out with its explicit ideological brand as a decentralized political memecoin . Built around an anti-centralization ethos and zero-tax transactions, it taps directly into a cultural segment often overlooked by purely speculative meme tokens. Recent announcements on MAGACOIN’s new cross-wallet compatibility aim to solve fragmentation issues, letting holders move assets seamlessly across major chains. This utility-first expansion is catching attention. MAGACOIN’s community has already been lauded for driving grassroots marketing efforts that position it as more than just a meme gamble. Instead, it’s evolving into a politically charged store-of-value narrative with tangible usage, differentiating it from BONK’s primarily ecosystem-dependent growth or BNB’s traditional exchange utility. Grayscale’s strategic pivot: BONK, BNB—and wider sector hunts Grayscale’s July update has electrified crypto circles. Its expanded asset watchlist now includes BONK and BNB among 28 newly tracked tokens, alongside AI and DeFi players like Mantle and Monad. This follows hot on the heels of the SEC’s conditional approval of Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) ETF—a multi-crypto product currently delayed by procedural disputes. The asset manager’s aggressive move to diversify beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum into meme coins and ecosystem plays signals one thing: even institutions see meme-driven volatility as a strategic hedge. For BONK, this news compounds existing momentum. BONK’s daily volumes recently surged past $539 million on Bonk.fun, with token burns and buybacks pushing it toward a potential golden cross. However, skeptics note that BONK’s core dependence on Solana token launches could limit its broader cross-chain reach. Could MAGACOIN outshine BNB or BONK this quarter? As Grayscale’s institutional spotlight widens, altcoins like BONK and BNB benefit from fresh inflows and potential ETF chatter. Yet MAGACOIN’s trajectory suggests it could carve a unique lane. With XRP dealing with lingering SEC clarity despite price targets pushing toward $5, and BONK facing the ceiling of Solana-centric expansion, MAGACOIN’s broader multi-chain, ideology-driven pitch offers a rare combination of narrative and functionality. Moreover, MAGACOIN’s zero-tax model is proving attractive to traders looking to sidestep compounding transaction fees that still burden swaps in ecosystems like BNB’s. As analysts track wallet activity, the steady uptick in MAGACOIN addresses is a hard on-chain metric supporting this story. The market’s next phase: diversification with values Grayscale’s aggressive watchlist expansion underscores how 2025 isn’t just about Bitcoin or even big-layer chains anymore. Investors are exploring new frontiers: utility meme coins, politically anchored tokens, and community-owned protocols. MAGACOIN FINANCE encapsulates this trend. It’s not simply chasing speculative hype like many meme plays; its community governance and cultural identity create a narrative that institutions can’t replicate with ETFs alone. For traders and crypto observers, the big takeaway is clear: while Grayscale’s interest in BONK and BNB is headline-worthy, the real alpha may lie in decentralized political memecoins like MAGACOIN—projects that blend meme culture with genuine, ideology-fueled financial ecosystems.

Could MAGACOIN FINANCE be emerging as the political memecoin market’s next serious challenger? Daily new wallet additions for this meme-powered altcoin are quietly on the rise, outperforming many small caps on sheer user traction. Meanwhile, analyst mentions in crypto newsletters have tripled over the past month, pointing to a growing narrative: MAGACOIN isn’t just a novelty play. It offers a real alternative to BONK, underpinned by zero-tax transactions, strong ideological appeal, and expanding cross-wallet utility that’s fueling its climb.

The company acquired 79,949 ETH between July 14 and July 20 at an average price of $3,238 per token, bringing its total holdings to 360,807 ETH. The acquisition comes amid a broader trend of corporates diversifying treasury strategies by incorporating digital assets like Ethereum. Staking Activity and Market Strategy To fund the purchases, SharpLink raised $96.6 million through its at-the-market (ATM) equity program, issuing approximately 3.8 million shares. According to the company, the funds are not fully deployed, leaving room for additional ETH acquisitions in the coming weeks. This move strengthens the firm’s position as the largest corporate holder of Ethereum, positioning the token as its primary treasury reserve asset. The company’s ETH Concentration metric, which gauges crypto exposure per share, rose to 3.06, reflecting a 53% increase since mid-June. Since announcing its digital treasury strategy on June 2, SharpLink has earned 567 ETH in staking rewards, highlighting its intent to generate yield while maintaining long-term holdings . The weekly ETH purchase of nearly 80,000 tokens marked the company’s largest acquisition during any reported period, signaling continued execution of its accumulation strategy. SharpLink emphasized that its treasury model aligns with its broader business goals and shareholder value enhancement efforts. Chairman Joseph Lubin, who is also the founder of Consensys and a well-known figure in Ethereum’s development , stated that the company’s treasury strategy aims to capitalize on market conditions to build a substantial ETH reserve. Lubin noted in the company’s latest update. The continued strength of ETH and our ability to acquire significant volume at opportunistic prices support our aim to continue enhancing ETH concentration and shareholder value through disciplined execution of our treasury growth strategies. Policy Developments and Regulatory Context In addition to its ETH expansion, SharpLink also responded to regulatory developments , specifically the recent passage of the GENIUS Act by US President Donald Trump. The bipartisan legislation introduces a federal framework for stablecoins and digital asset operations, requiring full asset backing, regular audits, and clear issuer guidelines. SharpLink expressed support for the bill, citing its potential to create a more favorable climate for blockchain integration and innovation. Lubin remarked that the legislation reduces regulatory ambiguity, enabling firms like SharpLink to build more confidently in the digital asset space. Lubin said. With the GENIUS Act now law, the regulatory uncertainty that has surrounded crypto innovation is finally easing. We believe this ushers in a more supportive environment for companies like SharpLink to… harness the full potential of Ethereum — including its security, scalability and smart contract utility. With more capital still available for ETH purchases and favorable legislative conditions emerging, SharpLink’s Ethereum-based treasury strategy may continue to expand.

2025-07-23 06:11:08+00:00,Investment Bank Piper Sandler Issues Bitcoin Price Warning for the Coming Weeks,"US-based investment bank Piper Sandler warned that Bitcoin could retreat in the coming weeks due to its high correlation with stock markets, despite its strong performance in recent months. Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler, warned in an investment note published Tuesday that profits should be taken from stocks that have risen the most in the relief rally that has continued since early April. “Markets have shifted from the inflationary recession scenario they priced in on April 8th to what is now being described as a ''Goldilocks'' economic outlook, neither too hot nor too cold. The stocks most at risk during this period are high-beta, low-quality stocks that appreciate without improving their earnings outlook,” Kantrowitz said. Kantrowitz, claiming that a similar risk exists for Bitcoin, said, “Cryptocurrency is very closely directionally correlated with risk appetite in equity markets. Therefore, any sell-off in which a macroeconomic risk is priced in, Bitcoin is likely to decline in the short term.” Bitcoin, which has gained 54% since its market bottom in April, reached a new all-time high last week. This rise was driven by increased interest from institutional investors through Bitcoin ETFs and the strategy of holding BTC in corporate treasuries. The S&P 500 index returned a more modest 27% during the same period. Related News: JUST IN: Popular Cryptocurrency Platform May Launch Its Own Altcoin, Sources Say While Bitcoin has been less volatile this year, it still closely aligns with global risk appetite. For example, after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on April 3rd, Bitcoin fell 5%, while the S&P 500 fell 4%. This suggests that Bitcoin still trades in tandem with riskier assets during periods of heightened macroeconomic fears. Piper Sandler notes that the August 1st tariff deadline hasn''t been sufficiently priced into the markets. However, a potential surprise could disrupt the current “Goldilocks” environment, with a modest increase in consumer prices expected over the next three to four months. Kantrowitz noted that this scenario could complicate market expectations for a short-term interest rate cut. August is historically known as a weak month for both Bitcoin and stocks due to the decline in trading volume during the summer months. Kantrowitz emphasized that his warnings were not a general negative outlook for US stock markets, adding, “This is more of a tactical and risk-management move. While valuations are expensive, we expect earnings to continue to drive stocks higher, but with less speculative leadership.” *This is not investment advice.

Understanding market sentiment is paramount, and few metrics offer as clear a window into trader psychology as the BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios. These ratios provide a real-time pulse on whether the collective market is leaning towards bullish (long) or bearish (short) positions. For anyone navigating the volatile waters of Bitcoin derivatives, knowing these figures can be the difference between anticipating a move and being caught off guard. Understanding BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios: A Key Indicator? In the realm of cryptocurrency trading, BTC perpetual futures contracts are a cornerstone for many professional and retail traders. Unlike traditional futures, they don’t have an expiry date, allowing traders to hold positions indefinitely, provided they maintain sufficient margin. The long-short ratio, in essence, measures the proportion of open long positions versus open short positions on these contracts. A higher long percentage suggests a bullish sentiment, indicating more traders expect prices to rise, while a higher short percentage points to a bearish outlook. This ratio isn’t just a number; it’s a reflection of aggregated trader sentiment across major exchanges. It helps us gauge the prevailing mood: are traders feeling optimistic and buying, or are they pessimistic and selling short? This collective wisdom can offer valuable clues about potential price movements, especially when extreme imbalances occur. A Glimpse into the Latest BTC Perpetual Futures Sentiment: 24-Hour Overview Let’s dive into the most recent 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures across leading cryptocurrency exchanges. This snapshot offers immediate insights into how traders are positioning themselves as Bitcoin navigates its current market cycle. Total Market Sentiment (Past 24 Hours): Long: 50.33% Short: 49.67% This overall ratio suggests a remarkably balanced market sentiment, with a slight lean towards long positions. Such a near 50/50 split indicates a lack of strong consensus among traders, which can sometimes precede periods of consolidation or heightened volatility as neither bulls nor bears hold a significant upper hand. Exchange-Specific BTC Perpetual Futures Ratios: Spotting Nuances While aggregated data provides a broad overview, examining individual exchange data for BTC perpetual futures can reveal interesting nuances. Different exchanges cater to different demographics of traders, and their specific ratios can sometimes highlight unique sentiment pockets or trading strategies. Here’s a breakdown of the top three exchanges: Exchange Long (%) Short (%) Binance 51.20% 48.80% Bybit 49.30% 50.70% Gate.io 48.71% 51.29% What do these individual exchange figures tell us? Binance: With a noticeable lean towards long positions (51.20%), Binance traders appear slightly more bullish than the overall market average. This could indicate a higher retail participation base on the platform. Bybit: Bybit shows a slight tilt towards short positions (50.70%), suggesting a segment of its traders might be anticipating a minor correction or are engaging in hedging strategies. Gate.io: Similar to Bybit, Gate.io also displays a short bias (51.29%), indicating a cautious or bearish sentiment among its user base. These variations can stem from factors like user demographics, liquidity, and even funding rates specific to each platform. Understanding these nuances helps traders refine their strategies. Leveraging BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios for Your Trading Strategy How can you integrate this valuable data into your daily trading decisions for BTC perpetual futures ? Here are some actionable insights: Gauge Overall Market Sentiment: Use the aggregated ratio to understand the general mood. A very high long ratio (e.g., 60%+) might indicate over-optimism and a potential for a “long squeeze,” where prices drop sharply, forcing longs to liquidate. Conversely, an extremely high short ratio could signal a “short squeeze.” Identify Potential Reversals: When the long-short ratio reaches extreme levels, it often acts as a contrarian indicator. If almost everyone is long, there are fewer buyers left to push the price higher, making a correction more likely. Confirm Trends: A rising price accompanied by a growing long ratio can confirm a bullish trend. Similarly, a falling price with an increasing short ratio supports a bearish trend. Spot Divergences: Pay attention if the price is moving in one direction, but the long-short ratio is moving in the opposite direction. This divergence can signal a weakening trend or an impending reversal. Remember, while the long-short ratio is a powerful tool, it should always be used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis. No single indicator provides a complete picture.

2025-07-23 06:20:21+00:00,XRP/BTC Approaches Major Breakout From 8-Year Resistance,"A chart posted by investor and self-proclaimed crypto millionaire Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) has caught the attention of market watchers because it shows that XRP/BTC is once again testing a trendline that has capped the pair for nearly eight years. This resistance, drawn from a high point in 2017, has triggered lower highs since then, forming the upper boundary of a long-term descending triangle pattern .

However, XRP recently reached a new all-time high , and with its renewed strength, traders are watching to see whether this third major test results in a clean breakout. A close above 0.00003400 BTC with volume could confirm the move and shift long-term momentum in XRP’s favor.

He believes the current phase is just the beginning, and spot ETF approval could start another phase of growth for XRP, amplifying price discovery and clearing technical barriers.

A chart posted by investor and self-proclaimed crypto millionaire Gordon (@AltcoinGordon) has caught the attention of market watchers because it shows that XRP/BTC is once again testing a trendline that has capped the pair for nearly eight years. This resistance, drawn from a high point in 2017, has triggered lower highs since then, forming the upper boundary of a long-term descending triangle pattern .

2025-07-23 06:30:17+00:00,"Bitcoin is Heading to $200,000: Why MAGACOIN Has More Upside","Bitcoin just broke through a new all-time high of $118,667 on July 11, 2025 — a level that would have seemed unbelievable just a year ago. But market analysts believe the uptrend is just beginning, with Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan expecting the Bitcoin price to reach $200,000 by year’s end. So, if Bitcoin is primed for further gains, where does that leave the next wave of altcoins? For some early-stage investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer an even more interesting angle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Meme-Powered Altcoin To Watch So, what exactly is MAGACOIN FINANCE? It’s a decentralized political meme coin designed for holders who want more than just speculation. Unlike DOGE or SHIB, which lean on humor and viral memes, MAGACOIN FINANCE is built around the “Make America Great Again” theme, giving it an instantly recognizable identity. Its zero-tax model means there are no hidden fees for buying, selling, or transferring the MAGA token. That’s a major difference from typical meme coins that quietly tax holders to fund central treasuries. Here, the community owns 100% of the supply — no venture capital or dev wallets holding everyone hostage. Metric Detail Supply Fixed at 170 billion tokens Audit Fully verified by HashEx Control 100% community ownership Tax Zero-tax model Still Early Presale: Timing and Upside Could MAGACOIN FINANCE really deliver more upside than BTC? For traders hunting early-stage opportunities, the numbers show there’s still room. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s successful fundraising so far sits at just $11.2M raised, keeping it well below the big-cap meme coins. Many see this as a phase of still early presale, where holders are positioning ahead of broader listings. Unlike Bitcoin, which is already heavily institutionalized, this meme-powered altcoin gives retail buyers more control over supply shocks. As funds rotate from major layer-ones, alt-chain capital rotation favors the MAGACOIN narrative. The project’s unique political edge sets it apart from coins like XRP, ADA, or ETH, which rely on enterprise use cases rather than grassroots identity. Bitcoin’s Supply Squeeze Fuels Broader Crypto Moves As Matt Hougan explained in a recent interview, Bitcoin’s “massive, unrelenting demand is meeting limited supply,” with ETFs alone adding $5.2 billion in BTC over just 30 days. These flows keep pushing price ceilings higher, and that enthusiasm often spills over into the altcoin market. BTC 7D price chart from CoinGecko When Bitcoin rallies, retail investors typically look for high-upside plays that match the market’s energy but with lower barriers to entry. That’s where narrative-driven coins like MAGACOIN FINANCE come in. While BTC may be about institutional hedging, MAGACOIN is about community power and ideology. MAGACOIN’s Branding vs XRP, ADA, and DOGE Unlike XRP, which battles regulatory headlines, or ADA and ETH, which pitch smart contract scaling, MAGACOIN FINANCE is all about the grassroots holder. It fuses ideological branding with real tokenomics — no big treasury, no constant dilution. This anti-centralization theme is resonating. Holders see it as a decentralized political memecoin that can’t be easily captured by whales. Its tight supply model mirrors Bitcoin’s own scarcity narrative, which is what many believe will push BTC toward $200,000 by year-end. Could MAGACOIN FINANCE see a similar narrative lift on a smaller scale? That’s the trend many are betting on as the meme coin market pivots from jokes to identity-driven community projects. Final Takeaway: More Than a Meme Bitcoin’s path toward $200,000 reminds everyone how powerful a fixed supply and strong narrative can be. MAGACOIN FINANCE takes that same scarcity-driven model and layers on an ideological message that resonates deeply with its target community. For holders seeking early-stage exposure to a meme-powered altcoin that combines decentralization, zero tax, and American political branding, MAGACOIN FINANCE may stand out as one of the few genuinely narrative-driven tokens ready to catch the next wave.

2025-07-23 07:00:37+00:00,"Illegal Crypto Network Uncovered In UK: ATMs Seized, Arrests Made","A pair of arrests and the seizure of seven crypto ATMs in southwest London marked the latest move by UK regulators against unlicensed digital‑currency services. According to a press statemen t issued by the Financial Conduct Authority, two people were interviewed under caution after officers from the FCA and the Metropolitan Police searched four sites this week. Investigators say the machines were part of an unregistered exchange network that skirted anti‑money laundering rules. Strict Crackdown In London Based on reports from the FCA, operating a crypto ATM without registration has carried real consequences for some. Since January 2021, any firm offering cryptoasset exchanges or kiosks must sign up with the agency and carry out customer due diligence. Those checks include verifying where funds come from and making sure machines can’t be used to hide illicit money. Now, with seven ATMs taken offline and two suspects released pending further inquiries, the message is clear: regulators aren’t messing around. Warning On Unregistered Machines The FCA’s executive director of enforcement and market oversight, Therese Chambers, warned operators that unregistered machines “only support crime.” She pointed out that there are currently zero legal crypto ATMs in the UK, and anyone caught running one faces not just fines but possible jail time. No formal charges have been filed yet in this latest sweep, but the probe is ongoing. Several weeks ago, the first criminal sentencing for an unregistered crypto ATM network made headlines. A certain Olumide Osunkoya was handed a four‑year prison term after running a £2.5 million operation through his company, GidiPlus. Court documents showed his ATMs bypassed basic safeguards and charged markups of up to 60%. He continued despite being denied FCA registration and was convicted of using false identity documents, forgery and possession of criminal property. Comparison With Other Countries While the UK maintains a total ban, other nations are taking varied paths. In the US, more than 29,000 crypto ATMs are up and running, though state regulators are stepping in. Nebraska imposed licensing rules, transaction caps and scam refund requirements. In Spokane, Washington, city officials moved to ban machines outright. New Zealand went further with a full national ban, and in Australia new controls now limit how much cash customers can swap per transaction and force kiosks to display scam warnings. This patchwork of approaches shows there’s no single answer. Some argue that a strict ban stops criminals. Others say regulated machines can help everyday people buy crypto safely—if those machines follow the rules.

2025-07-23 07:04:32+00:00,"Rich Dad Poor Dad Author Says Biggest Crash in History Coming Soon, Predicts New Round of US Dollar Printing","The best-selling personal finance author Robert Kiyosaki is warning of a massive market crash on the horizon. Kiyosaki tells his 2.8 million followers on the social media platform X that the “biggest crash in history” is coming soon. The author of the personal finance bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad says the cause of the market crash is likely to be the high levels of debt the US has incurred so far. According to Kiyosaki, the US is the “biggest debtor nation in history” due to the fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve. “Q: What does the Fed do when they f**k up? A: 1987 Market Crash? PRINT fake dollars 1998 [Long-Term Capital Management] LTCM collapse? PRINT fake dollars 2019 Repo Market seizure? PRINT dollars COVID-19 Pandemic? PRINT fake dollars SILICON VALLEY BANK crash PRINT dollars It’s not a new crisis… it’s the same crisis getting bigger.” The Rich Dad Poor Dad author says the solution to the approaching crisis is for people to “stop saving fake” US dollars and put their money in hard assets. “Start saving real gold, silver, Bitcoin. Protect your wealth.” Earlier this week, the best-selling author said an asset bubble was on the cusp of bursting. According to Kiyosaki, the bursting of such a bubble would present him with an attractive entry opportunity for hard assets. “When bubbles burst, odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will burst too. Good news. If prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin crash…. I will be buying.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The author of the personal finance bestseller Rich Dad Poor Dad says the cause of the market crash is likely to be the high levels of debt the US has incurred so far. According to Kiyosaki, the US is the “biggest debtor nation in history” due to the fiscal policies of the Federal Reserve. “Q: What does the Fed do when they f**k up? A: 1987 Market Crash? PRINT fake dollars 1998 [Long-Term Capital Management] LTCM collapse? PRINT fake dollars 2019 Repo Market seizure? PRINT dollars COVID-19 Pandemic? PRINT fake dollars SILICON VALLEY BANK crash PRINT dollars It’s not a new crisis… it’s the same crisis getting bigger.” The Rich Dad Poor Dad author says the solution to the approaching crisis is for people to “stop saving fake” US dollars and put their money in hard assets. “Start saving real gold, silver, Bitcoin. Protect your wealth.” Earlier this week, the best-selling author said an asset bubble was on the cusp of bursting. According to Kiyosaki, the bursting of such a bubble would present him with an attractive entry opportunity for hard assets. “When bubbles burst, odds are gold, silver, and Bitcoin will burst too. Good news. If prices of gold, silver, and Bitcoin crash…. I will be buying.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The ETH/BTC ratio, a key chart that measures Ethereum’s strength against Bitcoin, recently flipped its 50-week moving average for the first time since 2023. This kind of move often means a trend reversal. Experts have said that this could mean the start of a mini altcoin cycle, with Ethereum leading the way.

2025-07-23 07:21:24+00:00,Altseason Hype Heats Up: Santiment Warns of Volatility Ahead as ETH Nears $4K,"Ethereum’s current rally has reignited talk of an incoming altseason, but not everyone is convinced the party will last. Market intelligence platform Santiment has warned that growing chatter about an altseason could signal an impending spike in volatility, citing historical patterns of market reversals following crowd euphoria. Signs of Altseason Emerge Over the past three months, ETH has staged a remarkable comeback, climbing more than 110% per data from CoinGecko, to reach $3,732. The asset is also up nearly 20% in the last seven days, vastly outpacing the broader crypto market’s 3.8% gain in the same period. Whale activity has followed suit, with more than 500,000 ETH accumulated by large holders in the past two weeks, according to on-chain analyst Ali Martinez. Fellow market watcher Chyan noted on July 23 that ETH’s run has pushed social volume and dominance toward year-to-date highs as the asset creeps toward $4,000. “CT’s heating up. Charts stirring. Just one spark away,” posted Chyan. Their observations align with a recent CryptoQuant analysis showing altcoin volume on Binance Futures hit $100.7 billion, the highest since February. With ETH leading large caps like Solana and XRP, experts see a clear sign that capital is rotating away from Bitcoin. Meanwhile, BTC’s dominance has dropped below 59%, down 8.5% in recent weeks, while ETH’s has climbed to 11.2%. Yesterday, Swissblock analysts said in a report that altseasons typically begin when the flagship cryptocurrency loses strength and altcoins break out broadly, a scenario that is currently unfolding. Volatility Looms as Bulls Test Resistance Despite the optimism, not all signals point to a smooth ride ahead. According to Santiment, crowd belief in an altseason often precedes short-term shakeouts. “When the crowd begins to perpetuate that we are in ‘altseason,’ beware of some upcoming volatility,” the analytics firm cautioned. “Crypto prices historically move up most prominently during periods of crowd disbelief.” Market strategist Alex Kuptsikevich also noted that investors are starting to scale back BTC exposure in favor of altcoins, increasing the risk of abrupt corrections. Technically, Ethereum is nearing major resistance near the $3,800 level, where it has twice failed to break higher in the last seven days. The asset remains 23.4% below its all-time high of $4,878 set in November 2021, but momentum is building. Over the past 30 days, ETH is up 67%, and more than 43% in the last two weeks, indicating sizable capital inflows. Yet with about $45 billion in daily trading volume and rising retail interest, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency could be heading for a cooling-off phase if traders begin to take profits or if BTC experiences further pullback. CoinGlass data, however, suggests that the market remains far from its bull market peak, a potential signal that the broader rally may still have legs.

2025-07-23 07:25:22+00:00,South Korea’s Landmark Move: Unveiling Robust Stablecoin Licensing for Won-Backed Digital Assets,"BitcoinWorld South Korea’s Landmark Move: Unveiling Robust Stablecoin Licensing for Won-Backed Digital Assets The cryptocurrency world is constantly evolving, and regulatory landscapes are shifting just as rapidly. One of the most significant developments on the horizon involves South Korea stablecoin regulation , particularly its approach to won-backed digital assets. Imagine a future where the stability of traditional currency meets the innovation of blockchain, but with a robust safety net woven by meticulous oversight. That’s precisely the direction South Korea appears to be heading, signaling a pivotal shift that could redefine how stablecoins operate within its financial ecosystem. Recent reports from Financial News indicate a strong lean towards a licensing-based model for issuers of Korean won-based stablecoins, moving away from a simpler registration approach. This isn’t just a minor administrative tweak; it’s a profound statement about the nation’s commitment to financial stability and consumer protection in the burgeoning digital asset space. This proposal emerged during a crucial policy forum on July 23, where experts gathered to discuss the intricate process of integrating stablecoins into the country’s formal financial system. Why a Licensing Model for South Korea Stablecoin Regulation? The debate between a registration and a licensing model boils down to control, accountability, and the inherent risks associated with financial instruments that aim to mirror sovereign currencies. Hwang Sei-woon, a respected researcher at the Korea Capital Market Institute and a key member of the stablecoin task force (led by Democratic Party lawmaker Ahn Do-geol), passionately advocated for the licensing approach. His core argument is straightforward yet powerful: only entities possessing specific, stringent qualifications should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing stablecoins. And for that trust to be earned, a formal, rigorous licensing process is essential. Hwang’s perspective is rooted in the understanding that stablecoins, particularly those pegged to a national currency like the Korean Won, carry significant implications for monetary policy, financial stability, and consumer confidence. A simple registration, which often involves merely listing an entity, provides far less regulatory oversight and consumer protection compared to a comprehensive licensing framework that scrutinizes an issuer’s financial health, operational capabilities, and compliance measures. Enhanced Consumer Protection: Licensing ensures that issuers meet strict financial and operational standards, safeguarding users’ funds. Financial Stability: By controlling who can issue stablecoins, regulators can mitigate systemic risks to the broader financial system. Market Integrity: A robust licensing regime fosters trust and legitimacy, encouraging broader adoption while weeding out speculative or poorly managed ventures. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF): Licensing allows for more thorough due diligence on issuers, strengthening efforts against illicit financial activities. Setting the Bar: Capital Requirements for Won-Backed Stablecoins One of the most critical aspects highlighted by Hwang Sei-woon is the necessity for uniform capital requirements for stablecoin issuers. This isn’t just about having money in the bank; it’s about ensuring that issuers have sufficient reserves and financial resilience to withstand market volatility, operational failures, or unexpected redemption demands. The proposed thresholds are particularly insightful when viewed against existing regulations for traditional financial service providers. Under current Korean law, prepaid payment instrument (PPI) providers are mandated to hold at least 2 billion won (approximately $1.4 million), while electronic money businesses (EMBs) must maintain a minimum of 5 billion won (approximately $3.6 million) in capital. Hwang suggests that given the “broader utility” and potential systemic impact of stablecoins, even higher thresholds might be necessary. This comparison underscores the gravity with which Korean regulators are approaching stablecoins – viewing them not just as niche crypto assets, but as instruments with the potential to significantly impact the mainstream financial system. Let’s consider why higher capital requirements for won-backed stablecoins are a prudent step: Financial Instrument Type Minimum Capital Requirement (KRW) Minimum Capital Requirement (USD Approx.)

Key Takeaways: DigitalX has boosted its Bitcoin holdings to nearly 500 BTC, now valued at over $100 million. The firm allocated $12.8 million from a recent capital raise toward Bitcoin accumulation. DigitalX joins a growing list of public companies embracing Bitcoin as a long-term treasury asset. The move brings its total holdings to 499.8 BTC, valued at around $91.3 million, the firm announced Tuesday . The latest purchase was executed at an average price of $117,293 per coin. DigitalX’s Bitcoin Treasury Tops $100M with Combined Holdings Of the nearly 500 BTC, 306.8 are held directly on the company’s balance sheet, while 193 BTC are managed through its stake in the DigitalX Bitcoin ETF. Combined, the company’s digital asset treasury now exceeds $100 million. This marks DigitalX’s second major Bitcoin acquisition in July, following a 57.5 BTC purchase earlier in the month. The company raised $13.5 million earlier this month to fund further Bitcoin buys and expand its strategic advisory board, which now includes Animoca Brands’ Yat Siu and Web3 veteran Hervé Larren. DigitalX Adds 74.7 Bitcoin. DigitalX Limited (ASX: DCC) has acquired an additional 74.7 BTC at an average price of USD $117,293, bringing total Bitcoin holdings to 499.8 BTC valued at $91.3 million. Read the full ASX announcement here: https://t.co/S7egCfZ15P pic.twitter.com/5CvAjYGkX9 — DigitalX Ltd (@DigitalXLtd) July 23, 2025 Of the capital raised, $12.8 million has already been allocated to Bitcoin accumulation. The remaining funds are intended for general operations and working capital. “This milestone reinforces our Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-focused strategy,” said Leigh Travers, DigitalX’s non-executive chairman and director of capital markets at Animoca Brands. “As one of the world’s first listed Bitcoin miners in 2014, DigitalX has been at the forefront of crypto innovation. Today, we’re leveraging that early leadership to set the institutional standard for Bitcoin exposure in Australia.” The strategy aligns DigitalX with a broader corporate trend that began with MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership , the U.S.-based business intelligence firm holds over 597,000 BTC, establishing it as the largest institutional holder. The trend is spreading across Asia as well, with Metaplanet — dubbed “Asia’s MicroStrategy” — steadily building its own Bitcoin treasury through equity and debt fundraising. Other publicly traded firms from outside the crypto sector are also following suit. Hong Kong’s DDC Enterprise, known for its food brands, recently raised $528 million to build a Bitcoin treasury . Canada’s Solar Bank, a renewable energy company, has also declared plans to acquire BTC, despite environmental criticisms. Advocates argue that a growing share of Bitcoin mining is powered by clean energy. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

DigitalX Adds 74.7 Bitcoin. DigitalX Limited (ASX: DCC) has acquired an additional 74.7 BTC at an average price of USD $117,293, bringing total Bitcoin holdings to 499.8 BTC valued at $91.3 million. Read the full ASX announcement here: https://t.co/S7egCfZ15P pic.twitter.com/5CvAjYGkX9 — DigitalX Ltd (@DigitalXLtd) July 23, 2025 Of the capital raised, $12.8 million has already been allocated to Bitcoin accumulation. The remaining funds are intended for general operations and working capital. “This milestone reinforces our Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-focused strategy,” said Leigh Travers, DigitalX’s non-executive chairman and director of capital markets at Animoca Brands. “As one of the world’s first listed Bitcoin miners in 2014, DigitalX has been at the forefront of crypto innovation. Today, we’re leveraging that early leadership to set the institutional standard for Bitcoin exposure in Australia.” The strategy aligns DigitalX with a broader corporate trend that began with MicroStrategy, now known as Strategy. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership , the U.S.-based business intelligence firm holds over 597,000 BTC, establishing it as the largest institutional holder. The trend is spreading across Asia as well, with Metaplanet — dubbed “Asia’s MicroStrategy” — steadily building its own Bitcoin treasury through equity and debt fundraising. Other publicly traded firms from outside the crypto sector are also following suit. Hong Kong’s DDC Enterprise, known for its food brands, recently raised $528 million to build a Bitcoin treasury . Canada’s Solar Bank, a renewable energy company, has also declared plans to acquire BTC, despite environmental criticisms. Advocates argue that a growing share of Bitcoin mining is powered by clean energy. Doubts Grow Over Long-Term Viability of Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Skepticism around the sustainability of the Bitcoin treasury trend is growing. Last month, Glassnode lead analyst James Check raised concerns over the longevity of the corporate Bitcoin treasury strategy, arguing the easy gains might already be gone for new entrants as the market matures. The warning echoes recent comments from Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, who has voiced concerns over the Bitcoin treasury strategies adopted by some publicly traded firms. Sigel singled out the use of at-the-market (ATM) share issuance programs, arguing that these can become dilutive if a company’s stock price nears its Bitcoin net asset value (NAV). Meanwhile, New York law firm Pomerantz LLP has filed a class action lawsuit against Michael Saylor’s Strategy, accusing the Bitcoin-focused firm of misleading investors about the profitability and risks of its crypto investment strategy.

2025-07-23 07:34:20+00:00,"XRP Whale Transfers Exceed $1B, Fueling Hopes for a New Upswing","Whales Re-entering the Market The XRP network has witnessed a massive surge in whale transfers, with daily on‑chain movements exceeding the $1 billion mark for the first time in over a month. Data from XRPScan and TradingView show that the XRP Ledger recorded $1.07 billion in transfer volume, peaking at 1.72 billion XRP exchanged in 2.08 million transactions, as nearly 10,279 addresses interacted in a single day. Notably whale transfers of more than $1 billion are not only about liquidity redistribution but also coordinated accumulation, shifting network dynamics, and mounting confidence in XRP’s ascent. Technical & Institutional Tailwinds XRP’s rebound has been underpinned by strong technical setups, such as double‑bottom breakouts, a bullish MACD crossover, and an emerging Gold Cross all fuelling trader optimism. Market analyst Tom Tucker recently noted that XRP had completed a bullish cup-and-handle breakout above $3.40, setting the stage for a potential rally toward $5.27. On the institutional front, futures open interest surged to a record $11 billion, signaling growing confidence from large-scale investors. Controlled Supply from Ripple This explosive whale on‑chain activity follows Ripple’s strategic asset releases. Ripple recently unlocked 1 billion XRP, re‑locking 700 million and allocating 300 million for partnerships and liquidity initiatives.This carefully phased unlocking balances supply pressures while supporting ecosystem growth. Therefore, the convergence of colossal whale transfers, rising on‑chain activity, robust technical markers, institutional involvement, and controlled supply paints a bullish picture for XRP. Surpassing $1 billion in daily transfers highlights heightened utility, as well as intensified speculative and strategic accumulation by large investors. Japan’s “Earn XRP” Takes Effect Aplus, the credit card arm of Japan’s Shinsei Bank Group, recently partnered with SBI VC Trade to launch a groundbreaking crypto-based rewards program. For the first time, Aplus credit cardholders will have the opportunity to convert their reward points directly into cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, Bitcoin, and Ether, making Aplus Japan’s first major loyalty program to offer crypto redemption. Calling out this development, digital strategist John Squire pointed out , “You can now earn XRP with your credit card in Japan. Thanks to a new partnership with SBI, Aplus cardholders can convert reward points into XRP, BTC, or ETH. This is real-world adoption, not speculation.” This strategic move accelerates the mainstream adoption of XRP, Bitcoin, and Ethereum, driving broader crypto integration into everyday finance. Conclusion The XRP transfers of more than $1.07 billion can be seen as a coordinated whale response to price triggers, institutional momentum, and regulatory developments. With whales reducing on-chain selling, accumulating more through private transfers, and factoring in bullish technicals, XRP seems set for another leg higher above its present all-time high of $3.65.

2025-07-23 07:39:03+00:00,Ethereum Price Outpaces Bitcoin and XRP Amid Bullish Momentum,"The post Ethereum Price Outpaces Bitcoin and XRP Amid Bullish Momentum appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The Ethereum price has risen 19% in the last 7 days and an impressive 64% over the past 30 days, significantly outperforming Bitcoin’s 1.7% and XRP’s 21.1% in the same period. From its April 2025 low, ETH has now surged by more than 150%, marking a dramatic reversal from its earlier bearish phase. Until April, ETH hadn’t posted a single positive monthly return. May broke the downtrend with a 41.1% gain, while July has now become the strongest month yet. Why Ethereum Price is Surging? Ethereum’s recent performance stands out against the broader market. Over the past week, ETH outperformed both Bitcoin (1.7%) and XRP (21.1%). Over 30 days, Ethereum is up 64%, solidifying its position as the top-performing major crypto asset. From its April low, ETH has gained over 150%, supported by consistent green daily closes, especially between July 8 and 21 when the price jumped 47.86%. Hougan attributes much of the current rally to a surge in institutional interest. Since the approval of spot Ethereum ETFs in July 2024, interest had remained modest until recently. Between July 2024 and mid-May 2025, ETFs and corporate buyers accumulated just 660,000 ETH. The Ethereum Demand Shock A thread on why ETH''s price is rising and why it will continue to rise in the months ahead. — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) July 22, 2025 But since May 15, that number has exploded. More than 2.83 million ETH has been acquired by ETPs and corporations, equivalent to around $5 billion in inflows. Companies like Bitmine and SharpLink have been publicly increasing their ETH holdings and even staking them to generate yield. Ethereum Supply-Demand Gap: Is ETH Becoming Deflationary? While demand has soared, Ethereum’s supply growth has remained extremely limited. In the same period when 2.83 million ETH was bought, only 88,000 new ETH were created by the network. That’s a supply-demand gap of more than 32x. Hougan notes that this mismatch is a key reason why ETH’s price has been climbing so sharply. The dynamic reflects a growing institutional appetite for Ethereum, both as an investment and a productive asset. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : After BNB will this Altcoin Hit a New ATH Next? , Ethereum Price Forecast 2025: Can ETH Hit $10,000?

Hougan estimates that another $20 billion could flow into Ethereum via ETFs and corporate treasuries over the next 12 months, translating to about 5.33 million ETH. In contrast, the network is projected to issue just 800,000 ETH during that period. If this buying continues, ETH’s supply will remain tight, potentially driving further price gains. Whether this results in new all-time highs remains to be seen, but the fundamentals are pointing toward sustained bullish momentum. Ethereum’s current rally is more than just a market bounce; it’s being driven by strong fundamentals. As institutional demand grows and supply remains constrained, ETH may continue to outperform.

2025-07-23 07:45:18+00:00,Explosive South Korea Crypto Volume: Retail Investors Fuel Astonishing Surge,"BitcoinWorld Explosive South Korea Crypto Volume: Retail Investors Fuel Astonishing Surge The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, constantly shaped by various forces. Recently, a significant shift has been observed in the Asian market, particularly concerning the South Korea crypto volume . This dramatic increase has caught the attention of market analysts and investors worldwide, signaling potential trends and opportunities. Unpacking the Astonishing Surge in South Korea Crypto Volume In a recent revelation shared on X, the prominent crypto services provider Matrixport shed light on a remarkable development in the South Korean crypto landscape. Over the past two weeks, the total crypto trading volume in the nation experienced an astonishing leap, surging from a mere $1 billion to an impressive $6 billion. This six-fold increase underscores a robust resurgence of interest and activity within the market. What makes this surge even more compelling is the primary driving force behind it: the strong engagement of retail investors. Unlike institutional players, retail investors often react swiftly to market sentiment and news, injecting a unique dynamism into trading volumes. Matrixport’s report highlights that this retail-led momentum is a key characteristic of the current market upswing in Korea. Simultaneously with the escalating South Korea crypto volume , Bitcoin’s open interest has also soared by approximately $6 billion. Open interest, in simple terms, represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A significant increase in open interest, especially when coupled with rising prices, often indicates new money flowing into the market and a strong conviction among traders. Adding another layer to this bullish narrative is the rise in the annualized funding rate. The funding rate is a periodic payment made to long or short traders based on the difference between perpetual contract prices and spot prices. A positive and increasing funding rate suggests that long positions are dominant and willing to pay short positions to keep their trades open, hinting at the growth of aggressive leveraged long positions in the market. Matrixport specifically highlighted this, indicating a speculative fervor among traders betting on continued price appreciation. Why Are Retail Investors Driving This Korean Crypto Boom? South Korea has long been recognized as a hotbed for cryptocurrency adoption, with a tech-savvy population and a high degree of financial literacy. Several factors contribute to why retail investors are particularly dominant in driving the current South Korea crypto volume boom: High Digital Adoption: South Korea boasts one of the highest internet and smartphone penetration rates globally, making digital asset trading highly accessible to the general public. Cultural Propensity for Investment: Historically, South Koreans have shown a strong inclination towards speculative investments, from traditional stocks to real estate. Cryptocurrencies fit well into this cultural appetite for high-growth assets. Accessible Trading Platforms: Local exchanges like Upbit and Bithumb offer user-friendly interfaces and robust infrastructure, catering effectively to retail traders. Past Market Experiences: Many Korean retail investors have experienced significant gains (and losses) in previous crypto bull runs, fostering a resilient and often aggressive trading mentality. The ‘Kimchi Premium’ phenomenon, where Bitcoin trades at a higher price on Korean exchanges compared to global averages, further illustrates the unique local demand. Social Media Influence: Crypto communities and influencers on platforms like KakaoTalk and Telegram play a significant role in disseminating information and shaping retail sentiment. This confluence of factors creates a fertile ground for retail-led surges, making the South Korea crypto volume a crucial metric to watch for global market participants. Understanding Leveraged Longs: Risks and Rewards in South Korea’s Market The mention of ‘aggressive leveraged long positions’ by Matrixport is a critical detail. Leverage allows traders to open positions larger than their initial capital by borrowing funds. While this can amplify profits during an uptrend, it also significantly magnifies potential losses. Here’s a closer look at what this implies for the South Korea crypto volume : Amplified Market Movements: A high concentration of leveraged long positions can lead to exaggerated price movements. If prices move favorably, profits are compounded; however, a sudden downturn can trigger widespread liquidations. Increased Volatility: The presence of significant leverage inherently increases market volatility. Large liquidation events, often referred to as ‘long squeezes,’ can cause rapid price drops as automated systems close out positions to prevent further losses.

BitcoinWorld Explosive South Korea Crypto Volume: Retail Investors Fuel Astonishing Surge The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic arena, constantly shaped by various forces. Recently, a significant shift has been observed in the Asian market, particularly concerning the South Korea crypto volume . This dramatic increase has caught the attention of market analysts and investors worldwide, signaling potential trends and opportunities. Unpacking the Astonishing Surge in South Korea Crypto Volume In a recent revelation shared on X, the prominent crypto services provider Matrixport shed light on a remarkable development in the South Korean crypto landscape. Over the past two weeks, the total crypto trading volume in the nation experienced an astonishing leap, surging from a mere $1 billion to an impressive $6 billion. This six-fold increase underscores a robust resurgence of interest and activity within the market. What makes this surge even more compelling is the primary driving force behind it: the strong engagement of retail investors. Unlike institutional players, retail investors often react swiftly to market sentiment and news, injecting a unique dynamism into trading volumes. Matrixport’s report highlights that this retail-led momentum is a key characteristic of the current market upswing in Korea. Simultaneously with the escalating South Korea crypto volume , Bitcoin’s open interest has also soared by approximately $6 billion. Open interest, in simple terms, represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, such as futures or options, that have not yet been settled. A significant increase in open interest, especially when coupled with rising prices, often indicates new money flowing into the market and a strong conviction among traders. Adding another layer to this bullish narrative is the rise in the annualized funding rate. The funding rate is a periodic payment made to long or short traders based on the difference between perpetual contract prices and spot prices. A positive and increasing funding rate suggests that long positions are dominant and willing to pay short positions to keep their trades open, hinting at the growth of aggressive leveraged long positions in the market. Matrixport specifically highlighted this, indicating a speculative fervor among traders betting on continued price appreciation. Why Are Retail Investors Driving This Korean Crypto Boom?

2025-07-23 08:29:24+00:00,Chart Decoder Series: VWAP – The Market’s Truth Detector,"Welcome back to the Chart Decoder Series, where we break down the tools that separate casual traders from the pros. You’ve already mastered trend identification (SMA/EMA) , momentum shifts (MACD) , overbought/oversold zones (RSI) , volatility extremes (Bollinger Bands) , and r eversal timing (Stochastic) . Now it’s time for VWAP, the indicator that cuts through the noise and tells you one simple thing: Are you overpaying? What is VWAP? VWAP stands for Volume Weighted Average Price. It shows you the average price that everyone paid today, but gives more weight to prices where lots of trading happened. If Bitcoin had a quick spike to $110,000 but only a few people bought there, while most of the day it traded around $105,000 with significant buying and selling, VWAP will be much closer to $105,000. The calculation is simple in concept: Take every trade throughout the day Multiply price × volume for each trade Add them all up and divide by total volume What you get is the “true” average price that reflects where most of the money actually changed hands. How to Read VWAP: Above VWAP = Paying More Than Most. When the price is above VWAP, you’re paying more than what most people paid today (weighted by how much they bought). This could mean: Lots of people are buying right now, driving the price up You might be buying when the price is temporarily high The price might come back down to where most people bought Below VWAP = Getting a Better Deal. When the price is below VWAP, you’re getting a better price than what most people paid today. This often means: More people are selling than buying, pushing the price down You might be getting a good deal compared to earlier buyers The price might bounce back up to where most people bought At VWAP = Paying the Average. When price trades right at VWAP, you’re paying exactly what the average person paid today, based on all the buying and selling that happened. Big traders use VWAP to benchmark their trades. This is why VWAP often acts as support or resistance – institutional algorithms are programmed to defend these levels. Real Example: BTC/USD on Bitfinex Price: $118,940 VWAP: $118,502 Bitcoin is trading above VWAP by about $438, which puts us in mild premium territory. Trading above VWAP typically signals bullish momentum. It means that the average buyer in this session is in profit, a strong indicator that demand is currently outweighing supply. However, the premium isn’t excessive, suggesting the move is still measured rather than euphoric. A few dynamics might be at play: Buyers are in control , but not aggressively so. It’s a sign of healthy, steady accumulation. VWAP may act as dynamic support . Should the price retrace, the VWAP line around $118,502 could be a level where buyers step back in. No clear discount is present at the moment. Traders looking for bargain entries may want to wait for a potential retest of VWAP. In short, Bitcoin is currently in a balanced but bullish posture , and traders may want to watch how price behaves around VWAP to gauge whether this move has more legs — or if it’s time for a breather. VWAP + Other Indicators: The Power Combo VWAP works even better when combined with other tools: VWAP + RSI : If price is above VWAP and RSI is showing overbought, that’s a strong signal you might be buying at a temporary peak. VWAP + Volume: When price approaches VWAP with increasing volume, it often signals a significant level. Big players might be defending or testing this “fair value” line. VWAP + Support/Resistance: VWAP often acts as dynamic support in uptrends and resistance in downtrends. It’s like a moving floor or ceiling based on where the real trading happened. Looking at our BTC example: With price below VWAP at $111,080 vs $111,321, if we see strong buying volume as BTC approaches VWAP from below, that could signal institutional interest in defending the “fair value” line. Bonus Read: VWAP + RSI Power Combo Price: $118,940 VWAP: $118,502 RSI: 66.11 This indicates Bitcoin is in bullish momentum but approaching overbought territory (RSI above 70 is typically considered overbought) This setup is particularly interesting: While the technical indicators are clearly bullish, the RSI’s proximity to overbought territory suggests that traders should remain alert for potential pullbacks or consolidation periods. The VWAP level at $118,502 could serve as an important support zone if the price does decide to retrace from current levels. Overall, this combination of price action above VWAP paired with healthy RSI momentum creates a bullish environment for Bitcoin, though the approaching overbought conditions suggest that any upside moves should be monitored carefully for signs of momentum exhaustion. Pro Tips for Using VWAP: 1. VWAP Resets Daily Unlike moving averages that look back a set number of periods, VWAP resets at the start of each trading day. This makes it perfect for day trading and short-term decisions. 2.

According to the Seattle US Attorney’s Office, the money was seized by Homeland Security in December 2024, and is part of a much larger fraud that allegedly collected $97 million from investors between June 2022 and July 2024. Victims were told their money would go into oil tank storage facilities – an investment that promised big returns. But once they sent funds, the people behind the scheme simply stopped responding. “The co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,” said Acting US Attorney Teal Luthy Miller. Funds Moved Through Russia, Nigeria, and Binance The fraud quickly turned into a global money-laundering operation . Prosecutors say victims’ money was used to buy Bitcoin (BTC) , Tether (USDT) , USDC, and Ether (ETH) , and then moved through accounts connected to people in Russia and Nigeria. A large part of the stolen crypto was reportedly sent to Binance , the world’s biggest crypto exchange. One person, Geoffrey Auyeung, has already been indicted. He was charged in August 2024 for receiving most of the stolen funds and converting them into crypto. At the time of his arrest, US officials also seized $2.3 million from his bank accounts. The U.S. government is setting its sights on $7.1M in crypto, clawed back from an oil and gas investment scam. Even in the digital age, old-school scams find their new playgrounds. Always vet before you bet! #CryptoCrackdown #InvestmentScam — Shaco AI (@Shaco_Ai) July 23, 2025 $17.9 Million Already Tracked, More Expected So far, prosecutors have identified $17.9 million in losses, but expect more victims to come forward. If the court approves the $7.1 million seizure, the total amount recovered would rise to $9.4 million, which will go toward reimbursing verified victims. Part of a Larger Crackdown Not an isolated case, actually. In recent weeks, US and international authorities have stepped up action against crypto-related fraud: OmegaPro promoters were charged in a $650 million scam. Ex-rugby player Shane Donovan Moore was sentenced for a $900,000 Ponzi scheme. In Hong Kong , police arrested four people linked to a $382,000 investor fraud. The suspected ringleader fled overseas.

But once they sent funds, the people behind the scheme simply stopped responding. “The co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims,” said Acting US Attorney Teal Luthy Miller. Funds Moved Through Russia, Nigeria, and Binance The fraud quickly turned into a global money-laundering operation . Prosecutors say victims’ money was used to buy Bitcoin (BTC) , Tether (USDT) , USDC, and Ether (ETH) , and then moved through accounts connected to people in Russia and Nigeria. A large part of the stolen crypto was reportedly sent to Binance , the world’s biggest crypto exchange. One person, Geoffrey Auyeung, has already been indicted. He was charged in August 2024 for receiving most of the stolen funds and converting them into crypto. At the time of his arrest, US officials also seized $2.3 million from his bank accounts. The U.S. government is setting its sights on $7.1M in crypto, clawed back from an oil and gas investment scam. Even in the digital age, old-school scams find their new playgrounds. Always vet before you bet! #CryptoCrackdown #InvestmentScam — Shaco AI (@Shaco_Ai) July 23, 2025 $17.9 Million Already Tracked, More Expected So far, prosecutors have identified $17.9 million in losses, but expect more victims to come forward. If the court approves the $7.1 million seizure, the total amount recovered would rise to $9.4 million, which will go toward reimbursing verified victims. Part of a Larger Crackdown Not an isolated case, actually. In recent weeks, US and international authorities have stepped up action against crypto-related fraud: OmegaPro promoters were charged in a $650 million scam. Ex-rugby player Shane Donovan Moore was sentenced for a $900,000 Ponzi scheme. In Hong Kong , police arrested four people linked to a $382,000 investor fraud. The suspected ringleader fled overseas. The US oil scam shows how easily crypto can be misused across borders but it also shows that global enforcement is catching up fast."

2025-07-23 09:00:31+00:00,"Ethereum Demand Shock Will Rock Markets, Bitwise CIO Warns","A sudden surge of institutional and corporate interest in Ethereum (ETH) is setting the stage for what Bitwise Asset Management’s chief investment officer Matt Hougan calls a “structural imbalance” between supply and demand—one that could propel prices well beyond the cryptocurrency’s already‑rapid ascent this year. In a memo circulated to clients on 22 July 2025, Hougan noted that Ether has climbed more than 65 percent in the past month and over 160 percent since April. The rally, he argues, is being driven not by sentiment alone but by a dramatic mismatch between the amount of Ether produced by the network and the quantities now being absorbed by exchange‑traded products (ETPs) and newly formed “ETH treasury” corporations. Ethereum Demand Shock Is Inevitable “Sometimes it really is that simple,” Hougan wrote, echoing his long‑standing thesis that, in the short run, asset prices are dictated primarily by flows. He drew a direct parallel to bitcoin’s explosive performance following the launch of U.S. spot bitcoin ETPs in January 2024, when “ETPs, corporations, and governments acquired more than 1.5 million bitcoin, while the Bitcoin blockchain produced just over 300,000.” Related Reading: Ethereum To $10,000? Analyst Says ETH Has To Break This Level The same dynamic, he contends, has finally taken hold in the Ether market—only more forcefully. Between 15 May and 20 July, spot Ether ETPs attracted more than $5 billion in net inflows, while a handful of publicly traded companies began stockpiling the token as a primary treasury asset. Among the most aggressive buyers: Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) accumulated 300,657 ETH—about $1.13 billion at current prices—and declared an ambition “of obtaining 5 percent of all ETH supply.” SharpLink Gaming (SBET) purchased 280,706 ETH ($1.06 billion) and disclosed plans to raise an additional $6 billion for future acquisitions. Bit Digital (BTBT) liquidated its bitcoin reserves after raising $170 million, redirecting the proceeds to more than 100,000 ETH (roughly $375 million). The Ether Machine (DYNX) outlined an initial public offering built around a $1.6 billion Ether treasury. In aggregate, ETPs and public companies bought approximately 2.83 million Ether—valued at north of $10 billion—during the nine‑week stretch. Over the same period, the Ethereum network created only about 88,000 ETH in new issuance, a ratio of demand to supply that Hougan calculates at 32 to 1. “No wonder the price of ETH has soared,” he observed. Whether that pressure continues is now the central question for investors. Hougan’s answer is an unequivocal yes. He points out that, even after the recent buying spree, Ether remains under‑owned relative to bitcoin in the ETP market: Ether funds control less than 12 percent of the assets held by bitcoin ETPs, despite ETH’s market capitalisation standing at roughly one‑fifth of BTC’s. “With all the excitement surrounding stablecoins and tokenization—which are primarily built on Ethereum—we think that will change,” he said, predicting billions of dollars in additional inflows “in the next few months.” Related Reading: Tom Lee Predicts $30,000 Per Ethereum As Treasury Frenzy Begins Meanwhile, the economics of listed “crypto treasury” firms appear to be self‑reinforcing. Shares of BMNR and SBET each trade at nearly twice the net value of the Ether they hold, a premium that incentivises management teams to issue equity, raise capital, and purchase still more ETH. “As long as that remains true, you can bet Wall Street firms will funnel money into more ETH purchases,” Hougan wrote. Bitwise projects that ETPs and treasury companies could absorb as much as $20 billion worth of Ether—around 5.33 million coins at present prices—over the coming year. The protocol’s issuance schedule, by contrast, is expected to add only about 800,000 ETH to circulation during the same window, implying a 7‑to‑1 imbalance. “That’s an even higher ratio than we’ve seen for Bitcoin since the spot ETPs launched,” Hougan said. Sceptics often argue that Ether’s long‑term supply is not capped in the way bitcoin’s is, and that its valuation hinges on factors beyond simple scarcity, such as network usage and transaction fees. Hougan does not dispute those points but insists they are secondary in the near term. “In the short term, the price of everything is set by supply and demand, and right now, there is more demand for ETH than supply,” he concluded.

2025-07-23 09:11:25+00:00,Ray Dalio says Trump wants to weaken the dollar while Powell tries to defend it,"Ray Dalio says the fight between Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is about the value of money, not policy details. “When there is too much debt and borrowing,” Ray said, “the classic way of dealing with it is to push real interest rates down and devalue money.” Trump wants that. Powell doesn’t. That’s the whole fight. Ray explains it simply. Lowering real rates and inflating away debt helps debtors and hurts creditors. “That is what Donald Trump is pushing for and what Jay Powell is defending against.” It’s not new for presidents to want more stimulation. Every politician wants spending, markets up, happy voters. But central bankers are supposed to hold the line, not just give in to what’s popular. Normally, there’s respect for that line. Not now. Trump pushes devaluation while Powell resists it “This argument is more intense,” Ray says, even though debates between government and central banks are routine. Usually, central bankers “lean against the wind.” They try to find a balance between too much easing and too much tightening. Ray lays it out: when times are calm, the president wants happy voters and the central banker wants stable money. When things get rough, the president wants even more money printing, and the central banker starts losing control. That’s what’s happening now. Trump wants a cheaper dollar. Powell is trying to stop that slide. Then the question becomes: what should the Fed be doing? Ray says look at the data. Market indicators? “They are clearly saying that money is now easy and that the economy is not in trouble.” He points to stocks, credit spreads, and real interest rates. “Over the last year, the U.S. stock market was up 14%, is now at its all-time highs, and by most measures is expensive.” That’s not normal. That’s a signal that money is cheap. “The dollar was down 5% against a basket of other major currencies, down 27% against gold, and down 45% against Bitcoin.” Again, this isn’t stability. That’s market confidence fading. Credit spreads? “BAA-rated corporate spreads are now trading around 1% above Treasuries.” That’s historically tight. It means everyone expects money to stay cheap. “Real interest rates are relatively moderate and normal at a bit over 2% at the 10-year level.” That’s low. Not tight enough to defend the dollar. Dalio sees risks rising and the dollar getting weaker Economic indicators aren’t screaming trouble, but they aren’t perfect either. “The unemployment rate is at a relatively low 4.1% and slowly trending higher.” That means jobs are still strong, but weakening. “Tech, especially investments and revenues in AI, is booming while sentiment and real estate are weak.” So, there’s a split; big tech’s flying, but the average American isn’t. Ray adds that “the global economy is relatively weak.” So even if the U.S. is hanging in there, the rest of the world isn’t helping. Looking forward? He says the path is full of risk. “There are great uncertainties and risks related to the debt and trade issues, politics, and geopolitics that all have an inflationary bias.” But at the same time, “there are great technological advances that are deflationary and will tend to increase wealth gaps.” Ray says defending the value of money is a thankless job. “Defending monetary discipline, like defending fiscal discipline, isn’t a popular thing to do because it is de facto telling people that they need to have financial discipline.” Nobody wants to hear that. But the stakes are high. “One man’s debts are another man’s assets.” That’s not theory. That’s your money. If the Fed caves, your savings lose value. And that’s not going to be fixed by speeches. He asks the key question: “Will the value of money be defended?” And his answer? Not likely. “Judging from the lessons of history and current readings, I think that it is clear that the value of money won’t be defended until the classic weak money/inflation problems become intense, and perhaps not even then.” He brings up the 1970-1982 period, where inflation ran out of control and real rates had to be pushed sky high just to stop the bleeding. That’s the kind of pain it takes before monetary tightening is taken seriously. “So, while maybe that tightening will happen sometime in the distant future, it’s virtually certain that it won’t come soon.” That’s Ray’s warning. Don’t expect Powell to slam the brakes unless things totally fall apart. Until then, Ray has an advise take: “One should keep betting on weak money (i.e., the dollar going down, and low and falling real interest rates).” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ray-dalio-trump-powell-controlling-dollar/,MARKET|FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|BUSINESS,Economy|USD,BTC,"Ray Dalio says Trump wants to weaken the dollar while Powell tries to defend it.

Yesterday, July 22, Ethereum ETFs experienced one of their largest single-day inflows in two weeks, bringing in $533 million. Ethereum ETF Flow. Source: FarSide Investors In sharp contrast, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $68 million in outflows, a striking reversal that hints at a potential shift in institutional crypto appetite. This marks one of the biggest day-to-day divergences between the two flagship cryptos since spot Ethereum ETFs launched earlier this year. Some traders are now pointing to this move as a possible signal that ‘ altcoin season’ is getting underway. Institutions rush in Fidelity made one of the biggest single-day buys this week, with its Ethereum Fund (FETH) adding 33,788.82 ETH , roughly $124 million, in just one day. The purchase brings Fidelity’s total Ethereum holdings to 629,202 ETH, valued at approximately $2.33 billion at current market prices. But Fidelity isn’t alone in this institutional rush. BlackRock also expanded its Ethereum position, purchasing 27,158.86 ETH valued at nearly $100 million via its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). The asset management giant now holds 2.59 million ETH, making it the single-largest institutional holder of Ethereum among ETFs. The scale of institutional interest becomes clear when examining the broader picture.

2025-07-23 09:12:51+00:00,Bitcoin (BTC) Confirms Trend Break: Will Prices Surge Next?,"Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a triangle pattern on Tuesday and price has come back to confirm the breakout on Wednesday. Is it up from here, or can the bears still pull the price back down? $BTC surge coming sooner or later Investor greed is creeping higher as the $BTC price maintains above the $118,000 support level. The king of the cryptocurrencies is likely to power into its next surge higher sooner or later, as institutions pile into an asset, that with gold, is arguably the only sound money haven in an ocean of rapidly devaluing fiat currencies. Confirmation of the breakout? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart shows how the triangle pattern is evolving slightly in order to accommodate the $BTC price . A breakout did take place on Tuesday, and it looks like the confirmation of this break is occurring. Could the price sink back inside the triangle? Yes, of course, this is always an option, although the higher percentage chance is that a bounce would happen from here. One factor to take into consideration though is that the Stochastic RSI indicators are just on their way back down. This isn’t really conducive to a bounce to the upside, so perhaps the price could continue to slide down the top of the triangle until the bulls are good and ready to send it higher. If the bears do manage to wrest control from the bulls, a fall below $116,200 would be a time to sit up and start taking notice, as this could be the trigger for a rapid collapse to $112,000. $117,000 to $120,000 range has formed Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that a range is now forming after Tuesday’s top, with the top range defined as $120,000, while the bottom sits at around $117,000. The 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) is the blue ascending line. This does suggest the possibility that if there were to be a sudden violent shake out, the price could come down to retest the 50-day SMA, which just might be at that $112,000 level by that time. At the bottom of the chart, the daily Stochastic RSI indicators are coming down nicely and could be expected to hit bottom by the end of this week. This could result in a signal of increased upside price momentum towards the end of the following week. Steeper rise for this bull market over the previous one Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly chart view gives one more of a perspective on just how sharply the $BTC price is rising. Taking the 2021/2022 bull market as a comparison, if one looks at the tilt of the main moving averages (50, 100, 200) and then compares this with how these moving averages are climbing currently, it is noticeable that there is a steeper tilt to all of them this time around. This could be because the last bull market was somewhat curtailed, given the FTX collapse, and the huge amount of leverage that was being utilised. This time around things are different. The US government is squarely behind encouraging Bitcoin and crypto adoption, and institutions are starting to buy Bitcoin for their treasuries. Pensions are also starting to allocate. Bitcoin may be in a short-term holding phase at the moment, but this isn’t likely to last long. Bitcoin is disappearing off of OTC desks (over the counter) rapidly and a resulting supply crunch may be coming. Continuing to hold Bitcoin looks like a wise move.

Yes, of course, this is always an option, although the higher percentage chance is that a bounce would happen from here. One factor to take into consideration though is that the Stochastic RSI indicators are just on their way back down. This isn’t really conducive to a bounce to the upside, so perhaps the price could continue to slide down the top of the triangle until the bulls are good and ready to send it higher. If the bears do manage to wrest control from the bulls, a fall below $116,200 would be a time to sit up and start taking notice, as this could be the trigger for a rapid collapse to $112,000. $117,000 to $120,000 range has formed Source: TradingView The daily chart reveals that a range is now forming after Tuesday’s top, with the top range defined as $120,000, while the bottom sits at around $117,000. The 50-day SMA (Simple Moving Average) is the blue ascending line. This does suggest the possibility that if there were to be a sudden violent shake out, the price could come down to retest the 50-day SMA, which just might be at that $112,000 level by that time. At the bottom of the chart, the daily Stochastic RSI indicators are coming down nicely and could be expected to hit bottom by the end of this week. This could result in a signal of increased upside price momentum towards the end of the following week. Steeper rise for this bull market over the previous one Source: TradingView Zooming out into the weekly chart view gives one more of a perspective on just how sharply the $BTC price is rising. Taking the 2021/2022 bull market as a comparison, if one looks at the tilt of the main moving averages (50, 100, 200) and then compares this with how these moving averages are climbing currently, it is noticeable that there is a steeper tilt to all of them this time around. This could be because the last bull market was somewhat curtailed, given the FTX collapse, and the huge amount of leverage that was being utilised. This time around things are different. The US government is squarely behind encouraging Bitcoin and crypto adoption, and institutions are starting to buy Bitcoin for their treasuries. Pensions are also starting to allocate. Bitcoin may be in a short-term holding phase at the moment, but this isn’t likely to last long. Bitcoin is disappearing off of OTC desks (over the counter) rapidly and a resulting supply crunch may be coming. Continuing to hold Bitcoin looks like a wise move.

2025-07-23 09:15:32+00:00,Billionaire Binance Founder Says ‘FOMO Season Soon’ as Altcoin Index Starts Ticking Up,"Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has pointed out that CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index is starting to climb, predicting that an altcoin rally might be imminent. Key Takeaways: Binance founder CZ says the Altcoin Season Index is ticking up, hinting at a possible FOMO-driven rally. The index has climbed to 51, up from 16 last month, signaling rising momentum toward altcoins. Ethereum and meme coins are leading gains, mirroring past cycles where altcoins outperformed Bitcoin. “Not sure how accurate it is, but it is ticking up. FOMO season soon…” Zhao posted on X, referencing the index that tracks whether altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin over a 90-day period. The statement comes as Bitcoin’s dominance rate continues to drop, indicating that traders are increasingly focusing on the broader cryptocurrency market. Altcoin Season Index Climbs to 51, Up from 16 Last Month The Altcoin Season Index, maintained by CoinMarketCap , currently sits at 51 out of 100, up from 38 last week and just 16 a month ago. A reading above 75 indicates an official “ Altcoin Season, ” where at least 75 of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the previous 90 days. While 51 falls short of that threshold, the momentum reflects growing market rotation into non-Bitcoin assets. Historically, these phases follow a predictable pattern: Bitcoin rallies first, lifting overall sentiment and liquidity. Ethereum and other altcoins then pick up, fueled by narrative-driven speculation, new protocol launches, and increased developer activity. In the 2021 altcoin season, for instance, top altcoins posted gains over 170%, compared to Bitcoin’s 2% during the same period. Current data supports that pattern. Ethereum is up 110% over the past 90 days, while meme coins like BONK (+148.7%) and FLOKI (+119.1%) have surged. Even lower-cap projects such as PENGU and M have posted gains exceeding 500%, according to CoinMarketCap’s 90-day performance chart. The methodology behind the index excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens and instead focuses on price performance among the top 100 coins listed on CoinMarketCap. The goal is to help investors gauge market sentiment shifts between Bitcoin-dominated periods and broader altcoin rallies. Bitcoin Dominnace Falls Sharply Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto market has fallen sharply, dropping 5.8% in just one week to under 61%, its lowest point since March, and the steepest decline since June 2022. The metric had peaked near 66% at the end of last month, according to TradingView. The drop in dominance coincides with a surge in total crypto market capitalization, which has jumped from $3 trillion to around $3.8 trillion over the past three weeks. Altcoins, particularly Ethereum, have led the rally as investors shift focus away from Bitcoin. “Everyone is saying ALTSEASON has started but if you look at indicator they say ~ Not yet,” X user Henry said in a recent post . They added that none of the 30 bull market top indicators have triggered yet, with Bitcoin dominance at 61%, the Altcoin Season Index at 51, and key metrics like Puell, MVRV Z-Score, and Mayer Multiple still in safe territory.

Last month, Donna Nestler, a resident of Monticello, New York, allegedly stole $219,000 from her long-term friend’s Bank of America account using a fake identification card, reports the KMZU news radio station. According to an investigation by the Daviess County Sheriff’s Office in Missouri, Nestler allegedly stole the funds between June 2nd and June 9th from the bank account of the unidentified victim, who is a resident of Daviess County. The Daviess County Sheriff’s Office has issued an arrest warrant for Nestler. Authorities say the victim was able to identify the thief using surveillance images of the bank transactions. Nestler allegedly flew from New York to Nevada and then back to New York to steal the money. According to a separate report by KTTN news radio station, Nestler used a falsified driver’s license under the victim’s identity to steal the funds. The victim reportedly discovered the transactions on June 6th, when she locked her account and filed a dispute of the charges with Bank of America. However, Nestler allegedly was able to once again access the victim’s account on June 9th to withdraw an additional $9,520.

2025-07-23 09:16:25+00:00,DOJ moves to recover $7M in crypto tied to oil and gas investment scam,"US regulators have moved to recover over $7 million in cryptocurrencies seized by Homeland Security during an investigation into a suspected oil and gas investment scam. The Seattle US Attorney’s Office has filed a civil forfeiture action to claim the digital assets, which were allegedly used to launder proceeds from the fraudulent scheme. The funds were part of a $97 million scam that defrauded investors between June 2022 and July 2024. According to Acting US Attorney Teal Luthy Miller, the defendants transferred the illicit gains through various cryptocurrency accounts in an attempt to obscure their origin and avoid detection. The seized assets include crypto held in wallets linked to individuals based in Russia and Nigeria, who allegedly routed part of the funds to exchanges in their home countries. Scammers promised unrealistic gains; one was indicted An initial probe found that victims were lured with promises of high returns from investments in oil tank storage facilities in Rotterdam and Houston. They were told that these assets would be rented out for substantial profits. However, after the money was sent, the operators stopped responding, and the investors received no documentation or further contact. According to Investigators, the funds were directed to several business entities, including Sea Forest International LLC and Apex Oil and Gas Trading LLC, which were used as fronts for the operation. The fraud also involved multiple accounts and wallets to obscure money flows. Geoffrey Auyeung, a 47-year-old from Newcastle, Washington, was indicted in August 2024 as the primary US-based co-conspirator. Authorities alleged he received a large share of the proceeds and converted the funds into Bitcoin, Tether, USDC, and Ether. A portion of the funds was transferred to Binance. At the time of his arrest, the DOJ seized approximately $2.3 million from Auyeung’s bank accounts. If the court grants the $7.1 million forfeiture request, the total recovered amount will rise to $9.4 million, which will be distributed to confirmed victims. Prosecutors have so far identified around $17.9 million in verified losses but expect more victims to come forward. DOJ’s focus on recovery efforts With billions lost to fraud in 2024, according to FBI estimates , federal authorities have continued to pursue cross-border enforcement and prosecutions. Over the past month, the Justice Department, in particular, has been busy pursuing recovery actions tied to various crypto fraud cases In June, the DOJ filed a civil complaint to seize over $225 million in Tether linked to a massive pig butchering scheme that defrauded more than 400 victims globally. Bad actors were found to be using blockchain-based laundering tools to mask the origin of the stolen funds. However, authorities were able to trace the assets with assistance from stablecoin issuer Tether. Just weeks later, the DOJ recovered $40,300 in USDT following a phishing scam involving impersonation of the Trump-Vance Inaugural Committee. A donor was tricked into transferring $250,300 in crypto after receiving a fake email request. The scam was uncovered, and with help from Tether , part of the funds was successfully retrieved. Separately, the DOJ resolved a $35 million crypto dispute with bankrupt lender BlockFi. The department had initially sought to seize the assets as part of a criminal fraud case involving Estonian nationals. The settlement, approved in June, allowed the funds to be removed from the bankruptcy estate and concluded the case without further litigation.

2025-07-23 09:18:07+00:00,"ETHT: 2x Ether ETF, Up Over 100% In The Past Month","Summary ETHT offers 2x daily leveraged exposure to ether, making it a highly speculative tool for short-term momentum trading, not long-term investing. The ETF structure provides regulated, transparent access to ether futures, reducing risks of exchange fraud compared to direct crypto trading. Due to extreme volatility and drawdowns, investors can gain or lose capital rapidly with ETHT. ETHT is best used with clear entry and exit points by sophisticated traders seeking amplified ether exposure, not for buy-and-hold strategies. Thesis Cryptocurrencies used to be a fringe market traded on specific exchanges that occasionally blew up . Nowadays, crypto is an established asset class that has permeated the traditional investment ecosystem, and retail investors have access to crypto via exchange-traded funds. Not only can one buy ether via an ETF now, but one can leverage up via the advent of leveraged ETFs in the space. In today''s article, we are going to discuss exactly such a fund, namely the Proshares Ultra Ether ETF ( ETHT ). We are going to go through the fund''s structure and history and highlight for investors what the name does and why it is purely a speculative tool. Crypto in the ETF format The crypto asset class has been historically plagued by many scandals, such as the Mt. Gox and FTX occurrences, where investors lost significant amounts of money. The transitioning to traditional finance ensured the checks and balances that have been refined for many years now apply to cryptocurrencies such as ether. Investors using ETHT for ether exposure can rest assured that the framework for their purchase is tried and tested, and in fact, as we shall see in the holdings section, the fund has ether futures as holdings, thus cutting out any possibilities of exchange-related fraud. What does the fund actually do? Now let us take a look at the fund objective: This ProShares ETF seeks daily investment results that correspond, before fees and expenses, to 2x the daily performance of its underlying benchmark, the Bloomberg Ethereum Index. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a single ether traded in USD. The Index is constructed and maintained by Bloomberg Index Services Limited. While the Fund has a daily investment objective, you may hold Fund shares for longer than one day if you believe it is consistent with your goals and risk tolerance. The name aims to provide the 2x daily performance of ether. While on crypto dedicated platforms investors can easily obtain leverage, the ETF asset class needs dedicated funds for enhanced returns. And ETHT is exactly such a fund. Please note that, just like any leveraged instrument, the fund aims to provide a 2x return only on a daily basis: For any holding period other than a day, your return may be higher or lower than the Daily Target. These differences may be significant. Smaller index gains/losses and higher index volatility contribute to returns worse than the Daily Target. Larger index gains/losses and lower index volatility contribute to returns better than the Daily Target. The above is the standard disclosure regarding leveraged names, and investors should always read the following from FINRA : Most leveraged and inverse ETFs reset each day, which means they are designed to achieve their stated objective on a daily basis. With the effects of compounding, over longer timeframes the results can differ significantly from their objective. Please see Regulatory Notice 09-31 and the SEC/FINRA Investor Alert for illustrations of how these discrepancies can occur. Because they reset each day, leveraged and inverse ETFs typically are inappropriate as an intermediate or long-term investment. They may be appropriate, however, if recommended as part of a sophisticated trading or hedging strategy that will be closely monitored by a financial professional. However, a registered representative must carefully address the question of how to engage in these strategies in a manner consistent with the suitability rule. When to use it Just like regular equities or commodities funds, the ether ecosystem in the ETF format consists of regular 1x funds and now a 2x instrument: Ether 1x ETF: iShares Ethereum Trust ETF ( ETHA ) Ether 2x ETF: Proshares Ultra Ether ETF Speculative investors who want to enhance their exposure to the asset class for a very short period of time can get access to a larger notional via a leveraged fund such as ETHT. At the end of the day, the ETF ensures that an investor with the same $100 of capital can get 2x the returns for ether.

Community Response and Aggressive Targets While Crypto Fergani’s chart implies that $12 may be a realistic near-term goal, some community members see it as a conservative projection.

With Trump Media investing $2 Billion and MicroStrategy shelling out another $800 Million, everyone’s now glued to the million-dollar question: will Bitcoin hit $250,000 by 2025? Even as the big guns double down on wagers, fly-under-the-radar newcomers like Remittix are making waves off the grid delivering in-the-real-world utility and the power to redefine the usage of crypto on the world stage. Big Money, Bigger Bets: What’s Fueling Bitcoin’s Surge? Bitcoin currently trades at around $118,951.53, CoinMarketCap shows, with the market cap going up over $2.36 Trillion. Volume rises over 16% now to $76.33 Billion, another sign of rising institutional demand. With MicroStrategy and Trump Media joining in on the action, it’s no question that Bitcoin remains the institutional crypto play to beat. The majority now anticipate a new wave of institutional capital coming in something that will drive BTC to $250,000 sooner than expected. More and more investors are searching for the next great altcoin of 2025, but Bitcoin’s dominance is hard to ignore. Bloomberg and Fidelity analysts have also noted long-term bullish trends as an indicator that this can be a high-growth crypto breakout year. Remittix: The Real-World Use Case Crypto Can’t Ignore While Bitcoin makes the headlines, Remittix (RTX) makes history behind the scenes. Having raised over $16.7 Million, sold 562 Million+ tokens and a current price of as little as $0.0842, Remittix is positioning itself as the best DeFi altcoin for 2025. What makes Remittix different? It’s not vaporware or meme currency. It’s a DeFi project that is audited, enabling real-time crypto-to-bank transfers in over 30 nations. It bridges low gas fee crypto to payments in the real world, solving a $19 Trillion issue of international remittances. Why RTX is gaining serious traction: Wallet Launching Q3: App with seamless FX conversion $16.7 Million+: One of the top early-stage crypto investments 50% Bonus Tokens Alive: Only a few million from soft cap $250, 000 RTX Giveaway: Exclusive to presale participants Real Use Case: Send crypto to bank accounts in seconds In addition to utility, Remittix also excites those with a stake in staking cryptocurrency, cross-chain DeFi and early tokenomics access. With centralized exchanges and decentralized exchange integration on the table, RTX is one of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in today. What’s Next for Bitcoin and Crypto in 2025? The Bitcoin rally is a sign but not the only one. With Trump and Saylor now fully invested, the market is clearly hungry for crypto with real utility. But real growth will be spurred by more than just speculation. Tokens such as Remittix are preparing for the next phase of crypto adoption: true users and usage, not mania to invest but real people and consumption. If Bitcoin goes to $250,000, it’ll bring the whole market with it but utility-focussed tokens such as RTX will be shining. Don’t miss this chance. Presale is heating up and time’s short.

2025-07-23 09:30:00+00:00,SEC Approves Then Stays Bitwise Crypto ETF Conversion,"The fund includes top assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, and was granted accelerated approval before being stayed by the Commission for further review. Industry analysts compared the move to a similar delay experienced by Grayscale and speculate the pause may be tied to internal SEC politics or a broader effort to create new crypto ETF listing standards. Meanwhile, 21Shares filed for a spot ETF tracking the price of Ondo (ONDO), the native token of the Ondo Chain, which focuses on institutional-grade tokenized real-world assets. This filing was made after Ondo Finance’s acquisition of regulated broker-dealer Oasis Pro to strengthen its position in the booming RWA market. Bitwise Crypto ETF in Limbo The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved, and then promptly paused, the conversion of Bitwise’s crypto index fund into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). Bitwise’s 10 Crypto Index Fund (traded under BITW) includes exposure to leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It received an “accelerated approval” from the SEC’s Division of Trading and Markets. This designation would have allowed Bitwise to request earlier activation of its ETF status. However, in an unusual twist, the same day saw the SEC issue a stay on that approval, pending a full Commission review. (Source: SEC ) The move immediately sparked comparisons to a similar delay involving Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap ETF, which was also approved and then paused shortly thereafter. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart explained that the approval was stayed by one or more SEC commissioners, which now prevents Bitwise from proceeding with the conversion for the time being. He pointed out that the timing was earlier than expected, as the decision wasn’t due until the following week. Naturally, the pause drew a lot of reactions from people in the industry. Nate Geraci , president of NovaDius Wealth Management, called the situation “bizarre,” while Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital speculated that the approval was rushed under delegated authority to circumvent potential opposition from SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw. Johnsson also theorized the delay could be part of a strategy by SEC Chair Paul Atkins to avoid the constraints of the 240-day statutory period that is required for final ETF approvals. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas added that the SEC might be intentionally stalling ETF conversions while it works to establish a comprehensive listing standard for crypto ETFs. He suggested that new generic guidelines could be announced soon, which would include a public comment period and implementation before the upcoming deadlines in October. Meanwhile, the SEC also extended its decision timeline on whether to allow in-kind redemptions for Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. According to journalist Eleanor Terrett, discussions are ongoing among the SEC, fund managers, and stock exchanges on how to streamline the approval process for certain crypto-related investment products. This could suggest that broader structural changes may be on the horizon. 21Shares Files for Ondo Spot ETF Meanwhile, 21Shares filed a preliminary prospectus with the US SEC for a new exchange-traded product that will track the spot price of Ondo, the native token of the decentralized finance protocol Ondo Finance. The proposed “21Shares Ondo Trust” is designed to passively hold ONDO tokens, with performance benchmarked to the CME CF Ondo Finance-Dollar Reference Rate. Coinbase was tapped to provide custody services for the fund’s assets. 21Shares Ondo ETF filing (Source: SEC ) The product is intended to serve as a straightforward investment vehicle without any use of speculation or leverage. Investors will be able to create or redeem shares either in cash or in-kind. Ondo , which is the underlying token, powers the Ondo Chain. This is a layer-1 proof-of-stake blockchain purpose-built for institutional-grade financial markets and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). With a circulating supply of 3.1 billion tokens and a total cap of 10 billion, Ondo currently trades around $1.11. This means it is down almost 48% from its December all-time high of $2.14. Its total market capitalization stands at $3.5 billion. ONDO all-time price action (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Ondo Finance also attracted attention from the Trump family’s decentralized finance venture, World Liberty Financial, which bought $250,000 worth of ONDO tokens in December. It currently holds 342,000 tokens valued at roughly $383,000, but this is only a minor 0.2% fraction of its $208 million portfolio that mainly consists of stablecoins, wrapped Ether, and Bitcoin.

2025-07-23 09:35:15+00:00,JPMorgan Explores Crypto-Backed Loans and Stablecoins as Bitcoin Hyper Surges,"JPMorgan is reportedly exploring directly lending $BTC and $ETH by 2026, while also turning its attention to stablecoins. The largest bank worldwide possibly accepting crypto as collateral is a huge deal. It confirms that traditional banking entities are finally taking crypto seriously. It’s also a major win for Layer 2 (L2) solutions, like Bitcoin Hyper . As more institutional investors gravitate to $BTC, the need for faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin infrastructure grows. Bitcoin Hyper is in a prime position to support this increased demand. JPMorgan Might Step Into Crypto Alongside Morgan Stanley JPMorgan’s favorable crypto stance comes after years of skepticism from Jamie Dimon, the bank’s CEO. Back in 2017, Dimon called $BTC a ‘fraud’ and said that he’d ‘fire any employee trading $BTC on the company’s accounts.’ Years later, his viewpoint hadn’t softened much. In January 2025, he referred to $BTC as ‘a Ponzi scheme’ and ‘as useless as a pet rock.’ But now, just months later, he seems to have come around. And it’s no wonder. Other banking giants are entering the Web3 arena, and JPMorgan is unlikely to want to be left behind. Morgan Stanley, for instance, plans to roll out crypto trading on its E*Trade platform in 2026, allowing clients to buy and sell $BTC and $ETH directly. Still, as the biggest TradFi player internationally, JPMorgan offering crypto-backed loans would mark one of the most significant institutional validations of digital assets to date. Especially if $BTC (currently trading at over $118K ) becomes acceptable collateral on Wall Street. And that happening isn’t far-fetched, as institutions are already treating $BTC as a core asset. For example, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) holds over $72B in $BTC, which places it ninth among all S&P 500 firms by treasury size, ahead of heavyweights, like Exxon, NVIDIA, PayPal, and CVS. However, as demand for the #1 crypto continues to skyrocket (also propelled by Donald Trump praising $BTC as ‘the world’s first public digital payments infrastructure’), network congestion and high fees on the original Bitcoin network are inevitable. But fear not. This is where Bitcoin Hyper comes in. Bitcoin Hyper to Fix Bitcoin’s Flaws Ahead of Wall Street Demand Once launched in Q3 2025, Bitcoin Hyper sets out to fix some of the Bitcoin network’s biggest woes – slow transaction speeds, high fees, and limited smart contract capabilities. Integrated with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , it aims to bring high-performance dApp functionality to Bitcoin. As a result, it’ll unlock use cases that were previously only possible on other blockchain networks, like Ethereum. To create a faster, cheaper, and more scalable user experience, it’ll leverage a Canonical Bridge , enabling $BTC to switch between Bitcoin’s L1 and L2. And all will be achieved without sacrificing decentralization, which is the core principle of blockchain tech, after all. $HYPER is the linchpin of the entire ecosystem. It facilitates governance rights and staking rewards at a sizable 221% APY. Once the L2 officially launches, it’ll also help you save funds on gas fees. Given that a whopping 30% of $HYPER is earmarked for development, major investors are making strategic moves to get the most out of the ecosystem and reap the perks. Since going live on presale on May 16, 2025, $HYPER has raised $4.3M+. Whale buyers have significantly propelled its growth, three of whom invested $74.9K , $54.1K , and $53.9K . Grab $HYPER for Potential 2,400%+ Returns If banking titans like JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley officially enter the crypto realm, they’ll accelerate the mainstream adoption of $BTC. And as $BTC gains more Wall Street traction, the need for faster and more cost-friendly infrastructure becomes vital. Luckily, Bitcoin Hyper steps in to meet this demand. To get the most out of the ecosystem, you can purchase $HYPER on presale for as little as $0.012375, using either $USDT, $ETH, $USDC, $BNB, or fiat. Following its L2 launch, it could reach $0.32 before 2026 kicks off, which means there’s no better time to join the presale for possible returns surpassing 2,400%. This isn’t financial advice.

JPMorgan is reportedly exploring directly lending $BTC and $ETH by 2026, while also turning its attention to stablecoins. The largest bank worldwide possibly accepting crypto as collateral is a huge deal. It confirms that traditional banking entities are finally taking crypto seriously. It’s also a major win for Layer 2 (L2) solutions, like Bitcoin Hyper . As more institutional investors gravitate to $BTC, the need for faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin infrastructure grows. Bitcoin Hyper is in a prime position to support this increased demand. JPMorgan Might Step Into Crypto Alongside Morgan Stanley JPMorgan’s favorable crypto stance comes after years of skepticism from Jamie Dimon, the bank’s CEO. Back in 2017, Dimon called $BTC a ‘fraud’ and said that he’d ‘fire any employee trading $BTC on the company’s accounts.’ Years later, his viewpoint hadn’t softened much. In January 2025, he referred to $BTC as ‘a Ponzi scheme’ and ‘as useless as a pet rock.’ But now, just months later, he seems to have come around. And it’s no wonder. Other banking giants are entering the Web3 arena, and JPMorgan is unlikely to want to be left behind. Morgan Stanley, for instance, plans to roll out crypto trading on its E*Trade platform in 2026, allowing clients to buy and sell $BTC and $ETH directly. Still, as the biggest TradFi player internationally, JPMorgan offering crypto-backed loans would mark one of the most significant institutional validations of digital assets to date. Especially if $BTC (currently trading at over $118K ) becomes acceptable collateral on Wall Street. And that happening isn’t far-fetched, as institutions are already treating $BTC as a core asset. For example, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) holds over $72B in $BTC, which places it ninth among all S&P 500 firms by treasury size, ahead of heavyweights, like Exxon, NVIDIA, PayPal, and CVS. However, as demand for the #1 crypto continues to skyrocket (also propelled by Donald Trump praising $BTC as ‘the world’s first public digital payments infrastructure’), network congestion and high fees on the original Bitcoin network are inevitable. But fear not. This is where Bitcoin Hyper comes in.

2025-07-23 09:47:32+00:00,Strategy''s 4th Preferred Stock: STRC Is Here To Attack Money Market Funds,"Summary Strategy''s capital structure is a masterclass in financial engineering, creating a Bitcoin-backed yield curve to attract diverse investor capital efficiently. The new STRC preferred stock is designed as a low-duration, high-yield instrument to directly compete with money market funds, offering superior yield and stability. STRC''s price stabilization mechanisms ensure principal preservation and yield competitiveness, drawing capital away from traditional cash equivalents and fueling further Bitcoin accumulation. I remain bullish on Strategy''s common and preferreds, as each issuance strengthens the capital stack, increases intrinsic value, and perpetuates the Bitcoin accumulation flywheel. If you’ve been following my coverage of Strategy’s ( MSTR ) capital structure, you know I’m a firm believer in Saylor’s vision to develop Strategy into the ultimate levered Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) investment vehicle by essentially selling superior financial securities to the market. I previously covered ( STRK ) and ( STRF ) extensively here and here , while my previous article on STRD, their third preferred stock, highlighted how Saylor’s financial engineering creates a self-reinforcing flywheel, capturing capital from diverse investor classes to fuel Bitcoin accumulation. With STRC (STRC), Strategy takes this utterly corporate finance textbook-shuttering plan to a new level, introducing a low-duration, high-yield security designed to compete directly with money market funds. So, beyond further opening up its capital stack, Strategy is set to optimize its yield curve further. In fact, as I am about to explain, Strategy is setting itself to attract capital at unprecedented efficiency through STRC by creating what you can think of as a ""black hole"" in the world of short-term yield parking. Building the Yield Curve We have so far witnessed how Strategy''s capital structure is a carefully crafted ecosystem, with each preferred (STRK, STRF, STRD, and now STRC) serving a distinct purpose in attracting capital from different investor profiles, which, in turn, Strategy leverages by attaching an at-the-money offering program. By issuing securities with varying risk/reward characteristics, Saylor and Co. is effectively building a Bitcoin-backed yield curve, where each instrument settles a specific niche in terms of duration, yield, and seniority. This system enables Strategy to tap into a broad spectrum of capital markets, ranging from risk-tolerant equity investors ( MSTR ) to conservative fixed-income seekers ( STRF ), to those seeking a middle ground ( STRK ) or even those willing to sit at a lower seniority level for higher yield ( STRD ), while minimizing financing costs and maximizing Bitcoin accumulation. MSTR''s Yield Curve (STRC IPO Presentation) In my previous article, I explained how the introduction of STRD, a high-yield, junior preferred stock with a 10% dividend, was an indirect move to elevate the creditworthiness of STRF, the senior-most preferred in the capital stack. By offering a “junky” security with the exact same 10% yield as STRF, Strategy effectively pushed STRF’s perceived safety higher, encouraging investors to bid up its price above par, thus lowering its effective yield. This dynamic has allowed Strategy to issue STRF at a premium, raising capital at a lower cost while reinforcing the collateral base backing the entire capital structure. The result is a virtuous cycle where each new issuance strengthens the senior securities, attracts more capital, and funds further Bitcoin buys. MSTR''s Preferred Stock Yields (STRC IPO Presentation) You can see in the chart above how my prediction played out quite accurately. The moment STRD entered the chat, the market has been chasing all three preferreds higher in order for each to more accurately reflect its underlying risk/reward ratio. The reality that the market is also getting increasingly educated about how these products are indeed superior to their tradfi peers (i.e., STRF is a superior credit instrument versus any other super long-term competitor, from the 30-Y US bond to Austria''s 100-Y government bond ) has also contributed to this rally. It’s also clear that capital keeps flowing steadily into Strategy’s preferreds, especially when you compare them to the broader market. Just look at the underwhelming performance of the iShares Preferred and Income Securities ETF ( PFF ), which has lagged well behind. Again, this makes total sense as Strategy''s preferreds are structurally superior in every shape or form, including the fact that they are overcollateralized multiple times over against Strategy''s BTC holdings. MSTR''s Preferreds vs. PFF (STRC IPO Presentation) STRC: The Money Market Competitor Now, here comes STRC, a perpetual preferred stock with a variable monthly dividend , initially set to deliver a high yield but (in my view) engineered to stabilize just above money market fund rates.

ECOS ECOS is another trusted platform that lets users get cloud mining contracts through its Android and iOS apps. Via the app, you can always check the miner’s active hashrate, profits, and prizes. Yet, even though ECOS includes options for portfolio diversification (including wallets and portfolios), it charges more fees and doesn’t hand out free mining energy when you create an account like MiningToken does. Pros: Ease of using the system Provides the chance to invest in several cryptos at once Unlimited contract options are open to today’s miners. Cons: There are higher minimum amounts you must invest Rates of return in Bitcoin are mostly affected by its extreme price changes. Hashing24 Hashing24 makes things simple and trustworthy for its users. Since the dashboard is not a real app but only a responsive website, users can conveniently monitor mining contracts while away from their computers. They rent the hardware needed for mining from Iceland and Georgia’s top-rated mines. Although these companies are respected, some people might not like them as much, due to the fact that there’s no free trial and the contract terms are not flexible. Pros: Mining contracts backed by real facilities No hidden costs Reliable payout history Cons: No flexible short-term contracts No signup bonuses for new users Conclusion: Although many apps provide cloud mining, MiningToken gives you the best set of features. There are no charges for free contracts that you can use. AI is used for optimizing projects. Mining that is friendly to the environment Clear income earnings Constantly getting your earnings in little time Anyone from Switzerland looking for extra flexibility will find that MiningToken is the top option.

2025-07-23 09:55:21+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Alert: Decoding the Sudden Drop Below $118,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Alert: Decoding the Sudden Drop Below $118,000 The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with the latest market movement: Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, has recently experienced a significant tumble, falling below the $118,000 mark. This crucial development has sent ripples across the entire crypto ecosystem, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to ponder the immediate implications and future trajectory of the Bitcoin price . According to real-time market monitoring by Bitcoin World, BTC was observed trading at $117,968 on the Binance USDT market. This dip, while not unprecedented in Bitcoin’s volatile history, certainly commands attention and warrants a deeper dive into its potential causes and consequences. For anyone invested in or considering entering the crypto space, understanding these market shifts is absolutely essential. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Movement? When the Bitcoin price takes a notable dip, it’s rarely due to a single, isolated event. Instead, it’s typically a complex interplay of various factors, both internal to the crypto market and external macroeconomic forces. Understanding these triggers is key to interpreting market behavior. Macroeconomic Headwinds: The broader global economic landscape significantly influences risk-on assets like Bitcoin. Concerns over persistent inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks (such as the Federal Reserve), and geopolitical tensions can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, pulling funds from more speculative assets. When traditional markets show signs of instability, the ripple effect often reaches the crypto market, impacting the Bitcoin price . Market Sentiment and FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt): The cryptocurrency market is highly sensitive to news and rumors. Negative regulatory news from major economies, concerns over the solvency of crypto exchanges or lending platforms, or even widespread social media speculation can quickly erode investor confidence. This FUD can trigger panic selling, creating a downward spiral for prices. Technical Analysis Breakdowns: Professional traders and algorithms often rely on technical indicators and support levels. When the Bitcoin price breaks below a significant psychological or technical support level, such as the $118,000 mark, it can trigger automatic sell orders and encourage further selling pressure as traders anticipate continued declines. Whale Activity: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can exert considerable influence on the market. A significant sell-off by one or more whales can inject a large supply of Bitcoin into the market, overwhelming demand and causing a rapid decline in price. Tracking these large movements is a constant endeavor for market analysts. Liquidity Issues: While Bitcoin is highly liquid, sudden large sell orders in a specific market can temporarily overwhelm buying interest, especially if liquidity is concentrated on a few exchanges. This can lead to rapid price discovery downwards until new buyers step in. The confluence of these factors often creates a perfect storm, leading to sharp corrections in the Bitcoin price , reminding us of the inherent volatility that defines this innovative asset class. The Immediate Impact on Bitcoin Price and the Wider Market A sudden drop in Bitcoin price below a key level like $118,000 doesn’t just affect Bitcoin itself; it sends tremors throughout the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The immediate aftermath can be a period of heightened uncertainty and rapid re-evaluation for all market participants. Investor Reaction and Sentiment: For many investors, a sharp decline triggers a mix of fear and opportunity. Some may panic sell to cut losses, contributing to further downward pressure. Others, particularly those with a long-term conviction, may view it as a ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, looking to accumulate more Bitcoin at a perceived discount. This divergence in reaction often creates choppy market conditions. Altcoin Correlation: Bitcoin is often considered the bellwether of the crypto market. When the Bitcoin price moves significantly, altcoins (alternative cryptocurrencies) tend to follow suit. A drop in BTC usually leads to a corresponding decline across most altcoins, although some may experience more severe percentage losses due to their smaller market caps and higher volatility. Projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano often see their prices influenced heavily by Bitcoin’s performance. Liquidation Events: For traders using leverage, a sharp drop in price can trigger forced liquidations. When the value of their collateral falls below a certain threshold, exchanges automatically close their positions to prevent further losses, which can amplify selling pressure and accelerate the price decline in a cascading effect. This is a particularly dangerous aspect of highly leveraged trading during volatile periods.

2025-07-23 10:00:08+00:00,"Whales Are Buying This Altcoin Set to Rise 20%, Just as Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilizes Near $120,000 After New ATH","Bitcoin (BTC)’s recent surge to nearly $120,000 has investors buzzing, marking an exciting new all-time high in the crypto world. This milestone signals renewed confidence among large institutional players, who are now beginning to rotate profits into promising altcoins that promise faster, more explosive growth. While Layer-1 blockchains such as Sui focus on technical upgrades like speed and scalability, the financial upside offered by certain altcoins is capturing more attention from savvy investors. One such token is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized lending platform poised to deliver rapid returns that could far outpace slow-moving tech improvements. As whales increase their stakes, MUTM stands out not just for its innovative DeFi protocols but also for its strong presale momentum and well-structured roadmap. Bitcoin (BTC) Stabilizes Bitcoin (BTC) stabilized around $119,750 as of July 21, 2025, after hitting a new all-time high of $123,153 on July 14, driven by $2.7 billion in weekly ETF inflows, per Reuters. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, holding over 700,000 BTC, led with $1.18 billion in single-day inflows, boosting institutional demand. The CLARITY Act and pro-crypto policies during “Crypto Week” fueled optimism, with X posts noting a 13% monthly gain. A bullish three white soldiers pattern targets $125,000-$136,000 by Q4 2025, per Ledn’s CEO, though an overbought RSI (75) and $445 million in short liquidations suggest a potential dip to $116,500-$117,000. Long-term holder accumulation (250,000 BTC) and rising transactions (364,000 daily) signal sustained momentum, but tariff uncertainties and miner outflows could spark volatility, keeping BTC’s trajectory in a delicate balance. What Is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will be a decentralized lending platform built on a fast Layer-2 network, offering two distinct models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C model, users will be able to deposit assets like $28,000 MATIC into a lending pool and earn a projected 13.8% APY—yielding $3,864 in passive income annually. Borrowers, on the other hand, will be able to put blue-chip tokens such as $2,800 worth of ADA at 70% LTV to instantly borrow $1,960 in USDT, with flexible repayment and no penalties. Meanwhile, the P2P model will support risk-adjusted lending backed by volatile assets like memecoins. Users will negotiate terms directly, unlocking higher yield opportunities with smart contract safeguards. All earnings will be tracked through mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens that grow in value automatically, can be transferred, and staked for extra rewards via MUTM buybacks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale has attracted tremendous interest, with Phase 5 nearly complete. Out of a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, $12.9 million has been raised, and 90% of tokens allocated in this phase are sold. Over 13,900 holders have secured their positions at the current price of $0.03, just before the next planned price increase to $0.035—a 20% rise. This rapid token uptake illustrates strong market confidence and positions MUTM as one of the hottest altcoins for investors seeking meaningful returns ahead of the token’s full launch. Stablecoin Innovation & mtToken Staking Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a decentralized stablecoin designed to maintain a steady $1 value. This stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against collateral like ETH, and burned upon loan repayment or liquidation. Governance will actively adjust borrowing interest rates to keep the stablecoin price close to its peg, lowering rates if it trades above $1 and raising them if it dips below. This dynamic rate model works alongside natural arbitrage to maintain price stability. Meanwhile, mtTokens generated in lending pools can be staked in designated smart contracts, enabling holders to earn passive income through MUTM buybacks. This mechanism not only incentivizes long-term holding but also adds an extra layer of security and community engagement to the ecosystem. Roadmap Progress and Future Milestones Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has made significant strides since the presale launch. Most of Phase 1, “Introducing Mutuum Finance (MUTM),” is complete, including presale initiation, marketing campaigns, giveaway launches, external smart contract audits, token tracking listings, and implementation of an AI-powered helpdesk. Pending items include educational content on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s technology and forming a legal and compliance team. Looking ahead, Phase 2, titled “Building Mutuum Finance (MUTM),” will focus on core smart contract development, DApp front-end and back-end infrastructure setup, introduction of advanced features, and implementation of robust risk parameters. Both internal and external auditors will conduct regular code reviews to ensure security and efficiency. Additionally, Phase 2 will bring advanced analytics tools for improved platform insights.

2025-07-23 10:09:01+00:00,Bitcoin News Today: On‑Chain Metrics Hint at Next Wave of Selling Pressure,"The post Bitcoin News Today: On‑Chain Metrics Hint at Next Wave of Selling Pressure appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin is once again showing signs of entering a strong rally, but this time, the signals are coming from its on-chain data rather than just price action. Bitcoin’s hidden supply is waking up again, and it could mean something big for what’s next. Verified CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. recently highlighted fresh signs in Bitcoin’s % Supply Active chart that could tell us where this market is headed next. So, what’s happening? Bitcoin Supply Sharply Increased CryptoQuant’s verified on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. says the share of Bitcoin’s active supply in the past 180 days is starting to rise. When this number goes up, it means coins that were sitting still for months or even years are now moving again. This usually points to more selling or holders spreading out their coins as prices go higher.

A few months later, in December 2024, supply activity rose again to 18% when Bitcoin broke through the key $100,000 mark for the first time. Now, in June 2025, we see the same trend starting but with one big difference. Even though Bitcoin is steady around $100,000, the latest data shows supply activity has only gone up slightly, from negative levels to about +2.4% in the last 30 days.

Bitcoin Supply Sharply Increased CryptoQuant’s verified on-chain analyst Axel Adler Jr. says the share of Bitcoin’s active supply in the past 180 days is starting to rise.

Can young coins like Pi Network’s PI coin ride Bitcoin’s momentum? Or will their destiny hinge on internal developments and network milestones? Let me start with an overview of the current stats. With the global crypto market capitalization hovering at ~$3.93 trillion, and trading volumes nearing $193.74 billion despite a 10.95% decline, sentiment remains elevated. The Fear & Greed Index currently reads 70, indicating investor greed. Meanwhile, the Altcoin Season Index has risen to 56 out of 100, suggesting growing enthusiasm for non-Bitcoin assets. Where Does Pi Stand Today? Pi Coin is currently trading at $0.4631 after a daily decline of 4.69%, despite a 3.98% gain over the past week. Its market capitalization stands at $3.57 billion, while trading volume has dipped sharply to $118.49 million, down 37.73% over the past 24 hours. Over the last month, Pi has retreated by 9.18%, underlining that despite favorable macro conditions, Pi’s price movement may remain restrained without a clear fundamental catalyst from within the project itself. What Does BTC’s MVRV Ratio Have to Say? Bitcoin’s 365-day MVRV ratio currently stands at 23.4%. Historically, a ratio above 50% has often signaled overbought conditions, where investors tend to take profits. The current level, being in the moderate zone, suggests that Bitcoin still has room to climb and is not yet in euphoric territory. This offers a supportive backdrop for the thesis of BTC potentially targeting the $200,000 mark before the end of the cycle, particularly if macro tailwinds and institutional inflows persist. What About Pi Network’s On-Chain Health? For Pi, the most important metric to watch is the unlocked supply ratio. Out of ~7.4 billion tokens migrated to the mainnet, about 2.2 billion Pi are currently unlocked. This means that nearly 30% of the migrated supply is already liquid and subject to market forces. As more users complete KYC and unlock their holdings, and as Pi potentially lists on centralized exchanges, both upside potential and downside volatility could increase significantly.

2025-07-23 10:18:46+00:00,DeepSeek Says Altseason Is Here – These 3 Presales Could Be First to Run,"Bitcoin is back on corporate balance sheets. Altcoins are waking up. And DeepSeek’s sentiment models hint at a bullish undercurrent building fast. Trump Media’s $2B Bitcoin bet and Strategy’s latest 6,220 $BTC haul ($739M) are pumping fresh momentum into the market, just as ETF flows and rising altcoin treasuries start pulling dominance away from Bitcoin. DeepSeek’s AI signals, and the on-chain behavior backing them, suggest that early-stage buyers are circling high-upside plays again. With rotation into $ETH, $SOL, and top presale projects gaining steam, this month could set the tone for Q3. Saylor, Trump, and the Altcoin Rotation There’s real capital backing the bullish shift. Strategy’s latest 6,220 $BTC buy puts its total stack at 607,770 $BTC (bigger than most S&P 500 treasuries), now worth over $71 billion. That’s nearly 3% of Bitcoin’s entire supply held by one publicly traded company. What began as a bold treasury experiment now mirrors traditional cash management – except the asset is Bitcoin. Enter Trump Media with a surprise $2 billion $BTC purchase, part of a broader crypto treasury strategy that includes ETF ambitions and an upcoming utility token. Together, these moves mark a narrative pivot: Bitcoin isn’t just a hedge, it’s becoming a reserve asset for politically and financially aligned institutions. DeepSeek’s latest sentiment sweep confirms the shift. Its AI model flagged early signs of altseason, noting $ETH, $SOL, and $XRP as breakout leaders. $BTC dominance is slipping, ETH/BTC is climbing , and Ethereum treasuries are emerging as the next institutional playbook – just like $BTC was in 2020. The Altcoin Season Index on CoinMarketCap recently flipped above 50 for the first time since December. If $BTC consolidates and dominance continues to bleed, alts and low-caps could rip. When rotation hits, the best crypto presales gain a lot of attention. Here are three ones you’ll want on your radar this month: 1. Best Wallet ($BEST) – The Wallet Token Set to Dominate Web3 With over $14.1M already raised, $BEST is quickly becoming the go-to presale for anyone looking to front-run the next wave of retail onboarding. Best Wallet positions itself as the “MetaMask killer”, and it’s not just talk. The app integrates presale discovery, staking, and iGaming rewards into a sleek interface secured by Fireblocks’ battle-tested MPC technology . Holding the $BEST token unlocks reduced gas fees, early access to new projects, and boosted APYs – currently offering 96% staking rewards. As ETH flows toward Layer-2s and the best altcoins gain steam, Best Wallet could become the default gateway for exploring that ecosystem safely. Its Upcoming Tokens feature already lets users access curated presales directly from the wallet, eliminating scam links and fake sites. At $0.025375, the token still sits in a sweet spot for early entry, especially if presales keep outperforming the majors this cycle. Check out our Best Wallet Token price prediction. 2. Snorter Bot ($SNORT) – Meme Utility Built for Telegram Traders If you’re active in meme coin circles, you already know Telegram bots are the new trading frontier. Snorter Bot ($SNORT) taps straight into that momentum, delivering a lightning-fast, meme-branded trading suite that runs natively inside Telegram. With $1.99 million raised so far, $SNORT gives holders access to advanced tools like instant launch sniping, copy trading, and MEV protection – all executed through simple chat commands. No browser. No extensions. Just fast, secure trades from your favorite degen group chat. It supports Solana at launch, with Ethereum and BNB Chain rolling out next. That multi-chain roadmap gives Snorter the reach it needs to scale alongside the best meme coins meta, and it’s already doing it with real utility. The token is priced at $0.0991, and staking rewards hit 179%. That’s big, but it makes sense: you’re not just buying into a meme; you’re getting a premium trading stack that actually works. Learn how to buy Snorter in our step-by-step guide. 3. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) – The AI Protocol With Real Infrastructure While most “AI coins” are just chatbots with logos, Lightchain AI ($LCAI) actually builds the plumbing. It’s already raised $21.8 million+, and the current bonus round gives latecomers one more shot at its presale price of $0.007125. At its core is a fully functional AI Virtual Machine and a novel Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism – where nodes get rewarded for running real AI workloads like model training and inference. That means the network doesn’t just secure itself, it gets smarter as it grows. The protocol also includes a Meme Launchpad, giving it speculative legs, but the tech is what sets it apart. Governance is on-chain, utility is already live, and developers are actively building around its infrastructure.It’s a legit infrastructure play in a sector that’s mostly vaporware.

2025-07-23 10:20:00+00:00,To Bitcoin Or Not To Bitcoin? A Corporate Cash Question!,"Summary In this post, I will bring together two disparate and very different topics that I have written about in the past. The first is the role that cash holdings play in a business, an extension of the dividend policy question, with an examination of why businesses often should not pay out what they have available to shareholders. The second is bitcoin, which can be viewed as either a currency or a collectible, and in a series of posts, I argued that bitcoin can only be priced, not valued, making debates about whether to buy or not to buy entirely a function of perception. In this post, I will bring together two disparate and very different topics that I have written about in the past. The first is the role that cash holdings play in a business , an extension of the dividend policy question, with an examination of why businesses often should not pay out what they have available to shareholders. In my classes and writing on corporate finance, I look at the motives for businesses retaining cash, as well as how much cash is too much cash. The second is bitcoin , which can be viewed as either a currency or a collectible, and in a series of posts, I argued that bitcoin can only be priced, not valued, making debates about whether to buy or not to buy entirely a function of perception. In fact, I have steered away from saying much about bitcoin in recent years, though I did mention it in my post on alternative investments as a collectible (like gold) that can be added to the choice mix. While there may be little that seemingly connects the two topics (cash and bitcoin), I was drawn to write this post because of a debate that seems to be heating up on whether companies should put some or a large portion of their cash balances into bitcoin, with the success of MicroStrategy, a high-profile beneficiary of this action, driving some of this push. I believe that it is a terrible idea for most companies, and before Bitcoin believers get riled up, my reasoning has absolutely nothing to do with what I think of bitcoin as an investment and more to do with how little I trust corporate managers to time trades right. That said, I do see a small subset of companies, where the holding bitcoin strategy makes sense, as long as there are guardrails on disclosure and governance. Cash in a Going Concern In a world where businesses can raise capital (equity or debt) at fair prices and in a timely manner, there is little need to hold cash, but that is not the world we live in. For a variety of reasons, some internal and some external, companies are often unable or unwilling to raise capital from markets, and with that constraint in place, it is logical to hold cash to meet unforeseen needs. In this section, I will start by laying out the role that cash holdings play in any business, and examine how much cash is held by companies, broken down by groupings (regional, size, industry). A Financial Balance Sheet To understand the place of cash in a business, I will start with a financial balance sheet, a structure for breaking down a business, public or private: On the asset side of the balance sheet, you start with the operating business or businesses that a company is in, with a bifurcation of value into value from investments already made (assets-in-place) and value from investments that the company expects to make in the future (growth assets). The second asset grouping, non-operating assets, includes a range of investments that a company may make, sometimes to augment its core businesses (strategic investments), and sometimes as side investments, and thus include minority holdings in other companies (cross holdings) and even investments in financial assets. Sometimes, as is the case with family group companies, these cross holdings may be a reflection of the company''s history as part of the group, with investments in other group companies for either capital or corporate control reasons. The third grouping is for cash and marketable securities, and this is meant specifically for investments that share two common characteristics - they are riskless or close to riskless insofar as holding their value over time and they are liquid in the sense that they can be converted to cash quickly and with no penalty. For most companies, this has meant investing cash in short-term bonds or bills, issued by either governments (assuming that they have little default risk) or by large, safe companies (in the form of commercial paper issued by highly rated firms). Note that there are two sources of capital for any business, debt or equity, and in assessing how levered a firm is, investors look at the proportion of the capital that comes from each: Debt to Equity = Debt/ Equity Debt to Capital = Debt/ (Debt + Equity) In fact, there are many analysts and investors who estimate these debt ratios, using net debt, where they net the cash holdings of a company against the debt, with the rationale, merited or not, that cash can be used to pay down debt.

In this post, I will bring together two disparate and very different topics that I have written about in the past. The first is the role that cash holdings play in a business , an extension of the dividend policy question, with an examination of why businesses often should not pay out what they have available to shareholders. In my classes and writing on corporate finance, I look at the motives for businesses retaining cash, as well as how much cash is too much cash. The second is bitcoin , which can be viewed as either a currency or a collectible, and in a series of posts, I argued that bitcoin can only be priced, not valued, making debates about whether to buy or not to buy entirely a function of perception. In fact, I have steered away from saying much about bitcoin in recent years, though I did mention it in my post on alternative investments as a collectible (like gold) that can be added to the choice mix. While there may be little that seemingly connects the two topics (cash and bitcoin), I was drawn to write this post because of a debate that seems to be heating up on whether companies should put some or a large portion of their cash balances into bitcoin, with the success of MicroStrategy, a high-profile beneficiary of this action, driving some of this push. I believe that it is a terrible idea for most companies, and before Bitcoin believers get riled up, my reasoning has absolutely nothing to do with what I think of bitcoin as an investment and more to do with how little I trust corporate managers to time trades right. That said, I do see a small subset of companies, where the holding bitcoin strategy makes sense, as long as there are guardrails on disclosure and governance. Cash in a Going Concern In a world where businesses can raise capital (equity or debt) at fair prices and in a timely manner, there is little need to hold cash, but that is not the world we live in. For a variety of reasons, some internal and some external, companies are often unable or unwilling to raise capital from markets, and with that constraint in place, it is logical to hold cash to meet unforeseen needs. In this section, I will start by laying out the role that cash holdings play in any business, and examine how much cash is held by companies, broken down by groupings (regional, size, industry). A Financial Balance Sheet To understand the place of cash in a business, I will start with a financial balance sheet, a structure for breaking down a business, public or private: On the asset side of the balance sheet, you start with the operating business or businesses that a company is in, with a bifurcation of value into value from investments already made (assets-in-place) and value from investments that the company expects to make in the future (growth assets). The second asset grouping, non-operating assets, includes a range of investments that a company may make, sometimes to augment its core businesses (strategic investments), and sometimes as side investments, and thus include minority holdings in other companies (cross holdings) and even investments in financial assets. Sometimes, as is the case with family group companies, these cross holdings may be a reflection of the company''s history as part of the group, with investments in other group companies for either capital or corporate control reasons. The third grouping is for cash and marketable securities, and this is meant specifically for investments that share two common characteristics - they are riskless or close to riskless insofar as holding their value over time and they are liquid in the sense that they can be converted to cash quickly and with no penalty. For most companies, this has meant investing cash in short-term bonds or bills, issued by either governments (assuming that they have little default risk) or by large, safe companies (in the form of commercial paper issued by highly rated firms). Note that there are two sources of capital for any business, debt or equity, and in assessing how levered a firm is, investors look at the proportion of the capital that comes from each: Debt to Equity = Debt/ Equity Debt to Capital = Debt/ (Debt + Equity) In fact, there are many analysts and investors who estimate these debt ratios, using net debt, where they net the cash holdings of a company against the debt, with the rationale, merited or not, that cash can be used to pay down debt.

The latest data revealed that Binance’s BTC reserves have been on a steady decline since September 2024, from approximately 631,000 BTC to 574,000 BTC, even as the crypto exchange’s unrealized gains on these holdings continue to climb. Bitcoin Reserves Down, Profits Up The reserves, which are primarily used to support Binance’s operational liquidity and BNB Chain operations, have benefited from Bitcoin’s latest price rally. It has pushed up the value of its remaining holdings despite the overall decline in reserve volume. Binance also holds about 16,000 BTC in custodial wallets to back its BTCB token, which ensures sufficient liquidity for tokenized Bitcoin on the BNB Chain. Tracking Binance’s BTC reserves provides insight into long-term market sentiment, as declining reserves often indicate that investors are withdrawing Bitcoin from exchanges. CryptoQuant explained that this suggests stronger conviction among holders. The simultaneous decrease in reserves and increase in unrealized profits highlights the impact of Bitcoin’s price appreciation on Binance’s balance sheet. Crypto Exchanges See Volume Spike Exchange activity across the market accelerated sharply as BTC surged to a new all-time high last week. CryptoQuant noted that the spot trading volumes on centralized platforms rebounded, while futures turnover and aggregate open interest climbed. This was indicative of an influx of fresh capital into derivatives markets amid the rally. Binance, for one, recorded the largest single-day increase in spot trading volume both on the day before and the day after Bitcoin hit its new high. The exchange captured a 52% market share on July 18. Other platforms, including Crypto.com, Coinbase, Bybit, and OKX, also registered high spot trading activity during the period. At the same time, Binance saw the highest growth in futures open interest as traders and investors opened long positions anticipating further gains. Bybit and Gate.io similarly recorded significant increases in their open interest. Going forward, experts believe that Bitcoin is entering a delicate phase as long-term holders begin selling for the first time since early 2024. This profit-taking increases the likelihood of near-term volatility. ETFs and institutional buyers are absorbing the distributed supply, but the sustainability of this demand will determine Bitcoin’s next move.

2025-07-23 10:40:23+00:00,Bitcoin Holdings Soar: Hilbert Group’s Strategic $15.8M Deal with LDA Capital,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Holdings Soar: Hilbert Group’s Strategic $15.8M Deal with LDA Capital In the dynamic world of digital assets, strategic moves by major players often signal broader market trends. Recently, the digital asset manager Hilbert Group made headlines with a significant financing agreement aimed at bolstering its Bitcoin holdings . This development isn’t just a win for Hilbert Group; it offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolving landscape of institutional cryptocurrency adoption and treasury management. It underscores a growing confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset, attracting substantial investment from global financial powerhouses. What is Hilbert Group’s Strategic Move to Boost Bitcoin Holdings ? Digital asset manager Hilbert Group, a prominent player in the cryptocurrency space, has successfully inked a SEK 150 million (approximately $15.8 million) structured financing agreement with LDA Capital, a global investment firm. This isn’t just a simple loan; it’s a sophisticated, long-term partnership designed to give Hilbert Group the flexibility it needs to execute its ambitious Bitcoin holdings treasury strategy. The news, initially shared by @btcNLNico on X, quickly resonated across the crypto community, highlighting the increasing sophistication of capital allocation in the digital asset sector. The core of this agreement is a 36-month, ATM (At-the-Market)-style facility. This unique structure allows Hilbert Group to draw capital flexibly over time, rather than receiving a lump sum upfront. Why is this significant for their Bitcoin holdings ? It means they can strategically acquire more BTC based on market conditions, liquidity needs, and their long-term investment outlook, without the pressure of deploying a large amount of capital all at once. This adaptability is crucial in the often-volatile crypto market, enabling a more measured and potentially more profitable accumulation strategy. Why are Firms Like Hilbert Group Increasing Their Bitcoin Holdings ? The decision by Hilbert Group to significantly expand its Bitcoin holdings reflects a broader, accelerating trend among corporations and institutional investors. Bitcoin, once viewed with skepticism, is increasingly being recognized as a legitimate, valuable asset for corporate treasuries. But what’s driving this shift? Inflation Hedge: In an era of quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is seen by many as a robust hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Its capped supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently scarce, similar to digital gold. Store of Value: As a decentralized and censorship-resistant asset, Bitcoin offers a unique store of value proposition, independent of traditional financial systems and government policies. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can provide diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds, potentially enhancing overall portfolio returns and reducing correlation risk. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite its volatility, many institutions believe in Bitcoin’s long-term growth trajectory, driven by increasing adoption, technological advancements, and its network effect. Signaling Confidence: Publicly increasing Bitcoin holdings can also signal a forward-thinking and innovative approach to investors, aligning with the growing digital economy. Companies like MicroStrategy have pioneered this strategy, accumulating vast amounts of Bitcoin and demonstrating its viability as a primary treasury asset. Hilbert Group’s move reinforces this narrative, indicating that more firms are moving beyond mere speculation to integrate Bitcoin into their core financial strategies. The Mechanics of the ATM-Style Facility: How Does it Impact Bitcoin Holdings ? Understanding the ‘ATM-style facility’ is key to appreciating the sophistication of Hilbert Group’s financing deal. ‘ATM’ stands for ‘At-the-Market,’ and it’s a type of equity offering where a company can sell new shares of stock directly into the secondary market at prevailing market prices over a period of time. In this case, it’s adapted for financing a treasury strategy. Here’s how it typically works and why it’s beneficial for managing Bitcoin holdings : Flexible Capital Access: Instead of receiving a fixed amount of capital all at once, Hilbert Group can ‘draw down’ funds from LDA Capital as needed over the 36-month period. This means they only take capital when they have a clear use case or see opportune moments to purchase Bitcoin. Market Timing Advantages: This flexibility allows Hilbert Group to time its Bitcoin purchases more effectively. If the BTC price dips, they can draw capital to buy at a lower cost basis. If the price is high, they can pause, avoiding overpaying. This is crucial for optimizing their Bitcoin holdings . Reduced Market Impact: Unlike a large, single capital infusion that might require immediate, large-scale asset purchases (potentially moving the market), an ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-holdings-hilbert-deal/,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TREASURY|TRADING,Crypto News|BITCOIN|Crypto Investment|Digital Assets|Hilbert Group|LDA capital,BTC,"Bitcoin Holdings Soar: Hilbert Group’s Strategic $15.8M Deal with LDA Capital.

2025-07-23 10:44:44+00:00,ARKB May Provide An Extra Layer Of Security With Bitcoin Cold Storage,"Summary ARKB provides investors with full exposure to Bitcoin with the additional feature of Bitcoin cold storage. Bitcoin cold storage can provide an extra layer of security, keeping bitcoin holdings offline in a secured vault. Bitcoin may be supported by new legislation designed to support security and privacy for cryptocurrency. The ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ) is a co-managed fund between Ark Investment Management and 21Shares, designed to provide investors with exposure to bitcoin. ARKB takes a differentiated approach to its investment strategy. Similar to the CoinShares Bitcoin ETF ( BRRR ), ARKB purchases and stores bitcoin in cold storage through a trusted custodian, potentially offering greater protection when compared to traditional brokerage accounts. Bitcoin cold storage is essentially the act of keeping the bitcoin in an offline environment, reducing the risk of being the victim of hacking and theft. Despite the assets being held in an offline environment, ARKB trades in tandem with bitcoin, offering investors indirect exposure to a more secured bitcoin investment strategy. TradingView As of July 21, 2025, ARKB held 50,251 bitcoins valued at $5.9b. Corporate Reports This compares to the fund''s assets under management of $5.94b, suggesting that shares may be trading at a slight premium to assets. Seeking Alpha Compared to peer bitcoin ETFs, ARKB has a relatively low management fee of 21 bps, slightly below WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund ETF ( BTCW ), Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF ( BTCO ), and iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), each charging 25bps. Compared to its closest peer, BRRR, ARKB provides substantially more liquidity with $5.94b in assets under management and an average of 2.5mm shares trading hands daily. IBIT exhibits the most volumes traded, with 47mm shares trading hands daily with $86b in assets under management. Despite the substantial trading depth, I do not believe these differences will impact overall liquidity or spreads. Given that the core differentiator between ARKB and peer bitcoin ETFs is that ARKB stores its bitcoin holdings offline, I believe this factor should be left to the investor in determining which bitcoin ETF suits them best. Performance across the bitcoin ETFs is relatively narrow, with a few basis point differences. Seeking Alpha Performance may remain strong for bitcoin given the strong capital inflows across bitcoin ETFs . According to Deutsche Bank, US-listed bitcoin ETFs have collectively gained $35b in inflows year-to-date. Despite the notion that bitcoin can offer investors an alternative investment strategy, bitcoin performance is relatively correlated to the broader market. I suspect that this phenomenon is the result of bitcoin ETFs being included in asset allocation in wealth management, making bitcoin a more commercially available asset that can be invested in, rebalanced, and sold for cash raises. Given these features, I do not believe bitcoin can provide investors with differentiated returns or act as a hedge against the US dollar or the broader market. TradingView On the regulatory front, the decentralized appeal of bitcoin may be shifting with the CLARITY Act , which will give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] a central role in regulating digital commodities and related intermediaries. The GENIUS Act , or Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, was passed and signed into law on July 18, 2025, establishing a framework to accelerate the development of stablecoins. This act could potentially support bitcoin through a less regulated market for stablecoins. Risks Related to ARKB Storing bitcoin in cold storage does come with certain risks. Because the assets are held offline, the assets will be held on a physical device such as a disconnected server or a number of other devices designed to store bitcoin. The bitcoin custodian for ARKB uses a multi-layer security protocol, meaning that the private keys, the cryptographic component that allows users to access bitcoin, are stored offline on hardware that has never been connected to the Internet in a cold storage vault. The only time the hardware will be taken out of the vault is to maintain the trading balance through Coinbase ( COIN ) or trading counterparty. Despite the secured protocol, there are a number of risks that may arise from maintaining a physical bitcoin wallet. Because these devices cannot be backed up, funds may not be recovered if the custodian were to lose access to the hardware wallet or if the wallet were to suffer physical damage or theft. This single point of failure can potentially increase the risk of holding bitcoin in cold storage, leading to a loss of assets in the event of theft or damage. Because hardware devices are disconnected from the Internet, regular updates to software may not be feasible, potentially adding certain risks to hardware failure or cybersecurity threats when connected to engage in transactions. Final Thoughts ARKB ca",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803359-arkb-may-provide-an-extra-layer-of-security-with-bitcoin-cold-storage?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,BRRR|IBIT|ARKB,BTC,"ARKB May Provide An Extra Layer Of Security With Bitcoin Cold Storage.

Performance across the bitcoin ETFs is relatively narrow, with a few basis point differences. Seeking Alpha Performance may remain strong for bitcoin given the strong capital inflows across bitcoin ETFs . According to Deutsche Bank, US-listed bitcoin ETFs have collectively gained $35b in inflows year-to-date. Despite the notion that bitcoin can offer investors an alternative investment strategy, bitcoin performance is relatively correlated to the broader market. I suspect that this phenomenon is the result of bitcoin ETFs being included in asset allocation in wealth management, making bitcoin a more commercially available asset that can be invested in, rebalanced, and sold for cash raises. Given these features, I do not believe bitcoin can provide investors with differentiated returns or act as a hedge against the US dollar or the broader market. TradingView On the regulatory front, the decentralized appeal of bitcoin may be shifting with the CLARITY Act , which will give the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] a central role in regulating digital commodities and related intermediaries. The GENIUS Act , or Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, was passed and signed into law on July 18, 2025, establishing a framework to accelerate the development of stablecoins. This act could potentially support bitcoin through a less regulated market for stablecoins. Risks Related to ARKB Storing bitcoin in cold storage does come with certain risks. Because the assets are held offline, the assets will be held on a physical device such as a disconnected server or a number of other devices designed to store bitcoin. The bitcoin custodian for ARKB uses a multi-layer security protocol, meaning that the private keys, the cryptographic component that allows users to access bitcoin, are stored offline on hardware that has never been connected to the Internet in a cold storage vault. The only time the hardware will be taken out of the vault is to maintain the trading balance through Coinbase ( COIN ) or trading counterparty. Despite the secured protocol, there are a number of risks that may arise from maintaining a physical bitcoin wallet. Because these devices cannot be backed up, funds may not be recovered if the custodian were to lose access to the hardware wallet or if the wallet were to suffer physical damage or theft. This single point of failure can potentially increase the risk of holding bitcoin in cold storage, leading to a loss of assets in the event of theft or damage. Because hardware devices are disconnected from the Internet, regular updates to software may not be feasible, potentially adding certain risks to hardware failure or cybersecurity threats when connected to engage in transactions.

2025-07-23 10:45:23+00:00,Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: Unveiling a Crucial Local Bottom Signal,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Short-Term Holders: Unveiling a Crucial Local Bottom Signal In the often unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, market signals are highly sought after. Every dip, every surge, prompts a flurry of analysis as investors try to decipher the next move. Recently, a fascinating insight has emerged from CryptoQuant, suggesting that the behavior of Bitcoin short-term holders might be providing a crucial clue about an impending local bottom for BTC. Could this be the signal many have been waiting for? Let’s dive deep into what this means for the market and your investment strategy. Understanding Bitcoin Short-Term Holders (STHs): Who Are They? Before we dissect the signal, it’s important to understand who we’re talking about. In the crypto space, investors are often categorized by how long they hold their assets: Long-Term Holders (LTHs): These are individuals or entities who typically hold their Bitcoin for more than 155 days. They are often seen as conviction investors, less likely to be swayed by short-term price fluctuations. Their movements usually indicate broader market sentiment or macro trends. Short-Term Holders (STHs): Conversely, Bitcoin short-term holders are those who have held their BTC for less than 155 days. These investors are generally more reactive to immediate price movements. They might be traders looking for quick gains, or newer entrants to the market who are less experienced with volatility. Their buying and selling patterns can offer significant insights into immediate market sentiment and potential turning points. The behavior of STHs is particularly interesting because their decisions are often driven by profit-taking or fear of loss in the near term. When a significant portion of these holders starts moving their coins, it can indicate a shift in short-term market dynamics. The CryptoQuant Insight: What Does the Binance Inflow Ratio Tell Us? The recent analysis by CryptoQuant contributor Amr Taha brought attention to a specific metric: the Binance inflow ratio of Bitcoin short-term holders . This metric measures the proportion of Bitcoin being deposited onto the Binance exchange by STHs relative to the total inflows. Here’s why this matters: Binance Inflow Ratio: This ratio tracks how much BTC is being sent to Binance, a major exchange, specifically from wallets identified as belonging to STHs. An increase in this ratio suggests that a higher percentage of incoming Bitcoin on Binance originates from these short-term investors. The 0.4 Threshold: Amr Taha highlighted that this ratio recently exceeded 0.4. Historically, this particular level has been associated with local bottoms for BTC. This means that in previous instances where STHs were depositing a significant amount of Bitcoin to Binance (above 40% of total inflows), the market often found a temporary floor shortly thereafter. Why Deposits? STHs typically deposit Bitcoin to exchanges for one primary reason: to sell. Whether they are taking profits after a price pump or cutting losses during a dip, the act of moving funds to an exchange usually precedes a transaction. The core idea here is that if a large number of Bitcoin short-term holders are sending their coins to exchanges, likely to realize profits, it indicates that a significant amount of supply is hitting the market. If the market can absorb this selling pressure without a drastic price collapse, it suggests underlying demand is strong enough to establish a bottom. Why Would STHs Taking Profits Signal a Local Bottom? This might seem counterintuitive at first glance. If people are selling, shouldn’t the price go down? While selling pressure naturally pushes prices lower, the context of STH profit-taking at a specific ratio offers a nuanced perspective: Supply Exhaustion: When a significant number of STHs decide to take profits, it can signal that the short-term profit potential has been largely realized by this group. Once these immediate sellers have exited, the selling pressure from this cohort might temporarily exhaust itself. Absorption by Strong Hands: If the market manages to hold its ground or even bounce after a wave of STH profit-taking, it implies that stronger hands (often long-term holders or new institutional capital) are stepping in to buy up the available supply. This absorption creates a demand floor. Psychological Reset: A period of STH profit-taking can act as a psychological reset for the market. It clears out some of the speculative froth and allows for a more stable base to form before the next upward movement. It’s like a cleansing event that removes weaker hands. Therefore, the increase in Binance inflows from Bitcoin short-term holders , particularly above the 0.4 threshold, isn’t just about selling; it’s about the market’s ability to absorb that selling and potentially turn it into a foundation for recovery.

After a shaky start to the year, ETH has posted an impressive recovery—gaining over 150% since April. Crypto analyst VirtualBacon now believes Ethereum is in the early stages of a macro bull run, driven by bullish technical signals, rising ETF inflows, and Ethereum’s dominance in tokenization and stablecoins. Ethereum Price Analysis Analyst highlights Ethereum’s breakout above the 20-week SMA ($2,345.85) and 50-week SMA ($2,679.45)—a strong bullish signal. He notes that past bull runs began under similar conditions, with: Higher lows forming The 50-week SMA acting as support The 20-week SMA curling upward He also points to the $2,600–$2,900 range as a strong support zone for buyers. ETH Is Outperforming Bitcoin In the past month, ETH has gained 62.2%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 15.9%. VirtualBacon also notes the ETH/BTC ratio has broken a 3-year downtrend, signaling that Ethereum may continue to lead the current rally. “As long as ETH/BTC stays above 0.022, Ethereum remains in control,” he says. Ethereum ETF Inflows Point to Institutional Demand Institutional interest is growing fast. Ethereum holdings by companies have jumped from $23 million to $6.6 billion in just three months. According to Coinglass, the Ethereum spot ETF market has seen consistent daily inflows since July 9, including a record $726.6 million on July 16 and $533.8 million just yesterday. While the BTC ETF market cap stands at $153.32 billion, ETH’s ETF market is growing fast at $18.40 billion. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Top 10 Altcoins Will See 10x Surge Once Ethereum Breaks Its All-Time High , Ethereum Leads in Stablecoins and Tokenization Analyst also points to Ethereum’s leadership in real-world blockchain use cases: 54% of $247B stablecoins are issued on Ethereum 70% of RWA tokenization protocols run on Ethereum or its Layer 2s This includes leading platforms like MakerDAO and Centrifuge, giving Ethereum a clear edge in institutional adoption.

On Tuesday, the agency’s Division of Trading and Markets granted accelerated approval for Bitwise’s plan to convert its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) into an ETF, allowing Bitwise to request an early effective registration date. However, on the same day, SEC assistant secretary Sherry Haywood issued a letter stating the “order is stayed until the Commission orders otherwise,” indicating the SEC will review the delegated approval internally. Approval and Immediate Suspension Create Uncertainty Bitwise’s fund, which offers diversified exposure to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, filed for conversion to an ETF in November, aiming to transition its index fund into a structure that could attract broader investor participation. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that the SEC acted sooner than expected, as a decision was originally due next week, but clarified that the approval had been stayed by “one or multiple commissioners,” preventing immediate conversion. Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, described the situation as “bizarre,” drawing parallels to the Grayscale Digital Large Cap ETF, which faced a similar pause after its approval on July 1. Speculation Grows Around SEC Motives The pause has fueled speculation within the industry regarding the SEC’s intentions . Scott Johnsson of Van Buren Capital speculated that the approval was granted under delegated authority to preempt potential disruptions from Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, the sole Democrat on the panel, or alternatively, to navigate around the statutory 240-day approval timeline. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas suggested the SEC may be delaying conversions while it finalizes generic listing standards for crypto ETFs, anticipating a rollout before October deadlines. The SEC has recently been engaging with fund managers, stock exchanges, and internal teams to streamline ETF approval processes for crypto vehicles, including potentially automating parts of the application process to bypass 19b-4 filings. Additionally, the SEC extended its review timeline on in-kind redemption structures for Bitwise’s Bitcoin and Ether spot ETFs on July 17, adding to the regulatory complexity surrounding crypto ETF approvals.

2025-07-23 11:00:26+00:00,‘Not A Threat’: Wester Union To Explore Stablecoin Integration For Cross-Border Payments,"Western Union has joined the stablecoin race following the end of the historic “Crypto Week” and the recent passage of key legislation. The company is reportedly set to tap into digital assets for faster cross-border payments. Western Union Eyes ‘Opportunity To Innovate’ On Monday, Western Union CEO Devin McGranahan said that the company is exploring a path to integrate stablecoins into its services worldwide as interest in the sector continues to grow. In an interview with Bloomberg, McGranahan affirmed that stablecoins aren’t a threat to the company, but “one more opportunity to innovate,” adding that the sector offers three “real” opportunities for Western Union and its customers. According to the CEO, integrating these assets offers a path for faster cross-border payments. It also provides an opportunity for conversion between fiat currencies and stablecoins, particularly in countries where local currency conversions are harder. Additionally, the company could offer stablecoins as a store of value to their customer worldwide. McGranahan detailed that the company is already innovating new settlement processes to “move money quicker and to more easily convert into local currency” in different places, including South America and Africa. Moreover, Western Union is exploring partnerships with infrastructure companies to enable buying and selling these digital assets through their platform and how it could offer stablecoin products in its digital wallets to its customers: We are also exploring other partnerships with people who want on-ramps and off-ramps in different parts of the world and how we could enable Western Union’s funds in and funds out to enable people to purchase and sell Stablecoins. More Companies Prepare Stablecoin Integration McGranahan’s remarks come just days after US President Donald Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law last Friday. The legislation is set to establish a clear regulatory framework for stablecoins, allowing tokens like USDT and USDC to fall under the Federal Reserve rules and enable the sector’s growth in the US. Standard Chartered Bank has estimated that the stablecoin market, valued at $268 billion, could expand to $2 trillion by 2028. Similarly, White House Crypto Czar David Sacks forecasted that the sector could reach a $3 trillion valuation in the coming years once legislation was passed. MARA CEO Fred Thiel considers that the US is taking a leadership position globally following the GENIUS Act’s passage, adding that it will be “very helpful for providing trust” to the sector and allowing the market to “move much freer.” Notably, several major US banks, including Bank of America (BofA) and Citibank, are also exploring the sector amid the US regulatory shift. BofA’s CEO, Brian Moynihan, recently confirmed the bank is developing its stablecoin.

Explains What He Expects for the Price After That!","Following a rally in recent weeks, leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) broke a new record, surpassing $123,000. Following a subsequent correction, BTC continues to consolidate below $120,000. While Bitcoin''s rise is expected to continue, the price is expected to reach 200,000-250,000 dollars by the end of the year. However, the Glassnode analyst said that Bitcoin is unlikely to reach $200,000 this year. Speaking to the YouTube channel Less Noise More Signal, Glassnode chief analyst James Check stated that the buying pressure and trading volume in Bitcoin are insufficient, and that it is unlikely that the price will reach $200,000 in 2025. “Bitcoin is unlikely to reach $200,000 this year. This is because there is not enough buying pressure and trading volume remains low.” The analyst also noted that Bitcoin still has many obstacles to overcome, warning that a major drop could occur if the price rises without proper support. “There are many thresholds ahead of us, such as $130,000 and $140,000. Without strong and stable support, any rapid price increase could result in an equally sharp decline.” The analyst also stated that he will not take long-term leveraged positions until trading volume increases, adding, “I will not take risks until market stability is achieved.” Finally, emphasizing that Bitcoin will eventually surpass $200,000, the analyst said, “I am confident that Bitcoin will definitely surpass $200,000 in the next five years.

2025-07-23 11:15:09+00:00,South Korea FSS pushes for asset managers to limit crypto ETF exposure,"The Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) of South Korea has given new orders to local asset managers to limit their exposure to crypto-related firms in their exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The directive refers to larger U.S. crypto companies, such as Coinbase (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR), which are prominently included in several local ETF portfolios. The asset managers have been advised not to place much emphasis on crypto-themed stocks in ETF structure based on some of the guidelines that have been reviewed by local firms. Others, including Korea Investment Management ACE US Stock Bestseller ETF, already hold more than 14% in Coinbase . The KoACT US Nasdaq Growth Company Active ETF includes 13.4% of Coinbase and 13.4% of Strategy. Although the retail phenomenon of crypto investments is increasingly popular in South Korea , the FSS has doubled down on its 2017 position, which prohibits direct holdings, investments, or use of cryptocurrencies as collateral by financial organizations. An FSS official reiterated that although the global opinion would seem to be trending towards the use of digital assets, South Korea needs to follow the currently available guidelines until a wider legal framework is adopted. The announcement was made amid increased tension between regulatory conservatism and the rapidly growing crypto sector in the country. Crypto demand grows as regulators hold back The FSS crackdown comes after South Korea registered a rise in crypto-related investments. More than 18 million citizens trade cryptocurrencies, and several ETFs have become more heavily weighted with digital asset companies listed overseas. Such trends expose the gap between investor demands and regulatory policy. The South Korean ETF market now includes more than 1,000 listed products, whereas the FSS is still worried about the risk of overexposure to crypto stocks. The agency advice identifies ETFs that allocate over 10% of their funds in firms dealing with virtual assets, especially those that use U.S. listings. Market players say that focusing on domestic ETFs is not a level playing field. Investors can still indirectly get exposure to crypto through the U.S.-based ETFs, free from similar restrictions. Some critics argue that local money is being unfairly restricted, hitting competitiveness and damaging passive investment techniques. Conflicting signals as government pursues crypto-friendly measures The FSS directive is opposed to the recent events that seemed promising to the crypto world. The Ministry of SMEs and Startups of South Korea recently suggested lifting controls that did not allow crypto firms to obtain tax incentives and governmental funding. The initiative will identify digital asset companies as venture enterprises. Regulatory interest also shifted to stablecoins , with many South Korean banks in exploratory mode. Others registered trademarks on potential stablecoin products, with the Bank of Korea revealing plans for a consortium of banks to issue a won-pegged stablecoin by 2026. In addition, Parataxis Holdings recently announced that it has established a presence in South Korea and is the first Bitcoin treasury company through its acquisition of biotech company Bridge Biotherapeutics.

Analyst Predicts $13 in 6 Weeks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is on the move ! In the last 30 days, with a significant rise of 70.9%, XRP has outperformed almost all top cryptos, including the top two cryptos, Bitcoin (15.9%) and Ethereum (62.2%). In the last seven days alone, it has surged by over 16.7%. On July 16, the XRP price broke above the $3 mark for the first time in four months. At one point, on July 18, it touched a yearly peak of $3.6615. Since July 16 alone, the XRP market has jumped 18.17% to $3.4416. Tony “ The Bull” Severino , a respected market analyst, predicts that XRP could hit $13 within the next six weeks. Possible? Why’s this Optimistic about XRP? Severino’s prediction is not pulled from thin air. He points to at least three strong technical indications. Firstly, he highlights that XRP recently broke out of a massive, long-term pattern (that is, a seven-year Symmetrical Triangle pattern), signalling significant upward momentum. Secondly, he points out that a smaller, more recent triangle (that is, a six-month Bull Pennant pattern), also saw a breakout, adding to the bullish signs. Thirdly, as per his Elliot Wave analysis, XRP is right now in the “Wave 5” of its bullish cycle. He argues that Wave 4 saw XRP dip from $3.4 in January 2025 to $1.96 in June 2025. He claims that Wave 5 would push the XRP price significantly higher. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Trader Reveals 14x Gains, Predicts $5 as Next Stop , The Path to $13 for XRP If things evolve as predicted by Severino, the XRP market would hit the $13 market within the next six weeks. His six-week timeline is actually based on XRP’s historic 2017 bull run, where the cryptocurrency peaked six weeks after a similar pattern breakout. What Comes After the $13 XRP Peak? While the immediate future looks bright, Severiono warns that, after potentially hitting $13, XRP might experience a major market correction, possibly forming an ABC corrective pattern as per Elliott Wave Theory. In conclusion, Severino’s analysis paints an exceptionally bullish picture for XRP in the short term, supported by strong technical breakouts and Elliott Wave patterns. However, he also reminds investors that even strong rallies are often followed by corrections. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Analyst Predicts $13 in 6 Weeks. The post XRP Set to Skyrocket? Analyst Predicts $13 in 6 Weeks appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is on the move ! In the last 30 days, with a significant rise of 70.9%, XRP has outperformed almost all top cryptos, including the top two cryptos, Bitcoin (15.9%) and Ethereum (62.2%). In the last seven days alone, it has surged by over 16.7%. On July 16, the XRP price broke above the $3 mark for the first time in four months. At one point, on July 18, it touched a yearly peak of $3.6615. Since July 16 alone, the XRP market has jumped 18.17% to $3.4416. Tony “ The Bull” Severino , a respected market analyst, predicts that XRP could hit $13 within the next six weeks. Possible? Why’s this Optimistic about XRP? Severino’s prediction is not pulled from thin air. He points to at least three strong technical indications. Firstly, he highlights that XRP recently broke out of a massive, long-term pattern (that is, a seven-year Symmetrical Triangle pattern), signalling significant upward momentum. Secondly, he points out that a smaller, more recent triangle (that is, a six-month Bull Pennant pattern), also saw a breakout, adding to the bullish signs. Thirdly, as per his Elliot Wave analysis, XRP is right now in the “Wave 5” of its bullish cycle. He argues that Wave 4 saw XRP dip from $3.4 in January 2025 to $1.96 in June 2025. He claims that Wave 5 would push the XRP price significantly higher. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Trader Reveals 14x Gains, Predicts $5 as Next Stop , The Path to $13 for XRP If things evolve as predicted by Severino, the XRP market would hit the $13 market within the next six weeks. His six-week timeline is actually based on XRP’s historic 2017 bull run, where the cryptocurrency peaked six weeks after a similar pattern breakout. What Comes After the $13 XRP Peak? While the immediate future looks bright, Severiono warns that, after potentially hitting $13, XRP might experience a major market correction, possibly forming an ABC corrective pattern as per Elliott Wave Theory. In conclusion, Severino’s analysis paints an exceptionally bullish picture for XRP in the short term, supported by strong technical breakouts and Elliott Wave patterns. However, he also reminds investors that even strong rallies are often followed by corrections. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-23 11:25:23+00:00,Urgent Alert: OKX Delisting Seven Margin Trading Pairs on July 23,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Alert: OKX Delisting Seven Margin Trading Pairs on July 23 In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, staying updated with exchange announcements is not just important, it’s absolutely critical for every trader. A recent announcement from OKX, one of the leading global cryptocurrency exchanges, has sent ripples across the trading community. Effective July 23, 2024, at 11:00 UTC , OKX will proceed with the significant OKX delisting of seven specific margin trading pairs. This move requires immediate attention from anyone holding or trading these assets on the platform. What’s Happening? A Closer Look at the OKX Delisting OKX officially announced on its website that it will cease support for margin trading on the following seven pairs. This means that users will no longer be able to open new margin positions or maintain existing ones after the specified time. Here’s a clear breakdown: Trading Pair Delisting Date & Time (UTC) RDNT/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 ID/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 AIDOGE/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 XCH/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 CSPR/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 CTC/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 JOE/USDT July 23, 2024, 11:00 This coordinated OKX delisting of these specific pairs signals a strategic adjustment by the exchange, aiming to optimize its offerings and maintain a robust trading environment. For traders involved with these assets, understanding the implications is the first step towards mitigating potential risks. Why Do Exchanges Delist Trading Pairs? Understanding the Rationale Behind Crypto Delisting The decision by an exchange like OKX to delist certain margin trading pairs is rarely arbitrary. It’s usually a calculated move driven by several factors, all aimed at ensuring the health and integrity of the trading platform. Understanding these reasons can help traders anticipate future delistings and make more informed decisions. Low Liquidity: One of the primary reasons for a crypto delisting is insufficient trading volume and liquidity. Pairs with low liquidity can lead to significant price slippage, making it difficult for traders to enter or exit positions without impacting the market price. Exchanges prefer to allocate resources to more active markets. Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving. Exchanges must adhere to strict guidelines in various jurisdictions. A token or trading pair might be delisted if it no longer meets regulatory standards or poses a compliance risk. Project Performance and Viability: Exchanges regularly review the performance and development of listed projects. If a project becomes inactive, fails to meet its roadmap goals, or exhibits security vulnerabilities, an exchange might choose to delist its token to protect users. Market Demand and Strategic Focus: Sometimes, delistings are part of a broader strategy to refine the exchange’s offerings. If certain pairs no longer align with the exchange’s market focus or user demand shifts, they might be removed to streamline the platform and enhance efficiency. Security Concerns: Any security vulnerabilities discovered in a project’s underlying blockchain or smart contracts can trigger an immediate delisting to prevent potential hacks or exploits that could harm users. This particular OKX delisting likely stems from a combination of these factors, as the exchange continuously strives to offer a secure and efficient trading experience. Impact on Traders: Navigating the Consequences of Delisted Margin Trading Pairs For traders actively engaged with these seven margin trading pairs , the announcement carries significant implications. It’s not just about closing positions; it’s about understanding the potential financial ramifications and taking proactive steps. Forced Liquidation: If you have open margin positions on any of the delisted pairs, OKX will likely initiate forced liquidation if you do not close them before the deadline. This can occur at unfavorable market prices, leading to unexpected losses. Loss of Trading Opportunity: Traders who rely on these specific pairs for their strategies will need to find alternative assets or exchanges, potentially disrupting their trading plans and requiring new market analysis. Asset Conversion/Withdrawal: While margin trading will cease, users typically retain their spot holdings of these tokens. However, they will need to convert them to other assets or withdraw them from OKX if they wish to continue trading them elsewhere, incurring potential fees and time delays. Market Volatility: Delisting announcements can sometimes trigger increased volatility for the affected assets as traders rush to close positions or move their funds. This can present both risks and limited opportunities for very nimble traders. The key takeaway is that inaction is not an option. Every trader with exposure to these assets must act decisively to manage their risk effectively due to the impending OKX delisting .

2025-07-23 11:40:23+00:00,MARA Holdings Unveils Ambitious $850 Million Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy,"BitcoinWorld MARA Holdings Unveils Ambitious $850 Million Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy In a move that has sent ripples across the cryptocurrency landscape, U.S. crypto mining powerhouse MARA Holdings , formerly known as Marathon Digital, has announced a significant strategic shift. The company intends to issue an astounding $850 million in 0% convertible notes. This substantial capital raise is primarily earmarked for the acquisition of more Bitcoin (BTC), alongside repaying $50 million in existing notes and addressing general corporate purposes. This bold financial maneuver by MARA Holdings underscores a growing trend among crypto-native companies to fortify their balance sheets with the very digital asset they help create. Unpacking MARA Holdings ‘ Ambitious $850 Million Strategy The decision by MARA Holdings to issue $850 million in 0% convertible notes is a sophisticated financial play that deserves a closer look. But what exactly are convertible notes, and why are they being offered at a 0% interest rate? What are Convertible Notes? These are a type of debt instrument that can be converted into a specified number of common shares of the issuing company at a predetermined price or a specified future date. Essentially, they start as debt but have the potential to become equity. The 0% Interest Rate Explained: The lack of interest payments makes these notes particularly attractive to the issuer ( MARA Holdings ). Investors are willing to accept 0% interest because the primary return comes from the potential appreciation of the company’s stock once the notes convert. If the stock price rises significantly, the conversion becomes very profitable. It also signals confidence from the company that its stock price is likely to increase, making conversion a desirable outcome for investors. Allocation of Funds: The $850 million raised by MARA Holdings isn’t just for Bitcoin. The allocation is strategic: A significant portion will go towards purchasing more Bitcoin, directly increasing the company’s BTC holdings. $50 million is allocated to repay existing notes, demonstrating financial prudence and debt management. The remainder is for general corporate purposes, providing flexibility for operational needs, expansion, or other strategic investments. This financial instrument allows MARA Holdings to raise substantial capital without immediate dilution of existing shares, while also betting on the future appreciation of both its stock and Bitcoin. Why Bitcoin? The Strategic Imperative for MARA Holdings For a company whose core business is Bitcoin mining, increasing its direct Bitcoin holdings might seem intuitive, but it’s a strategic decision with multiple layers of benefit. Why would MARA Holdings choose to deploy such a large sum into acquiring more BTC? Holding Bitcoin directly offers several compelling advantages for a mining company: Direct Exposure to Price Appreciation: By holding more BTC, MARA Holdings directly benefits from any increase in Bitcoin’s market price, amplifying potential returns beyond just the profits from mining operations. It transforms a portion of their treasury into a growth asset. Hedging Against Mining Volatility: The profitability of Bitcoin mining can fluctuate significantly with changes in Bitcoin’s price, mining difficulty, and energy costs. A substantial BTC treasury can act as a hedge, providing a stable asset base during periods of lower mining profitability. Strengthening Balance Sheet: For a crypto-native company, a strong Bitcoin treasury can be viewed as a robust asset, signaling financial strength and long-term vision to investors who understand the digital asset space. It’s a strategic asset that aligns with their core mission. Operational Flexibility: A large Bitcoin reserve can provide liquidity for future investments, operational expenses, or even share buybacks, without needing to liquidate mining infrastructure or raise additional capital through traditional means. This move positions MARA Holdings not just as a miner, but as a significant holder and proponent of Bitcoin, intertwining its financial fate even more closely with the digital gold. Navigating the Nuances: Risks and Rewards for MARA Holdings and Investors While the strategy appears ambitious and potentially lucrative, it’s crucial to consider both the opportunities and the inherent risks involved for MARA Holdings and its investors. Potential Rewards: Enhanced Shareholder Value: If Bitcoin’s price continues its upward trajectory, and MARA Holdings ‘ stock performs well, the conversion of notes into equity could be highly profitable for noteholders, reflecting positively on the company’s overall valuation. Market Leadership: Increasing its Bitcoin treasury solidifies MARA Holdings ‘ position as a major player in the crypto mining and holding space, potentially attracting more institutional investment and market attention.

2025-07-23 11:50:10+00:00,XRP''s July Uptrend Threatened as Bitcoin''s $120K Price Resistance Holds,"This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Bitcoin: Rangeplay continues with MACD teasing bearish flip Bitcoin (BTC) hit a record high above $123,000 on July 14, before entering a period of consolidation. Prices have since been range-bound between resistance at $120,000 and support at $116,000, with bulls once again failing to establish a foothold above the former in the past 24 hours. This choppy trading, along with the flattening of the intraday moving averages and the daily MACD histogram hinting at a bearish shift, has increased the risk of a pullback. Still, the uptrend line from the June lows remains intact, keeping hopes alive for a bullish resolution that could lead to new record highs. AI''s take: Bitcoin is showing weakening momentum as it consolidates below the $120,000 resistance, with the MACD histogram hinting at a potential bearish shift. Resistance: $120,000, $123,181. Support: $116,000, $115,739, $111,965. XRP: July bullish trend threatened Like BTC, XRP (XRP) has lacked clear directionality lately, trading choppy between $3.35 and $3.65. What has changed in the past 24 hours is that the trendline representing the price rise from $2.2 to record highs has been breached, strengthening the case for a bearish resolution of the recent range play. Further, the spread between Bollinger bands has widened to levels that presaged the December correction. Bollinger bands are volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the asset''s 20-day simple moving average. In case the lower end of the recent range fails to hold, there would be a risk of an extended down move. AI''s take: While the Bollinger Band spread at a multi-year high points to extreme volatility and a coming breather, the breach of the uptrend line warrants caution for bulls. Resistance: $3.65, $4 Support: $3.35, $3, $2.65. Ether: Consolidation likely as Bollinger Bands widen Ether''s (ETH) sharp ascent from its June lows near $2,200 has paused this week, with prices pulling back to $3,600 from a high of $3,850. A short-term consolidation in a broad range looks likely, as the daily chart''s Bollinger Bands have widened to their highest level since April-May 2021. This widening is a classic technical signal that the market has experienced a period of extreme volatility and strong directional movement, suggesting it may now be due for a period of ranging or a ""breather"" before its next major move. This view is supported by the 14-day relative strength index, which has topped in the so-called overbought or above-70 zone. AI''s take: Ether''s rally has pushed its RSI above 70 and widened its Bollinger bands to their highest level since 2021, both signaling an extremely overbought market. Resistance: $4,000, $4,109 , $4,382. Support: $3,480, $3,081, $2,879. SOL: Looks north Solana''s SOL (SOL) has pulled back to under $200 as of writing. Still, the bull case remains intact, as suggested by the upward-sloping intraday and daily chart moving averages. The Bollinger Bands have widened to their highest level since the first quarter, ending a prolonged low-volatility coil to suggest bullish directionality. Additionally, the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) appears on track to move above the 200-day SMA in what''s known as the bullish golden cross. All of this suggests that SOL could tap the upper end of the rising channel with a potential move to $215 and higher. AI''s take : The price action is contained within a well-defined ascending channel, demonstrating that the rally from the April lows is a strong and consistent uptrend. The recent breakout to the upper half of this channel further reinforces the bullish momentum. Resistance : $218, $252-$264. Support : $187-$185, $163 (the 50-day SMA), $145.

2025-07-23 12:00:39+00:00,"Bitcoin $250,000, Ether $10,000 By Year-End? Arthur Hayes Thinks So","Arthur Hayes has never been shy about big numbers, but his latest essay, Time Signature, frames those targets inside a sweeping macro thesis: a wartime‑style US credit boom that—if it unfolds as he expects—could send Bitcoin and crypto markets into their largest bubble yet. Writing on 22 July, the BitMEX co‑founder argues that financial markets, like dancers, must keep time with the “kick drum” of credit creation. “If we are out of time, we lose money,” he warns, before identifying the beat he believes traders must follow today: US wartime industrial policy, or what he bluntly calls a shift toward economic “fascism.” Hayes centres his argument on the Pentagon’s newly announced deal with MP Materials, under which the US Defense Department will become the miner’s largest shareholder, guarantee a floor price for critical rare‑earth elements at twice China’s current market rate, and back a $1 billion bank loan to build a Nevada processing plant. The structure, he writes, is the template for “QE 4 Poor People,” a credit‑multiplier that expands the money supply without formal Congressional approval. Related Reading: Trump Shares Viral Bitcoin Breakdown — Here’s What He Posted In his schematic example a single commercial‑bank loan to MP Materials “creates $1,000 of new fiat wampum,” then ripples outward as wages, deposits and discounted Treasury borrowing. “The money multiplier is > 1, and this wartime production leads to an increase in economic activity, which is accounted for as ‘growth,’” Hayes observes. The result, he says, is inevitable inflation, yet also “government‑guaranteed profits” for banks and industry. Why Bitcoin And Crypto Is The Bubble Of Choice Hayes’ historical analogy is China’s 1990s–2020s property boom, where a five‑thousand‑percent expansion of M2 forced households into apartments, inflating land values and local‑government coffers. In the United States, he contends, the socially acceptable pressure valve will be digital assets. Two policy shifts underpin that call. First, retirement plans—an $8.7 trillion pool—may now allocate to crypto under a recent executive order. Second, the Trump campaign’s floated proposal to eliminate capital‑gains tax on digital assets could, in Hayes’ words, provide “insane war‑driven credit growth” with “no fucking taxes.” The broader attraction for politicians, he claims, is demographic: younger and more diverse investors own crypto in greater proportions than they own equities, so a bull market would “create a broader, more diverse set of people who are pleased with the ruling party’s economic platform.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation To Altcoins Is Collapsing: A Warning Sign? Even a credit‑fuelled boom must find an audience for the mounting federal deficit. Hayes’ solution is the stablecoin sector, which already places most of its assets under custody in US Treasury bills. On-chain data, he notes, suggest that roughly nine cents of every new dollar in total crypto market value migrates into stablecoins. “Let’s assume that Trump propels the total crypto market cap to $100 trillion by 2028,” he writes; “that would create roughly $9 trillion in T‑bill purchasing power.” The mechanism recalls World War II financing, when the Treasury skewed issuance toward short‑term bills. In Hayes’ view, a self‑reinforcing loop emerges: wartime procurement fuels credit expansion, higher credit lifts crypto, larger crypto capitalization feeds stablecoin demand for T‑bills, and those purchases backstop further deficits. Trading Tactics—And The Year‑End Call Against that macro backdrop Hayes declares his investment vehicle, Maelstrom, “fully invested,” and explains why: “It’s pretty simple: Maelstrom is fully invested. Because we are degens, the shitcoin space offers amazing opportunities to outperform Bitcoin, the crypto reserve asset. Ether has been the most hated large-cap crypto. No more; the Western institutional investor class, whose chief cheerleader is Tom Lee, loves Ether. Buy first, ask questions later.” His numerical convictions are explicit: Bitcoin $250,000 and Ether $10,000 by 31 December 2025.

After consolidating in the $1.20–$1.27 zone for the past week, WLD is riding the wave of a broader altcoin market recovery—gaining over 20% in the past seven days. Bolstered by high trading volumes, favorable technical signals, and increasing adoption of its World ID ecosystem, the WLD price appears to be primed for a significant move. Now that the Worldcoin price is undergoing a correction, the question arises whether it will be restrained from reaching $2. Price Structure Tightens as Bulls Defend Support Worldcoin is currently trading at $1.27, well above the $1.20 support that has held firm over the past week. Price action is tightening below the 0.236 FIB levels at $1.435, a continuation pattern that often resolves upward if the levels are secured. Momentum indicators are aligning: RSI sits near 65 after plunging from 80, pointing towards a correction. 200-MA is offering a strong base and hence the pullback could be reversed if the price continues to drop Volume is rising, signaling strong accumulation and also an increase in the volatility. If bulls can sustain a close above $1.28, the door opens to a quick rally toward $1.50. Beyond that, the next key zone sits around $1.70, a level not seen since early May. However, if $1.20 breaks, downside risks include a drop to $1.05. WLD Riding Wave of Altcoin Rotation and On-Chain Demand This move isn’t happening in isolation. WLD is benefiting from a broader altcoin resurgence, with capital rotating out of Bitcoin and into high-potential Layer-1 and identity-based tokens. More importantly, Worldcoin’s fundamentals are catching up with its hype. The expansion of Orbs (biometric identity scanners) to over 46 countries is driving adoption of the World ID protocol. Strategic partnerships—with brands like Tinder (Match Group) and Story Protocol—add utility and relevance. WLD token usage may spike as World ID becomes more integrated into real-world apps, potentially increasing demand. Altogether, this growing use case backs the price action, adding fuel to the technical breakout setup. Beyond project-level factors, macro sentiment is turning supportive. With expectations of a U.S. interest rate cut in September, liquidity may start to return to risk-on markets—including crypto. At the same time, recent U.S. regulatory developments, like the GENIUS Act, are reinforcing investor confidence in compliant crypto projects. Moreover, as the capital flows back into altcoins, technically backed, utility-driven tokens like Worldcoin (WLD) are expected to benefit the most.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/worldcoin-wld-price-eyes-1-50-breakout-will-the-current-pullback-hinder-the-30-rally-ahead/,TRADING|WLD|ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,Price Analysis|Altcoins,BTC,"Worldcoin (WLD) Price Eyes $1.50 Breakout—Will the Current Pullback Hinder the 30% Rally Ahead?.

In fact, spot Ethereum ETFs have extended their 12-day inflow streak. On July 21 alone, spot BTC ETFs saw $131 million in outflows. This represented the first net withdrawals during this rally toward Bitcoin’s all-time high, while spot ETH ETFs recorded $297 million in inflows. Divergence in ETF Flows CryptoRank stated that the divergence could simply reflect institutional investors taking profits after Bitcoin’s 10% gain in July and over 25% rise year-to-date, which is a logical rebalancing after a strong run. Spot Bitcoin ETF 12-day inflow streak ended. Spot Ethereum ETF 12-day inflow streak continues.

ETH ETFs continue to attract capital, with record inflows of $726 million on July 16 and $297 million on July 21, which pushed cumulative new inflows to $7.78 billion. Additionally, ETH has surpassed BTC in terms of daily derivatives volume over the past week as well, which reflects strong trading activity. Ethereum appears to be benefiting from capital rotation , ETF-driven FOMO, and a potential altseason, with the altseason index near 60, its highest in months. While these signs reflect a potential pivot in investor sentiment, CryptoRank noted there is nothing bearish in BTC’s current outflows. The analytics firm views them as standard rebalancing rather than a sign of weakening fundamentals. Overall, the continuation of ETH ETF inflows amid Bitcoin’s pause could mark the beginning of a market rotation toward Ether and large-cap alts. Near-Term Pullback Concerns However, as Ethereum continues to attract institutional flows, some investors are questioning if its recent momentum could lead to a near-term pullback. Despite the concerns, analysts note the current market is far from overheating. Compared to the futures market peaks in March and November 2024, Ethereum’s present positioning appears modest, which means that any pullback would likely be shallow and brief. Throughout this cycle, the altcoin’s price action has remained sluggish despite an ongoing uptrend. It even dipped into undervalued territory before clearly bottoming out. This positions Ethereum for further upside potential in the second half of 2025.

Thanks to the recent inflow of liquidity in crypto markets, analysts and crypto experts are offering fresh insights into market trends and likely winners in this cycle. Pepe Coin and the Race to $100 Billion Market Cap Pepe Coin, the crypto industry’s largest frog-based meme coin, is one of the altcoins analysts are touting as a serious contender for the top crypto to buy now in the market. Analysts have made several bold predictions about the meme coin, including a bold Pepe price prediction of up to $20 and a rally to hit a $100 billion market cap by the end of the ongoing cycle. If previous cycles are to be taken into context, it becomes undeniably clear that this “impossible feat” is most definitely possible for Pepe Coin. At the height of the meme coin rally last year, Pepe Coin hit an all-time high market cap of $11 billion, an impressive feat considering most of the attention and liquidity during that cycle were on meme coins based on Solana and Base. With mindshare and capital more evenly distributed during this cycle, analysts believe Pepe Coin could experience a surge in both price and market cap.

2025-07-23 12:15:42+00:00,Colorado pastor and wife indicted in $3.4M crypto scam; ''God told him'' to shill INDXcoin,"A Colorado-based online pastor and his wife have been indicted after allegedly swindling millions of dollars from religious followers through a crypto scheme. Eli Regalado, a self-proclaimed pastor in Denver, and his wife, Kaitlyn Regalado, are accused of using “faith in God” to defraud investors through the promotion and sale of a digital token called INDXcoin. The indictment was handed down on Tuesday, including 40 criminal counts against the couple. Denver District Attorney John Walsh said the two are being sued for breach of trust, because the alleged fraud involved the manipulation of religious faith and language to entice victims. “These charges show our work to hold the Regalados accountable for their alleged crimes and to bring a measure of justice to the victims,” Walsh said in a statement. 40 criminal counts for fraudulent faith investments Between January 2022 and July 2023, the Regalados raised approximately $3.4 million from more than 300 investors, many of whom were members of their Christian community. Excerpts from the Relegados indictment. Source: denverda.org They promoted INDXcoin through their online ministry and associated platforms, where Eli Regalado reportedly told investors that “God told him” to promote the token sold via a platform called Kingdom Wealth Exchange. The couple claimed the crypto would bring substantial returns, is less volatile and risky than other digital assets. According to the INDXcoin whitepaper, the token was “insulated” from the hazards of crypto trading. The Denver pastor and his wife insisted INDX was not a “pump and dump” scheme, and asserted that its value was backed by the momentum of the crypto market. According to redacted court documents seen by Cryptopolitan, the couple exaggerated the potential of INDXcoin, stating it could become a top-ten cryptocurrency and a stable store of value, competing with stablecoins and providing higher returns. Prosecutors say these promises were deceptive and unsupported. The token, according to authorities, “maintained zero value,” causing complete losses for the hundreds who invested. Investigators found that little of the funds raised were actually used to support or develop the token, and the Regalados allegedly diverted at least $1.3 million toward personal expenses. These include luxury retail purchases, credit card bills, cosmetic and medical procedures, airline tickets, and home renovations. The indictment also notes they used investor funds to pay for food, auto-related bills, au pair services, manicures, and other non-business costs. Eli Regalado allegedly told followers that “the Lord” had instructed him to renovate their home.. Enterprises and RICO allegations The court documents also revealed several entities tied to the Regalados’ faith crypto fraud , including INDXCOIN INC., INDXCOIN LLC, Grace Led Marketers, Kingdom Wealth Exchange companies, along with Victorious Grace Church. “Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado owned or controlled Mad Hatter Agency/Grace Led Marketers/Grace Led Marketing, Victorious Grace Church, INDXcoin/INDXcoin LLC, Kingdom Wealth Exchange LLC/Kingdom Wealth Exchange. Only Mad Hatter Agency/Grace Led Marketers/Grace Led Marketing and Victorious Grace Church were registered with the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office to conduct business within the State of Colorado,” the prosecution wrote. The organizations were allegedly used to build credibility among the couple’s followers while creating a financial structure to conceal their fraudulent activities. At the time of the alleged scheme, Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado were operating INDXcoin, LLC out of a residence located at 2355 South Eudora Street in Denver, Colorado. Even though the company was functioning from that address, INDXcoin, LLC was never registered to legally conduct business in the state, according to the indictment. Both Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado were charged under Colorado’s organized crime laws for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity while participating in the operation of these enterprises. The first count of the indictment cites violations of Sections 18-17-104(3) and 18-17-105 of the Colorado Revised Statutes, which deal with racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations (RICO) offenses.

Enterprises and RICO allegations The court documents also revealed several entities tied to the Regalados’ faith crypto fraud , including INDXCOIN INC., INDXCOIN LLC, Grace Led Marketers, Kingdom Wealth Exchange companies, along with Victorious Grace Church. “Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado owned or controlled Mad Hatter Agency/Grace Led Marketers/Grace Led Marketing, Victorious Grace Church, INDXcoin/INDXcoin LLC, Kingdom Wealth Exchange LLC/Kingdom Wealth Exchange. Only Mad Hatter Agency/Grace Led Marketers/Grace Led Marketing and Victorious Grace Church were registered with the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office to conduct business within the State of Colorado,” the prosecution wrote. The organizations were allegedly used to build credibility among the couple’s followers while creating a financial structure to conceal their fraudulent activities. At the time of the alleged scheme, Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado were operating INDXcoin, LLC out of a residence located at 2355 South Eudora Street in Denver, Colorado. Even though the company was functioning from that address, INDXcoin, LLC was never registered to legally conduct business in the state, according to the indictment. Both Eli and Kaitlyn Regalado were charged under Colorado’s organized crime laws for engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity while participating in the operation of these enterprises. The first count of the indictment cites violations of Sections 18-17-104(3) and 18-17-105 of the Colorado Revised Statutes, which deal with racketeering influenced and corrupt organizations (RICO) offenses.

In a recent blog post , Hayes laid out his thesis, tying the potential price surge to U.S. President Donald Trump’s economic policies and what he describes as a shift to a wartime economy. Crypto to Thrive Under Trump’s Industrial Strategy, Says Arthur Hayes According to Hayes, the return of Trump has ushered in a credit-heavy economic strategy designed to increase industrial output, especially in areas like rare earths and defense manufacturing. Hayes believes this approach, which mirrors aspects of economic planning in China, will flood the system with credit. That, he argues, will create favorable conditions for risk assets, especially crypto. “If we are to remain beautiful and prosperous, to which instrument within the financial markets must we tune our ears?” Hayes wrote, comparing financial markets to music and investing to dance. He believes this wave of government borrowing will be indirectly supported by stablecoins, as issuers increasingly invest user funds into U.S. Treasury bills. As crypto adoption grows, so does the capital held in stablecoins, money that flows into government debt markets and helps fund the federal deficit. According to Hayes, this forms a loop between crypto and traditional finance: credit creation boosts crypto demand, stablecoins funnel cash into Treasuries, and the government recycles that capital into more credit. He calls it a “credit waltz.” Hayes also suggested that Trump-era regulatory changes, such as allowing 401(k) retirement funds to include crypto or potentially eliminating capital gains tax on digital assets, could deepen institutional involvement in the space. While Bitcoin remains his primary focus, Hayes believes Ethereum may outperform in the next cycle. He cited renewed institutional interest in Ethereum and shifting attention from faster chains like Solana back to larger, more established assets.

His predictions reflect a growing narrative among crypto advocates: that a highly leveraged, credit-fueled economy will benefit digital assets more than ever before. Bitcoin and Ethereum Eye Long-Term Highs, But Short-Term Resistance Looms While Arthur Hayes has projected long-term price targets of $250,000 for Bitcoin and $10,000 for Ethereum, current technical indicators suggest that both assets may encounter short-term resistance before any further upward movement. Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at around $118,200, up 8.7% in the past week. However, despite the price surge, 24-hour trading volume has declined by over 10%, down to $49.2 billion, suggesting weaker momentum behind the rally. Analysts caution that the recent rise lacks strong follow-through, a warning sign for traders expecting an imminent breakout. According to Glassnode lead analyst James Check, the lack of growing volume raises doubts about Bitcoin reaching the $200,000 mark this year.

2025-07-23 12:20:07+00:00,BNB Hits New ATH at $800 as Altseason Index Holds Above 50 – Is Altseason Finally Here?,"Binance Coin ( BNB ) reached a new all-time high of $800 as the Altseason Index climbed to 51, prompting Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao to predict that “FOMO season” may be approaching amid growing evidence of capital rotation from Bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies. The milestone coincides with Bitcoin dominance falling 5.8% in one week to under 61%, marking its lowest point since March and steepest decline since June 2022. Source: CoinMarketCap The metric had peaked near 66% at month-end, suggesting the critical inflection point that historically precedes major altcoin rallies. Altseason Index Shows a Possible Breakout CoinMarketCap’s Altcoin Season Index surged from just 16 a month ago to 51 this week. However, it remains below the 75 threshold that signals an official “altseason,” when at least 75 of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over 90 days. Source: CoinMarketCap Current market rotation patterns mirror historical cycles where Bitcoin rallies first before capital flows into Ethereum and broader altcoin markets. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization surged from $3 trillion to $3.8 trillion over three weeks, with Ethereum gaining 110% during the same 90-day period. Meanwhile, meme coins like BONK (+148.7%) and FLOKI (+119.1%) posted triple-digit returns. In fact, lower-cap projects, including PENGU , recorded gains exceeding 500%. Technical analysis suggests Bitcoin dominance may be approaching cyclical highs around 65-67%, following a declining trend from 97% in 2017 to 73% in 2021. The pattern indicates that each successive cycle sees Bitcoin maintaining a smaller market share at peaks, potentially setting the stage for sustained altcoin outperformance through 2025. Technical Indicators Signal Capital Rotation Phase Beginning Bitcoin dominance charts reveal a multi-cycle pattern connecting three major peaks: 2017 at 97%, 2021 at 73%, and a projected 2025 peak around 65-67%. The descending trendline suggests that Bitcoin’s current dominance may be approaching its cyclical high before shifting to alternative cryptocurrencies, which are seeking higher returns. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC ratio appears to be bottoming in demand zones while Bitcoin dominance approaches resistance around 65-70%. This inverse relationship often becomes apparent when capital is rotating, with the ETH/BTC ratio typically rising as Bitcoin’s dominance declines. Altcoin market cap projections suggest potential expansion from the current $3.6 trillion to over $16 trillion, representing a possible 10,000% growth, following historical patterns of 18,000% in the first cycle and 12,000% in the second cycle. Each expansion phase has reached progressively higher absolute levels despite moderating percentage gains. The four-phase capital rotation framework suggests that markets may be transitioning from Phase 1 (Bitcoin dominance) to Phase 2 (Ethereum leadership). BULLISH: THE CRYPTO CAPITAL ROTATION CYCLE SHOWS THAT ALTSEASON IS COMING! pic.twitter.com/B40ZZ1TeCD — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) July 23, 2025 Phase 2 typically sees money flowing into Ethereum while initially struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum beginning to outperform Bitcoin consistently. BNB’s breakthrough to $800 represents the type of major altcoin leadership that emerges during Phase 2, where established layer-1 platforms and major altcoins begin outperforming Bitcoin. Historical Precedent Supports Altseason Development Theory Previous altseasons have followed predictable patterns, starting with Bitcoin rallies that boost overall sentiment and liquidity, before capital shifts into Ethereum and other alternative cryptocurrencies. The 2017-2018 altseason saw Bitcoin dominance collapse from 87% to 32% as ICO mania and Ethereum’s rise drove market cap from $30 billion to $600 billion. The 2020-2021 cycle saw Bitcoin’s dominance drop from 70% to 38% as DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins captured the attention of investors. Major altcoins, such as Dogecoin, surged in April 2021, as the altcoin season index reached 98, with the total altcoin market cap doubling during the explosive phase. Current market conditions mirror these historical setups, with Bitcoin having established new highs before stabilizing. The declining Bitcoin dominance trend from previous cycles suggests 2025 may see the third major altcoin expansion, potentially reaching massive absolute dollar amounts due to a larger market base. Ethereum’s 110% gain over 90 days, compared to Bitcoin’s relative stability, suggests that the rotation mechanism is in effect. The Altcoin Season Index, which climbed from 16 to 51 in one month, indicates accelerating momentum, although an official altseason is typically defined by crossing the 75 threshold. Historical data shows rapid acceleration once rotation begins, with major altcoins typically posting gains exceeding 170% compared to Bitcoin’s modest performance during peak altseason periods.

Technical Indicators Signal Capital Rotation Phase Beginning Bitcoin dominance charts reveal a multi-cycle pattern connecting three major peaks: 2017 at 97%, 2021 at 73%, and a projected 2025 peak around 65-67%. The descending trendline suggests that Bitcoin’s current dominance may be approaching its cyclical high before shifting to alternative cryptocurrencies, which are seeking higher returns. Furthermore, the ETH/BTC ratio appears to be bottoming in demand zones while Bitcoin dominance approaches resistance around 65-70%. This inverse relationship often becomes apparent when capital is rotating, with the ETH/BTC ratio typically rising as Bitcoin’s dominance declines. Altcoin market cap projections suggest potential expansion from the current $3.6 trillion to over $16 trillion, representing a possible 10,000% growth, following historical patterns of 18,000% in the first cycle and 12,000% in the second cycle. Each expansion phase has reached progressively higher absolute levels despite moderating percentage gains. The four-phase capital rotation framework suggests that markets may be transitioning from Phase 1 (Bitcoin dominance) to Phase 2 (Ethereum leadership). BULLISH: THE CRYPTO CAPITAL ROTATION CYCLE SHOWS THAT ALTSEASON IS COMING! pic.twitter.com/B40ZZ1TeCD — Coinvo (@ByCoinvo) July 23, 2025 Phase 2 typically sees money flowing into Ethereum while initially struggling to keep pace with Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum beginning to outperform Bitcoin consistently. BNB’s breakthrough to $800 represents the type of major altcoin leadership that emerges during Phase 2, where established layer-1 platforms and major altcoins begin outperforming Bitcoin. Historical Precedent Supports Altseason Development Theory Previous altseasons have followed predictable patterns, starting with Bitcoin rallies that boost overall sentiment and liquidity, before capital shifts into Ethereum and other alternative cryptocurrencies. The 2017-2018 altseason saw Bitcoin dominance collapse from 87% to 32% as ICO mania and Ethereum’s rise drove market cap from $30 billion to $600 billion. The 2020-2021 cycle saw Bitcoin’s dominance drop from 70% to 38% as DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins captured the attention of investors. Major altcoins, such as Dogecoin, surged in April 2021, as the altcoin season index reached 98, with the total altcoin market cap doubling during the explosive phase. Current market conditions mirror these historical setups, with Bitcoin having established new highs before stabilizing. The declining Bitcoin dominance trend from previous cycles suggests 2025 may see the third major altcoin expansion, potentially reaching massive absolute dollar amounts due to a larger market base. Ethereum’s 110% gain over 90 days, compared to Bitcoin’s relative stability, suggests that the rotation mechanism is in effect. The Altcoin Season Index, which climbed from 16 to 51 in one month, indicates accelerating momentum, although an official altseason is typically defined by crossing the 75 threshold. Historical data shows rapid acceleration once rotation begins, with major altcoins typically posting gains exceeding 170% compared to Bitcoin’s modest performance during peak altseason periods.

2025-07-23 12:23:42+00:00,"This $0.03 Crypto Is Quietly Gaining Steam, 100x Gains Projected By BTC Investors Soon After Listing","The post This $0.03 Crypto Is Quietly Gaining Steam, 100x Gains Projected By BTC Investors Soon After Listing appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Top decentralized finance platforms often begin quietly—low visibility and limited capital—but later reward early backers with massive returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is following this classic blueprint. Now in its presale, muted buzz conceals fierce interest from prudent BTC investors tracking these rare 100x opportunities. With the token priced at $0.03 and an upcoming listing pegged at $0.06, early participants are positioning themselves for gains that could eclipse those seen in previous DeFi cycles. What will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) particularly compelling is its dual-lending architecture, designed to deliver both stable yield and high-risk rewards. In the upcoming Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system, investors will be able to deposit major stablecoins and blue-chip assets into overcollateralized lending pools. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The presale narrative gains momentum near its midpoint: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $12.9 million to date and attracted over 13,900 token holders. With 90% of the Phase 5 allocation already sold, only a sliver of tokens remains at the $0.03 price point. In just days, the entry cost will spike to $0.035, delivering an instant 20% return. For investors who aim for a 100x surge post-listing, those final tokens at the lower price are the most strategic spot. Explosive Yield Meets Portfolio Flexibility For users looking to preserve long-term positions without selling, the borrowing side will offer overcollateralized loans in stablecoins. For instance, a borrower depositing $200,000 SOL will be able to access up to 75% of their collateral value in assets like 140,000 USDD. This feature will empower users to unlock liquidity while retaining upside exposure to SOL’s future appreciation—avoiding taxable events and maintaining strategic portfolio control. Mutuum Finance’s upcoming P2P lending feature is set to unlock high-risk, high-reward strategies compensating high risk assets and memcoins like TRUMP and FLOKI, that seasoned investors may appreciate. At the heart of the platform’s capital efficiency lies mtTokens—ERC-20 tokens minted when assets are deposited. These instruments represent fractional shares of the liquidity pool and automatically accrue both principal and interest. That means earnings accumulate in real-time, with no need for manual claims or compounding. Investors can track yield growth transparently—and even stake mtTokens to earn dividends in MUTM sourced from platform revenue. When users decide to exit, they simply return mtTokens to the smart contract and redeem their deposited assets plus all interest earned. One investor who joined during Phase 1 invested $20,000 into MUTM tokens at $0.01, securing 2 million tokens. With the presale now in Phase 5 at $0.03, that holding has already tripled in value. Once the token lists at $0.06, the return climbs to 6x, and when post-launch targets of $0.30 materialize, the upside reaches a staggering 30x. This projected growth isn’t without reason—the Mutuum team is preparing to launch its beta platform alongside the token listing, giving users a real-world product to engage with. That utility, combined with rising user interest, could attract further investor demand and increase the likelihood of listings on major exchanges—two factors that naturally support higher price levels. Security, Incentives, and Investor Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prioritizes safety. The project has undergone a comprehensive CertiK audit, achieving an impressive Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 77.50. To further secure the protocol against emerging threats, a $50,000 bug bounty program is now live, rewarding bug hunters for identifying vulnerabilities across severity tiers. Early believers are being recognized through an aggressive rewards structure. Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 token giveaway , in which ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The project’s rapidly growing community—boasting over 12,000 followers on X—is a testament to the traction building behind the scenes. Quiet and calculated, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gathering momentum among those who expect big moves from strategic presale positioning. With just 10% of tokens left at the current price, smart money is making its move before the price rises. If you’re watching the crypto space for a stealthy 100x setup, this may be your chance—because at $0.03, the door to explosive returns is still open.

2025-07-23 12:48:47+00:00,Bank of England Rethinks CBDC Plans,"BoE Governor Andrew Bailey recently suggested that improvements in commercial payment systems may eliminate the need for a CBDC, which is a major shift from the institution''s earlier pro-CBDC stance. The project also faced strong public backlash, privacy concerns, and slow progress, leaving the UK trailing behind other nations in CBDC development. Meanwhile, UK authorities seized seven illegal crypto ATMs in London and arrested two people in a crackdown on unregistered operations. Similar concerns are being addressed in the US, where lawmakers are pushing for consumer protections and regulations due to the spike in crypto ATM-related scams. CBDC Support Fades in the UK Britain''s central bank is reportedly reconsidering its plans for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), casting doubt on the future of the so-called digital pound. According to a Bloomberg report citing anonymous sources, the Bank of England (BoE) is facing increasing skepticism about whether a consumer-facing digital currency will actually provide tangible benefits to the financial system or the institution itself. BoE officials are said to be encouraging commercial banks to focus on improving existing payment systems rather than relying on the creation of a new digital form of money. Governor Andrew Bailey explained during a Treasury Committee hearing on Tuesday that if commercial innovations in payments prove successful, there may be no compelling reason to issue a digital pound. He said, “If that’s a success, I question why we need to introduce a new form of money.” This apparent shift is a retreat from the BoE’s earlier position. In 2023, Bailey stated that a digital pound would ”likely” be needed in the future, mostly due to strong institutional support at the time. However, progress has been slow. The Atlantic Council’s CBDC tracker indicates that the UK is still in the development phase and is lagging behind other nations in its CBDC rollout. The project also faced a lot of public pushback, with over 50,000 largely critical responses to a request for public feedback. Concerns about consumer privacy, potential bank runs during crises, and threats from foreign or tech-backed stablecoins further complicated the digital pound’s prospects. The broader international momentum behind CBDCs also seems to be mixed. In the United States, lawmakers recently passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, effectively banning any Federal Reserve efforts to develop a CBDC without explicit congressional approval. Some critics, including Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene , argue that stablecoin regulation bills like the GENIUS Act could still allow for a CBDC to emerge indirectly through privately issued tokens. Global CBDC progress (Source: Atlantic Council ) Despite the hesitation in the UK and US, global interest in CBDCs is strong. According to the Atlantic Council , three countries—The Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria—already launched digital currencies. Meanwhile, 49 countries are in the pilot phase, 20 are actively developing their projects, and 36 are still in the research stage. UK Cracks Down on Illegal Crypto ATMs Authorities in the UK also recently seized seven cryptocurrency ATMs and arrested two people in southwest London on suspicion of money laundering and operating an illegal crypto exchange. The operation was led by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in collaboration with the Metropolitan Police. (Source: FCA ) Since January of 2021, all crypto-related services in the UK are required to register with the FCA and comply with anti-money laundering regulations. Currently, no crypto ATMs are legally operating in the country, and using or managing one without proper authorization is considered a criminal offense. Therese Chambers, the executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, explained that any illegal operation of crypto ATMs or exchanges will result in serious consequences. She warned that using these unregistered machines not only violates the law but also contributes to criminal activity. The suspects in the recent enforcement action were released under investigation as inquiries continue. Across the Atlantic, US lawmakers are also responding to the growing risks associated with crypto kiosks. In Wisconsin, a new bill that was introduced by state Senator Kelda Roys and Representative Ryan Spaude seeks to establish regulations to protect consumers from fraud, hidden fees, and scams linked to digital currency machines. The proposal was made in response to a surge in crypto-related scams across the state, which pushed legislators to call for transparency, consumer education, and stricter legal protections. Phishing scams are still one of the most common forms of fraud involving crypto ATMs, where victims are deceived into sending digital currency to fraudsters posing as legitimate authorities. According to the FBI, these kinds of scams resulted in approximately $247 million in losses in 2023 alon",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10110/bank-of-england-rethinks-cbdc-plans,FIAT|REGULATION|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET,News|Crypto,BTC,"Bank of England Rethinks CBDC Plans.

2025-07-23 13:04:23+00:00,US Moves to Seize $7.1M in Crypto Linked to Oil and Gas Investment Scam,"The United States is pursuing the forfeiture of $7.1 million in cryptocurrency seized by Homeland Security in December, tied to an alleged oil and gas investment scam that ran for two years. The Seattle US Attorney’s Office announced on Tuesday that it filed a civil action to seize a portion of the $97 million collected in the suspected scam, which operated between June 2022 and July 2024. Acting US Attorney Teal Luthy Miller stated that the “co-schemers in this fraud moved their ill-gotten gain through various cryptocurrency accounts to try to launder the money stolen from victims.” Scam Laundered Victim Funds Through Crypto Accounts The crypto accounts targeted for forfeiture reportedly belong to individuals in Russia and Nigeria, who allegedly used victims’ funds to purchase cryptocurrencies before transferring a portion to exchanges in their home countries. Authorities believe these transactions were part of efforts to disguise the origins of the stolen funds while enabling the perpetrators to access the funds globally. Prosecutors allege that investors were promised profits through a scheme claiming to purchase and rent out oil tank storage facilities. However, after receiving the funds, the alleged operators would cease communication, leaving victims without recourse. Key Arrests and Regulatory Crackdown Continue One individual, Geoffrey Auyeung, was indicted in August 2024 for allegedly playing a central role in laundering the stolen funds. Auyeung is accused of purchasing Bitcoin, Tether, USDC, and Ether with the illicit proceeds and sending most of the crypto to Binance. At the time of his arrest, US authorities seized nearly $2.3 million from his bank accounts. Prosecutors have so far identified victims who lost $17.9 million, with expectations that additional victims will come forward to claim losses as investigations continue. Should the court approve the $7.1 million forfeiture, the total reclaimed funds would rise to $9.4 million, which would then be distributed to verified victims of the alleged scam. The case forms part of a broader clampdown by US regulators targeting crypto-related fraud . Earlier this month, prosecutors charged two OmegaPro promoters accused of defrauding investors of $650 million. A former rugby player was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison for a $900,000 Ponzi scheme. Additionally, Hong Kong police recently arrested four individuals linked to a $382,000 crypto fraud, although the suspected ringleader remains at large. The latest US action reflects the government’s commitment to recovering assets tied to crypto scam while reinforcing efforts to protect investors in a rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.

2025-07-23 13:24:18+00:00,One in four Russian parents would spend Putin birth benefit on BTC,"Two-thirds of Russian families would like to invest financial assistance granted by the state to boost fertility, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are among the most favored options. According to a new survey, the majority of moms and dads don’t have a clear idea about what they may do with the one-time benefit given for the birth of a child in Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Few families in Russia know what they can spend maternity pay on Only a fifth of Russian parents are aware of the things they can buy with the government aid to support birth rate, a recently conducted poll has found. About 19% knew the exact list of options, the Gazeta.ru news portal reported on Wednesday. More than half, 54%, could name just a few, and 27% did not understand the question. Strangely enough, more women (34%) than men (22%) didn’t know about the possible ways to spend the money, according to the study by the Renaissance Insurance Group. The poll is focused on what authorities in Moscow call “Maternity Capital,” a federal subsidy meant to encourage Russian families to have more children. Launched in 2007, the program has been providing financial assistance to married couples upon the birth or adoption of a second or subsequent child. Since 2020, it has been expanded to include first-borns as well. This year, the amount granted for a first child is more than 690,000 Russian rubles (almost $8,800), and almost 222,000 rubles (over $2,800) for the second and subsequent children, if the family has already received the first grant. Parents don’t get the cash. Instead, they receive a special certificate that they can use for various purposes, such as improving living conditions by renovating their home, for example, making a down payment for a mortgage or contributions to a retirement fund. Asked to name some categories of costs they would like to cover, the largest group, 32%, said buying a car. The top three answers also included using the funds as a safety net for unexpected or important expenses (28%) and to pay medical bills (22%). Another 21% of the respondents shared they would rather spend the state aid on cosmetic home repairs, while almost as many, or 20%, said they wanted to finance training courses to improve their professional qualifications. One in four Russian parents want to invest maternity money in crypto The authors of the survey established that a significant portion of the participants are ready to make riskier investments. Among them, they listed stocks (30%), bonds (26%), and last but not least – 26% admitted they would consider acquiring crypto assets . On the question of who should control spending, 38% of the polled were categorical that parents should have that privilege. Among parents, men are more likely than women to support this view, 41% against 35%, respectively. Some 17% are convinced that such decisions should be made by all people in a household, and 45% are ready to entrust the management of the maternity capital to their children, although over half of them emphasized reaching a certain age before handing over control. Putin’s aid comes with a number of caveats that Russians were recently warned about in another article published by Gazeta.ru in mid-June. For example, when buying a new home, every family member should be allocated a share, as required by law. This can seriously complicate any future deals with an apartment, according to Russian realtor Maria Krets, who explained: “In order to sell a home in which a child holds a share, it’s necessary to obtain permission from the authorities … a confirmation that the child’s living conditions will improve after the sale.” “In practice, this means parents need to take care of purchasing alternative real estate in advance, where the child’s rights will be fully respected,” the realtor elaborated.

Among them, they listed stocks (30%), bonds (26%), and last but not least – 26% admitted they would consider acquiring crypto assets . On the question of who should control spending, 38% of the polled were categorical that parents should have that privilege. Among parents, men are more likely than women to support this view, 41% against 35%, respectively. Some 17% are convinced that such decisions should be made by all people in a household, and 45% are ready to entrust the management of the maternity capital to their children, although over half of them emphasized reaching a certain age before handing over control. Putin’s aid comes with a number of caveats that Russians were recently warned about in another article published by Gazeta.ru in mid-June. For example, when buying a new home, every family member should be allocated a share, as required by law. This can seriously complicate any future deals with an apartment, according to Russian realtor Maria Krets, who explained: “In order to sell a home in which a child holds a share, it’s necessary to obtain permission from the authorities … a confirmation that the child’s living conditions will improve after the sale.” “In practice, this means parents need to take care of purchasing alternative real estate in advance, where the child’s rights will be fully respected,” the realtor elaborated.

The Financial Times, citing anonymous sources “familiar with the matter,” reports that the top global investment bank could start lending against crypto assets next year. JPMorgan, which declined to comment to FT, would likely have to employ a third-party platform to custody crypto assets seized from customers who default on their loans. The potential development clashes with JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon’s past criticisms of crypto. Dimon has called Bitcoin a “pet rock” and argued there are no real use cases for the top crypto asset other than illicit transactions. In 2024, however, he argued that people should have the right to trade BTC regardless of his personal feelings about the asset. “Now my last statement, the last time I ever talk about Bitcoin, is I defend your right to do Bitcoin. I think it’s okay. I don’t want to tell you what to do. So my personal advice is don’t get involved, but I don’t want to tell anybody what to do. It’s a free country.” JPMorgan Chase recently informed fintech companies such as PayPal, Venmo and Coinbase that they will need to begin paying to access their customers’ bank account information, according to a Bloomberg report. The fintech companies use the information, which has been free, to make it easier for their customers to send, receive and trade money.

2025-07-23 13:30:45+00:00,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX Moves Bitcoin Holdings For The First Time In 3 Years, Here’s Where It Went","Elon Musk’s SpaceX has raised eyebrows in the crypto community, following the transfer of its Bitcoin holdings for the first time in three years. This has raised concerns about the possibility of the company looking to offload its coins. Elon Musk’s SpaceX Transfers Bitcoin Holdings To A Fresh Address In an X post, onchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence revealed that Elon Musk’s SpaceX just moved Bitcoin for the first time in three years. The company sent 1,300 BTC ($153 million) to a fresh address this morning. Arkham then questioned whether this transfer was simply a move to cycle custody wallets or a plan to sell. Related Reading: The Final Bitcoin Act: Here’s What To Expect As BTC Trends Sideways SpaceX transferred the funds to an unknown wallet (bc1q8….phartf), which suggests that this move is just for custody purposes rather than to sell them. Notably, the last time Elon Musk’s company moved some of its Bitcoin holdings was to Coinbase, three years ago, which was more of an indication to sell than this recent transfer. There is a possibility that Elon Musk’s SpaceX would have likely moved this $153 million to Coinbase again, rather than to a new address, if it intended to offload these coins. Arkham data shows that the coins in the fresh address remain untouched following the transfer. Meanwhile, it is worth noting that the company still holds 6,977 BTC ($827.41 million) in its recognized wallets. SpaceX first disclosed its Bitcoin holdings in 2021. This was around the same time that Elon Musk’s Tesla also announced it had purchased Bitcoin and was exploring the possibility of accepting BTC as a payment option. Arkham data shows that Tesla 11,509 BTC, worth around $1.37 billion. Tesla hasn’t moved any of its coins in the last nine months. Meanwhile, the company also ranks as the 10th largest public Bitcoin treasury, according to BitcoinTreasuries’ data. Musk’s Belief In Bitcoin Is Growing Elon Musk’s belief in Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge looks to be growing, which again makes it unlikely that SpaceX is looking to offload its coins with its recent transfer. Earlier this month, the world’s richest man confirmed that his America Party will embrace Bitcoin as “fiat is hopeless.” He made this comment amid the passing of the Big Beautiful Bill, which increases government spending and is bullish for BTC since it has a limited supply compared to the dollar.

The timing also aligns with rising tensions over SpaceX’s government contracts and broader efforts by Elon Musk to integrate crypto into his companies’ ecosystems. SpaceX now reportedly holds nearly 7,000 BTC, valued at over $800 million. SpaceX Transfers $153M in Bitcoin SpaceX quietly moved 1,308 Bitcoin, worth around $153 million. This was its first on-chain activity in three years. The transfer was flagged by Arkham Intelligence , which noticed that the Bitcoin was withdrawn from 16 Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) addresses and consolidated into a single SegWit-compatible Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH) address. This move is believed to be a strategic consolidation that may simplify management and reduce future transaction costs. While neither SpaceX nor its founder Elon Musk commented on the action, the timing coincides with rising political tensions and potential shifts in government contracts. The Pentagon recently announced its intention to diversify contractors for the $175 billion Golden Dome missile defense system, due to concerns over its dependence on SpaceX. This development follows reports from June that the Trump administration considered reviewing or canceling up to $22 billion in contracts with the company thanks to a public dispute between Musk and the president. Musk’s engagement with cryptocurrency has been volatile . In 2021, his promotion of Dogecoin led to a price surge before a dramatic crash. Tesla, another Musk-led firm, bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin the same year and briefly accepted it as payment before reversing the decision due to environmental concerns. Some of those holdings were later sold. After his acquisition of Twitter, which was then rebranded as X, Musk began pushing toward creating a broader financial ecosystem. X has since acquired money transmitter licenses in multiple US states, and backend code has hinted at the development of a native crypto wallet, although no crypto features have launched publicly.

2025-07-23 13:55:23+00:00,"Bitcoin Accumulation: Matador Technologies’ Bold $100M Quest for 6,000 BTC","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Accumulation: Matador Technologies’ Bold $100M Quest for 6,000 BTC In a significant move that underscores the growing institutional confidence in digital assets, Matador Technologies, a company listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, has just secured a colossal $100 million financing facility. This substantial funding is earmarked for an ambitious goal: to aggressively expand its Bitcoin accumulation holdings, with a clear target of accumulating up to 6,000 BTC by 2027. This bold strategic decision, initially reported by crypto analyst @btcNLNico on X, marks a pivotal moment, signaling a deepening commitment from publicly traded entities towards the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Accumulation: Matador Technologies’ Ambitious $100M Funding The announcement of Matador Technologies’ $100 million financing facility sends a powerful message to the market. For a company listed on a prominent stock exchange like the TSX Venture, dedicating such a substantial sum specifically to Bitcoin accumulation highlights a long-term conviction in BTC’s value proposition. This isn’t merely a speculative play; it suggests a strategic allocation designed to bolster the company’s balance sheet and potentially drive future growth through exposure to the digital asset space. Key details of this monumental move include: Significant Capital Injection: A $100 million financing facility provides Matador with considerable firepower to execute its acquisition strategy without immediately depleting existing operational capital. Clear Target: The goal of accumulating 6,000 BTC by 2027 is a precise and ambitious objective, indicating a well-defined roadmap for their digital asset portfolio expansion. Public Company Endorsement: Matador Technologies’ status as a publicly traded entity lends credibility and visibility to the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, potentially encouraging other traditional finance players to consider similar strategies. Long-Term Vision: The 2027 target horizon suggests a belief in Bitcoin’s sustained appreciation over the medium to long term, looking beyond short-term market fluctuations. This development is particularly noteworthy as it reflects a broader trend of corporations seeking to diversify their treasury holdings with non-traditional assets, especially those perceived as inflation hedges or stores of value in an uncertain economic climate. Understanding Matador’s Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy Matador Technologies’ plan to accumulate 6,000 BTC isn’t just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about executing a sophisticated Bitcoin accumulation strategy within the confines of a publicly traded company. This involves careful consideration of market timing, liquidity, and regulatory compliance. While the exact mechanics of their purchasing strategy haven’t been fully disclosed, companies typically employ several methods: Over-the-Counter (OTC) Desks: For large-volume purchases like those Matador intends, OTC desks are often preferred. They allow for private transactions, minimizing market impact and ensuring price stability for significant buys. Direct Exchange Purchases: While less likely for such large sums due to potential slippage, a portion could be acquired through major cryptocurrency exchanges. Strategic Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Rather than a single lump-sum purchase, Matador might employ a DCA strategy, buying smaller amounts of BTC regularly over time to mitigate volatility risks. This aligns well with their multi-year accumulation target. Beyond the acquisition, securing these assets is paramount. Matador will need robust custody solutions, likely involving institutional-grade cold storage providers, to protect their substantial Bitcoin holdings from cyber threats and unauthorized access. The decision to embark on such an aggressive Bitcoin accumulation path suggests a thorough risk assessment and a strong conviction in the asset’s future. The Strategic Imperative: Why Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation? Matador Technologies is not operating in a vacuum. Their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy aligns with a growing narrative among institutional investors and corporations that view Bitcoin as a legitimate, long-term asset. But why are more and more institutions turning to BTC? Bitcoin as a Digital Gold: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a modern-day digital equivalent to gold. Its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it inherently scarce, providing a strong hedge against currency debasement. Diversification Benefits: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer diversification benefits, as its price movements are often uncorrelated with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds, especially over longer time horizons.

Strategic Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Rather than a single lump-sum purchase, Matador might employ a DCA strategy, buying smaller amounts of BTC regularly over time to mitigate volatility risks. This aligns well with their multi-year accumulation target. Beyond the acquisition, securing these assets is paramount. Matador will need robust custody solutions, likely involving institutional-grade cold storage providers, to protect their substantial Bitcoin holdings from cyber threats and unauthorized access. The decision to embark on such an aggressive Bitcoin accumulation path suggests a thorough risk assessment and a strong conviction in the asset’s future. The Strategic Imperative: Why Institutional Bitcoin Accumulation? Matador Technologies is not operating in a vacuum. Their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation strategy aligns with a growing narrative among institutional investors and corporations that view Bitcoin as a legitimate, long-term asset. But why are more and more institutions turning to BTC? Bitcoin as a Digital Gold: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a modern-day digital equivalent to gold. Its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins makes it inherently scarce, providing a strong hedge against currency debasement. Diversification Benefits: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer diversification benefits, as its price movements are often uncorrelated with traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds, especially over longer time horizons. Future-Proofing the Balance Sheet: Companies are recognizing that embracing digital assets is not just about speculation, but about positioning themselves for the future o"
2025-07-23 13:56:36+00:00,Analyst: Low Bitcoin Flow to Exchanges Points to High Market Confidence,"Bitcoin’s most recent rally has sparked investor conviction rather than the sort of panic selling seen in previous bull cycles. Key on-chain metrics show a surprising trend: major holders aren’t moving their crypto to exchanges despite prices hovering just below all-time highs. The Confidence Signal According to a July 23 post by CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain, the Bitcoin Flow Pulse (BFP) indicator shows an unusually low volume of BTC heading to exchanges, even after the cryptocurrency hit a record $123,091, per CoinMarketCap, indicating a strong belief in the sustainability of the uptrend. Historically, spikes in BTC flowing into exchanges were usually signs of the intent to sell, increasing readily available supply, and often foreshadowing price drops. Arab Chain interpreted the absence of such a spike now as a bullish signal of strong hands holding firm. Bitcoin’s price journey reflects this tug-of-war between confidence and caution. While the asset is up 16.2% over the past month and 8.9% in two weeks, it has entered a consolidation phase since hitting its ATH nine days ago. Data from CoinGecko shows it was trading between $118,042 and $120,222 in the last 24 hours, but is facing resistance near $123,000. Furthermore, technical analysis from CryptoVizArt suggests there is potential for a deeper correction towards the $107,000 to $111,000 Fibonacci support zone if key near-term levels around $113,000 to $116,000 fail to hold. Whales Accumulate, Outlook Uncertain Elsewhere, CryptoQuant also revealed there has been an uptick in retail selling pressure, specifically on Binance. Inflows from smaller traders have jumped significantly on the exchange, and Net Taker Volume has turned negative, probably showing bearish sentiment among this cohort. Meanwhile, deep-pocketed investors are hoovering up everything in the market. On-chain data shows that $200 million in BTC was withdrawn from exchanges yesterday, suggesting the heavy hitters are capitalizing on the aforementioned retail fear. The divergence between the activities of these two classes echoes patterns seen earlier this year, when the flagship cryptocurrency rose from $78,000 to $111,000 within a few weeks. The market is now balanced on a knife-edge. While the low exchange inflows indicated by the BFP hint at strong high-conviction holding, profit-taking in some quarters and persistent retail selling have also introduced near-term headwinds that will need to be accounted for.

2025-07-23 14:00:49+00:00,"SEC Set To Shake Up Bitcoin, Ethereum ETFs With In-Kind Approval","The US Securities and Exchange Commission is edging toward a structural makeover of spot‑Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange‑traded funds, after five Cboe BZX‑listed products simultaneously asked to swap their cash‑only creation and redemption model for the in‑kind mechanics long used by commodity and equity ETFs. Filings submitted late on 22 July cover the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF and the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF (together in SR‑CboeBZX‑2025‑010 Amendment No. 3), WisdomTree’s Bitcoin Fund (SR‑CboeBZX‑2025‑033 Amendment No. 1) and both the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund and Fidelity Ethereum Fund (SR‑CboeBZX‑2025‑023 Amendment No. 1). Each amendment rewrites language inserted in early‑2024 approval orders that had locked the trusts into cash creations and redemptions, substituting the phrase “cash or in‑kind transactions” and adding detailed settlement workflows for direct transfers of Bitcoin or Ether between the trust’s custodian and an authorised participant. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart, who first spotted the coordinated move, told his followers on X that the quintet of filings is “more positive signs regarding Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs obtaining the ability to do in‑kind creation and redemption… This indicates to me that there is positive movement and likely fine‑tuning happening with the SEC.” Anticipating confusion, he added: “No, this is not going to be for retail or normies to trade in shares of their ETFs for the underlying asset or vice versa. This would only be for the Authorized Participants (think big wall street firms and market makers) This will make current and future crypto ETFs more efficient. But the vast majority of people won’t even see a difference because the products on the market now already trade extremely efficiently. This will treat crypto ETPs the same as other ETPs are treated.” Commenting on a time horizon when retail investors could use the in-kind redemption process, Seyffart added: “Would be cool to see consumers being able to withdraw and deposit actual ETH into the ETF with a certain threshold. I personally think withdrawals like this will eventually happen. But it may be in the distant future. One step at a time. This already exists for some gold ETFs.” Why In-Kind Matters For Bitcoin And Ether ETFs Under the cash model imposed when spot Bitcoin ETPs were finally approved on 10 January 2024, an AP delivers dollars to the fund, which then buys the cryptocurrency in the spot market; redemptions reverse the process. That design solved SEC concerns under Chair Gensler about custody and settlement risk but introduced two frictions: the trust itself must trade in the underlying market, and the resulting order flow can push net asset value away from share price when spot liquidity is thin. In‑kind processing hands those trades back to authorised participants. When creating shares the AP ships Bitcoin or Ether directly to the fund’s cold‑wallet; when redeeming it receives coins instead of cash. The structure is standard in the broader ETF ecosystem and is associated with tighter spreads, smaller primary‑market imbalances and material tax advantages because portfolio securities — or in this case, crypto‑assets — are released “in kind” rather than being sold and realising capital gains inside the fund. The SEC itself notes that ETFs “can be more tax efficient… because ETF shares generally are redeemable ‘in‑kind’. Commodity trusts already employing in‑kind redemptions provide the regulatory template the crypto issuers are invoking. SPDR Gold Shares, for example, lets an authorised participant exchange a 100,000‑share basket for physical bullion, a feature that ultimately allows an individual investor to “take physical possession of the gold backing his or her shares,” albeit through a broker‑facilitated arrangement. By mirroring that language, the Bitcoin and Ether trusts argue they are simply seeking parity with existing commodity ETPs. Operational pressure has also mounted as primary‑market volumes grow. Since launch the eleven spot Bitcoin ETFs approved in 2024 have drawn nearly $55 billion in cumulative net inflows; market‑making desks face the hurdle of sourcing billions of dollars at 4 p.m. every settlement day — then unwinding the crypto exposure after the trust purchases coins. This ties up the balance sheet and widens spreads during volatile sessions.

2025-07-23 14:05:19+00:00,Crypto Liquidations Unleash a $113 Million Shockwave in the Market,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Liquidations Unleash a $113 Million Shockwave in the Market In the fast-paced, often unpredictable world of digital assets, moments of extreme volatility can send a genuine shockwave through the market. Recently, the cryptocurrency community witnessed one such event, with a staggering $113 million worth of futures liquidated in just one hour across major exchanges. This sudden flush was part of an even larger picture: a colossal $409 million worth of futures liquidated over the past 24 hours. These numbers aren’t just figures on a screen; they represent real money, real traders, and a powerful reminder of the inherent risks and rewards in crypto futures trading. But what exactly are these crypto liquidations , and what do they mean for you and the broader market? Understanding the Mechanics of Crypto Liquidations Before diving deeper into the recent market movements, it’s crucial to understand the core concept of crypto liquidations . Simply put, a liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is forcibly closed by an exchange due to a significant loss. This happens because the trader’s margin balance (the collateral they put up for their leveraged trade) falls below a certain threshold required to keep the position open. It’s an automated process designed to prevent a trader’s losses from exceeding their initial margin and to protect the exchange from potential bad debt. Think of it like this: Leverage: You borrow funds from an exchange to amplify your potential returns. If you have 10x leverage, a $1,000 investment controls $10,000 worth of crypto. Margin: Your initial $1,000 is your margin, acting as collateral. Price Movement: If the market moves against your position, your losses start eating into your margin. Margin Call/Liquidation Price: The exchange calculates a ‘liquidation price’. If the asset’s price hits this point, your position is automatically closed to prevent further losses. This mechanism, while a safeguard for exchanges, can be brutal for traders, especially during periods of high volatility. The recent event highlights just how quickly fortunes can turn when trading with leverage. The Recent Shockwave: Numbers Behind the Carnage The numbers from the past 24 hours paint a stark picture of the market’s recent turbulence. A rapid price swing, likely triggered by a significant market event or a cascade of selling pressure, led to a domino effect of liquidations. Here’s a quick breakdown of the reported figures: Timeframe Total Futures Liquidated Impact Past Hour $113 Million Sudden, concentrated losses for highly leveraged positions. Past 24 Hours $409 Million Broader market impact, indicating sustained volatility. These figures indicate that many traders were caught on the wrong side of a rapid price movement, often amplified by high leverage. While specific details about which coins or exchanges saw the most liquidations are not provided in the initial report, it’s typical for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) futures to account for the largest share of such events due to their high trading volumes and liquidity. Why Do Such Massive Crypto Liquidations Occur? Massive crypto liquidations are not random events; they are typically the culmination of several factors interacting within a volatile market. Understanding these triggers is key to appreciating the risks involved in futures trading: Sudden Price Swings: The most direct cause. A rapid pump or dump in price can quickly push leveraged positions to their liquidation points. High Leverage: While leverage can magnify gains, it equally magnifies losses. The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement needed to trigger a liquidation. Many traders, seeking quick profits, often over-leverage, making them extremely vulnerable. Market Sentiment and News: Negative news (e.g., regulatory crackdowns, major hacks, economic downturns) or shifts in market sentiment can lead to panic selling, causing prices to tumble rapidly and trigger liquidations. Whale Activity: Large traders or institutions (‘whales’) can execute massive trades that significantly impact prices, intentionally or unintentionally triggering a cascade of liquidations. Cascading Liquidations: When one set of liquidations occurs, the forced selling can further depress prices, leading to more liquidations, creating a dangerous feedback loop. This ‘liquidation cascade’ can exacerbate market downturns. The recent $113 million hourly flush suggests a particularly sharp, unexpected price movement caught a large number of long or short positions off guard, indicating the market’s inherent sensitivity to sudden shifts. Impact on the Crypto Market: A Ripple Effect? When significant crypto liquidations occur, their effects ripple far beyond the individual traders involved. What kind of impact can we expect to see? Increased Volatility: Liquidations often lead to more price swings as forced selling adds downward pressure, or forced buying (in the case of short ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-liquidations-market-shockwave/,MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|EXCHANGE|BTC,Crypto News|Crypto Liquidations|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Futures Trading|market volatility|Trading Strategy,BTC,"Crypto Liquidations Unleash a $113 Million Shockwave in the Market.

2025-07-23 14:09:12+00:00,Ether ETFs Extend Inflow Streak Surpasses $8.3B as Demand Outpaces Supply,"Spot Ether ETFs continue to attract strong institutional interest, marking 13 consecutive days of net inflows as appetite for Ethereum exposure grows. On Tuesday, these funds recorded a net inflow of $533.87 million, pushing the cumulative net inflows since July 2 to over $8.32 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led with a $426.22 million daily net inflow, expanding its assets under management to over $10 billion and solidifying its lead in the Ether ETF space. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $35 million in daily inflows, reflecting continued confidence among investors. Ether ETFs Hit New Milestones The inflow streak saw its highest daily record on July 16, with over $720 million , followed by $602.02 million on July 18, underscoring a wave of institutional buying. Spot Ether ETFs now collectively hold $19.85 billion in assets, representing 4.44% of Ethereum’s market cap. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, noted that the sustained inflows are driven by “falling BTC dominance and growing institutional appetite for ETH exposure,” indicating the trend could persist as liquidity improves and macro conditions remain stable. ETH Demand Surges as Supply Shrinks Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, highlighted that while Ethereum’s market cap is about 19% of Bitcoin’s, Ethereum ETFs currently hold less than 12% of the assets that Bitcoin ETPs manage. He predicts this gap will narrow as more companies add ETH to their balance sheets, projecting demand for an additional $20 billion worth of ETH over the next year—approximately 5.33 million ETH at current prices. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s network is expected to issue only around 0.8 million ETH over the same period, suggesting that demand could exceed new supply by nearly seven times. “In the short term, the price of everything is set by supply and demand. And for the time being, there is significantly more demand for ETH than there is new supply. I suspect we go higher,” Hougan said. On-chain data from Lookonchain further revealed that five new wallets withdrew a combined 76,987 ETH (worth $285 million) from Kraken on Wednesday, signaling ongoing accumulation and a declining exchange supply. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $67.93 million on Tuesday, with significant withdrawals from Bitwise’s BITB and Ark’s ARKB, marking a pause in the strong institutional buying Bitcoin ETFs witnessed earlier in July.

On Tuesday, these funds recorded a net inflow of $533.87 million, pushing the cumulative net inflows since July 2 to over $8.32 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led with a $426.22 million daily net inflow, expanding its assets under management to over $10 billion and solidifying its lead in the Ether ETF space. Fidelity’s FETH followed with $35 million in daily inflows, reflecting continued confidence among investors. Ether ETFs Hit New Milestones The inflow streak saw its highest daily record on July 16, with over $720 million , followed by $602.02 million on July 18, underscoring a wave of institutional buying. Spot Ether ETFs now collectively hold $19.85 billion in assets, representing 4.44% of Ethereum’s market cap. Vincent Liu, chief investment officer at Kronos Research, noted that the sustained inflows are driven by “falling BTC dominance and growing institutional appetite for ETH exposure,” indicating the trend could persist as liquidity improves and macro conditions remain stable. ETH Demand Surges as Supply Shrinks Matt Hougan, chief investment officer at Bitwise, highlighted that while Ethereum’s market cap is about 19% of Bitcoin’s, Ethereum ETFs currently hold less than 12% of the assets that Bitcoin ETPs manage. He predicts this gap will narrow as more companies add ETH to their balance sheets, projecting demand for an additional $20 billion worth of ETH over the next year—approximately 5.33 million ETH at current prices. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s network is expected to issue only around 0.8 million ETH over the same period, suggesting that demand could exceed new supply by nearly seven times. “In the short term, the price of everything is set by supply and demand. And for the time being, there is significantly more demand for ETH than there is new supply. I suspect we go higher,” Hougan said. On-chain data from Lookonchain further revealed that five new wallets withdrew a combined 76,987 ETH (worth $285 million) from Kraken on Wednesday, signaling ongoing accumulation and a declining exchange supply. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows of $67.93 million on Tuesday, with significant withdrawals from Bitwise’s BITB and Ark’s ARKB, marking a pause in the strong institutional buying Bitcoin ETFs witnessed earlier in July.

2025-07-23 14:15:18+00:00,Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Massive $227 Million Market Meltdown,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Massive $227 Million Market Meltdown The cryptocurrency market, known for its rapid shifts and dramatic swings, recently witnessed a startling event that sent ripples through trading desks worldwide. In a mere sixty minutes, an astonishing $227 million worth of crypto futures liquidation swept across major exchanges. This hourly figure alone highlights the intense volatility and the high-stakes nature of leveraged trading in digital assets. Extending this view, the past 24 hours saw an even more staggering $524 million worth of futures liquidated . Such significant events are not just numbers; they represent substantial losses for many traders and offer crucial insights into market dynamics. But what exactly is a crypto futures liquidation, and what does an event of this magnitude tell us about the current state of the crypto market? Understanding Crypto Futures Liquidation: What Just Happened? To grasp the gravity of a crypto futures liquidation , it’s essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of futures trading in the cryptocurrency space. A futures contract is essentially an agreement to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specified future date. Traders use these contracts to speculate on future price movements without owning the underlying asset directly. The allure, and often the danger, lies in leverage. Leverage allows traders to open positions much larger than their initial capital. For instance, with 10x leverage, a trader can control $10,000 worth of Bitcoin with just $1,000 of their own money. While this amplifies potential profits, it equally magnifies potential losses. When the market moves against a leveraged position, the trader’s equity (margin) decreases. If this equity falls below a certain threshold – known as the maintenance margin – the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for the trader and the exchange. This forced closure is what we call a crypto futures liquidation . The recent event, where $227 million worth of futures were liquidated in just one hour, suggests a sudden and sharp price movement in one direction, catching a large number of leveraged traders off guard. It typically happens when: Sudden Price Swings: An unexpected surge or drop in the price of a major cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin or Ethereum) triggers margin calls for many positions simultaneously. High Leverage: Traders using excessive leverage are more susceptible to liquidation, as even small price movements can wipe out their margin. Cascading Effects: Liquidations can trigger further price drops as large positions are force-sold, creating a domino effect that leads to more liquidations. The Immediate Impact: Analyzing the $227 Million Shockwave The rapid $227 million crypto futures liquidation within an hour, followed by the broader $524 million over 24 hours, indicates a period of extreme market volatility and significant directional pressure. Such a large-scale event points to a few key observations: Unsuspecting Traders Caught Off Guard: A substantial number of traders were likely positioned in the wrong direction, perhaps expecting a rally when the market dumped, or vice versa. This suggests a lack of robust risk management strategies among some participants. Dominant Market Direction: The sheer volume of liquidations in a short period usually signifies a strong, sustained move in one direction. For instance, if the majority of liquidated positions were ‘long’ (betting on price increase), it implies a sharp price decline. Conversely, if ‘short’ positions were liquidated, it indicates a sudden price pump. Exacerbated Volatility: Liquidations themselves can intensify market movements. When positions are force-closed, the underlying assets are sold (or bought) on the market, adding to the existing selling (or buying) pressure. This creates a feedback loop, accelerating price changes and leading to more liquidations. This kind of market event serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks in highly leveraged crypto derivatives trading. It highlights the importance of not only predicting market direction but also understanding the mechanics of how exchanges manage risk and how that impacts individual traders. Why Do Such Massive Crypto Futures Liquidations Occur So Frequently? While the recent crypto futures liquidation event was significant, similar incidents, albeit of varying magnitudes, are not uncommon in the crypto market. Several factors contribute to their frequent occurrence: 1. Unregulated Leverage: Unlike traditional finance, many crypto exchanges offer extremely high leverage options (up to 100x or even more). This allows traders to take on enormous risk with minimal capital, making them highly vulnerable to even minor price fluctuations. 2. 24/7 Market Activity: The crypto market never sleeps. This constant activity means price movements can occur at any time, catching traders off gu",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-futures-liquidation-meltdown/,MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|BTC|EXCHANGE,Crypto News|Crypto Futures|liquidation event|market volatility|risk-management|Trading Strategy,BTC,"Crypto Futures Liquidation: Unpacking the Massive $227 Million Market Meltdown.

2025-07-23 14:18:08+00:00,"Analysis Firm Matrixport Warns Bitcoin Investors: ""The Rally in BTC and Altcoins Isn''t Over, But Beware the Short Term!""","With only a week left until the highly anticipated FED interest rate decision, cryptocurrency company Matrixport has published its new analysis. At this point, Matrixport stated that cryptocurrency investors should be careful in the short term. Analysts pointed out that open interest and funding rates, especially in Bitcoin futures, are increasing together, and that the two increasing together could cause volatility in the short term. Analysts noted that Bitcoin open interest has increased by $6 billion in the last two weeks, while the annual funding rate has risen to 19 percent. Analysts said this was a sign that investors were aggressively taking long positions, and that this increase occurred alongside a sharp increase in retail crypto transaction volumes in South Korea, jumping from $1 billion to $6 billion. At this point, analysts stated that the significant increase in open position value, especially in Bitcoin futures, could create exaggerated optimism in the market and that there is a high probability that many opened long positions will be liquidated as a result. Although Matrixport expects volatility in the short term, it was stated that August is traditionally a quieter month in financial markets and that liquidity and volatility may decrease in August. Despite the near-term risks, Matrixport said it maintains its bullish outlook for the remainder of 2025 and expects the overall upward trend to continue with a number of key catalysts on the horizon, including the US FOMC meeting scheduled for next week. “Major catalysts are lining up for the post-summer period, and the overall crypto rally is not over yet, and the broader crypto uptrend is still intact.” *This is not investment advice.
