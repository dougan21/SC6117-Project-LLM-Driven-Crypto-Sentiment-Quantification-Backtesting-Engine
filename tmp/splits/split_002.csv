2025-07-18 06:00:06+00:00,Bitcoin''s Ancient Whale Selling Creates Perfect Accumulation Zone: Which Altcoins Will Boom in Price in Second Half of July,"A large, long-time holder of Bitcoin has recently offloaded a significant amount, paving the way for potential market shifts. This move has created a prime opportunity for investors to accumulate assets. With the second half of July approaching, key altcoins are poised for growth. Discover which digital currencies are expected to surge and make strategic investment choices. Ethereum Market Surge Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends Over the last month, Ethereum recorded a solid gain of 17.34%, but the past six months indicated a decline of 13.95%. A recent weekly growth of 16.85% shows a rebound, signaling renewed investor interest after a correction period. Price fluctuations have been characterized by significant volatility and shifting market sentiment. Current performance suggests a market that reacts to both short-term catalysts and longer-term adjustments, reflecting a mix of recovered momentum and residual downward pressure from previous trends. The trading range currently sits between $2110.94 and $2870.47, with bulls momentarily in control due to the impressive weekly and monthly gains. Key support levels are at $1735.29 and $975.76, while the nearest resistance is at $3254.35, with a second resistance at $4013.88. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index near 69 and positive readings on the Awesome Oscillator indicate upward pressure. Trading strategies might involve entering near lower support levels and planning exits around resistance markers. Traders should monitor breakout signs and momentum shifts to manage risk effectively. Solana Price Action: Mixed Past Trends, Bullish Levels, and Tactful Entries During the past month, Solana has shown promising gains with a 10.77% increase as traders began to see renewed interest and short-term momentum, evidenced by a recent 7.69% rise in just one week. Over the more extended six-month period, price performance was less robust, dropping 22.14%. Such fluctuations underline an asset that experiences significant volatility, with past price behavior marked by a balance of positive weekly moves and a longer-term downward pressure. The charts indicate a technical journey where rapid short-term gains contrast with broader declines, setting the stage for potential recovery or further correction under shifting market conditions. Current pricing rests in a range between $131 and $173.35, with notable support at $107.89 and resistance at $191.79. Bulls appear to be making inroads as indicated by the rise to 7.69% in the last week and reinforced by technical measures like a Relative Strength Index near 57. However, the lack of a clear trend demands cautious optimism. Levels beyond, such as second resistance at $233.74 and second support at $65.94, shape a trading corridor. Solid support zones could provide buying opportunities, while approaching resistance levels may trigger profit booking. A balanced trading approach, looking for entries around support and exits near resistance, seems prudent in capturing potential gains in the current market. ADA Market Update: Weekly Surge Amid Long-Term Pullback Cardano recorded a 25.52% gain over the past week and a 16.29% increase in the last month. The last six months showed a decline of 32.47%, pointing to a challenging long-term correction. Prices have moved within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, highlighting both quick rebounds and sustained pressure. These price shifts reflect mixed market sentiments and trading dynamics in both short and long terms. At present, ADA trades within the $0.48 to $0.70 range, with key support at $0.38 and resistance at $0.83. A second resistance exists at $1.05, while deeper support lies around $0.163. Technical indicators show an RSI at 68.96 and a moving average recommendation leaning positive. Bulls dominate the weekly outlook, though the six-month decline signals caution. Traders might consider entries near support levels and aim for exits at resistance zones, as the market currently shows short-term strength but an unclear long-term trend. Conclusion The recent sale of Bitcoin by an ancient whale has created a prime opportunity for investors. ETH , SOL , and ADA are poised to benefit from this shift. This period could see significant price increases for these coins as they attract more interest. ETH remains strong due to its versatile platform, SOL is noted for its fast transactions, and ADA is gaining attention with its continuous development. Savvy investors might find this an ideal moment to consider these options. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-18 06:09:00+00:00,Solana and Cardano Flash Buy Signals But Traders Are Fixated On Remittix’s 50x Potential,"Crypto traders searching for the best crypto to buy now have watched Bitcoin cool off while altcoins quietly reset. Two heavyweights, Solana and Cardano, just flashed fresh buy signals that hint at a mid‑summer rotation into “high‑growth crypto” plays. Yet the loudest chatter on X isn’t about Layer‑1 breakouts; it’s about Remittix , a DeFi project many early movers see as the next big crypto launch thanks to its real‑world payment rails and live presale bonus. Here’s how the technical and fundamental picture stacks up for all three. Solana: Coiling for a Breakout A base near $160 and rising on‑chain volume have put Solana (SOL) back on radar for traders hunting the next 100x crypto. Chart watchers compare the current structure to Bitcoin’s coil before its spring squeeze, noting that a daily close above the twin moving‑average cap around $169 could ignite a run to the $190–$200 zone. Source: Tradingview The network continues to post the highest daily transactions of any major L1, proving that a low gas fee crypto can still dominate throughput even in choppy markets. If that breakout materializes, analysts eye the inverse head‑and‑shoulders target at $219. Cardano: Regulatory Tailwinds in Waiting While SOL wrestles with resistance, Cardano (ADA) is catching speculative bids on the back of Washington’s proposed Clarity Act. Because more than 80 % of ADA is staked across thousands of pools, Cardano’s Ouroboros design ticks the “sufficiently decentralized” box regulators crave. Should the bill pass, ADA could move from undervalued crypto project to regulatory darling, particularly for investors chasing yield through crypto staking. Source: Tradingview Why Remittix Is the Real Headliner Early‑stage capital isn’t pouring into SOL or ADA right now, it’s flowing toward Remittix , a PayFi newcomer many are calling “XRP 2.0.” Reasons Remittix Is Gaining Traction: Cross‑Border Utility: Direct crypto‑to‑bank transfers in 30+ countries Non‑Custodial & Private: No IP tracking; supports ETH, BTC, SOL, XRP with low gas fees Explosive Presale Stats: $16.3M+ raised so far in what reviewers label the best crypto presale 2025 Deflationary Tokenomics: Every transfer burns RTX, aligning scarcity with adoption Big Bonus Window: 50 % extra tokens still live for those who want to buy RTX token before listings. Analysts peg a 50x upside if Remittix captures even a sliver of the $19 T remittance sector, an opportunity few other top crypto under $1 can claim. Little wonder whales diversifying out of centralized exchanges have started flagging RTX as a new altcoin to watch in Q3. Exit Velocity: Charts vs. Cash Flow SOL and ADA both flash convincing buy signals: Solana on pure momentum, Cardano on potential legislative clarity. Yet the biggest buzz is swirling around Remittix , a PayFi rail that could convert meme‑era enthusiasm into sustainable volume.

This event is larger than last week’s expiry but unlikely to be enough to influence spot markets, which have been performing solidly this week. ‘Crypto Week’ in the United States has been chaotic , but the House passed the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts on Thursday, giving markets a boost. Meanwhile, Bitcoin cooled from its Monday all-time high while Ethereum finally lifted off after a year in the doldrums. Massive wins for crypto in the House: GENIUS Act passes 307-122. CLARITY Act passes 294-134. — David Sacks (@davidsacks47) July 17, 2025 Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s tranche of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.69, meaning that there are more calls expiring than put contracts. There is also a max pain point of $113,000, around $7,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $120,000, with more than $2.3 billion at this strike price. There is also more than $2 billion OI at $130,000 and $140,000 strike prices as the bulls speculators load up on contracts.

In addition to today’s batch of Bitcoin options, there are around 243,000 Ethereum contracts that are also expiring, with a notional value of $750 million, a max pain point of $2,900, and a put/call ratio of 1.0. This brings Friday’s combined crypto options expiry notional value to around $5.7 billion. Crypto Market Outlook The crypto market rally has continued as the week comes to an end, with total capitalization hitting an all-time high of over $4 trillion. The top three digital assets are driving market momentum at the moment. Bitcoin has returned to $120,700 during the Friday morning Asian trading session as it erases weekly losses and moves to 2% from its all-time high. Ethereum is surging with an 8% daily gain to reach $3,600, its highest level since early January. The move has been primarily driven by huge ETF inflows and a new wave of Ethereum treasury companies.

2025-07-18 06:37:28+00:00,Crypto Market Cap Nears $4 Trillion as Bitcoin and Altcoins Surge Following Key US Legislation,"The total crypto market cap is rapidly approaching the $4 trillion mark, propelled by strong gains in Bitcoin, Ether, XRP, and other major cryptocurrencies. Key Takeaways: The total crypto market cap has surged past $4 trillion, driven by gains in Bitcoin, Ether, and XRP. The US House passed three key crypto bills, boosting investor confidence and fueling the market rally. Trump’s family’s extensive crypto holdings raise concerns over conflicts of interest. The surge follows the US House of Representatives passing three significant crypto-related bills just before the August recess. According to CoinMarketCap , the crypto market cap peaked around $3.8 trillion, while TradingView put the figure closer to $3.9 trillion, both surpassing the previous record of $3.73 trillion set in December. Crypto Market Cap Surpasses $4 Trillion Milestone Meanwhile, CoinGecko has already reported that the market cap has crossed the $4 trillion milestone. Bitcoin regained its footing above $120,000 on Thursday, experiencing modest daily gains. Ether surged 8%, topping $3,600 for the first time since January, marking a 40% increase over the last two weeks. Meanwhile, XRP experienced a dramatic spike of nearly 20%, reaching a year-to-date high of $3.64 early Friday. JUST IN: The total crypto market cap has hit a new ATH of $4T. pic.twitter.com/gE8hRFegwz — CoinGecko (@coingecko) July 18, 2025 Reaching a $4 trillion market cap would place cryptocurrencies just behind Nvidia, the world’s largest publicly listed company, which recently surpassed the same valuation. The recent legislative momentum in the US has boosted investor confidence, sparking fresh enthusiasm for digital assets across the board. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed three cryptocurrency-related bills, sending one directly to President Donald Trump and the other two to the Senate. These moves are part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to establish the US as the “crypto capital of the world” during what the president calls “crypto week .” The key bill heading to Trump, the GENIUS Act , introduces initial regulations and consumer protections for stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar. It passed the House with bipartisan support and aims to balance innovation with safeguarding consumers in the evolving payments landscape. Another bill, which passed by a narrower margin, seeks to clarify how different types of digital assets are regulated, distinguishing commodities, overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, from securities, regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The legislation now moves to the Senate for further consideration. A third bill, passed narrowly, would prohibit the US from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), essentially banning government-backed digital cash. This bill also awaits Senate review. Trump Family’s Crypto Holdings Spark Conflict of Interest Concerns Trump’s family holds significant interests in crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, raising concerns over conflicts of interest and potential corruption. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

Another bill, which passed by a narrower margin, seeks to clarify how different types of digital assets are regulated, distinguishing commodities, overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, from securities, regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The legislation now moves to the Senate for further consideration. A third bill, passed narrowly, would prohibit the US from issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC), essentially banning government-backed digital cash. This bill also awaits Senate review. Trump Family’s Crypto Holdings Spark Conflict of Interest Concerns Trump’s family holds significant interests in crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, raising concerns over conflicts of interest and potential corruption. According to financial disclosures released last Friday, the former president pulled in $58 million from crypto ventures in 2024, primarily through WLFI token sales. That total trailed only his hospitality income and is expected to climb further in 2025 with an anticipated $390 million token sale and gains from his meme coin, launched in January. His involvement in Bitcoin mining, tokenized assets, and digital ETFs is raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

2025-07-18 06:43:52+00:00,The SEC is exploring an innovation exemption to promote asset tokenization.,"The Securities and Exchange Commission Chair, Paul Atkins, said they are considering a regulatory exception to encourage tokenization. He told reporters, “Staff is considering what other changes may be appropriate to incentivize tokenization within our regulatory framework, including an innovation exception.” His remarks came shortly after the House passed the GENIUS Act—a key stablecoin bill—on Thursday. Atkins welcomed the move, emphasizing the SEC’s commitment to offering clearer guidance for the digital asset industry. The SEC chair claimed that assets will eventually be tokenized According to Atkins, they are exploring rule alterations to allow new trading methods and more targeted exemptions to support the development of a broader tokenized securities infrastructure. Several financial institutions have already shown interest in tokenizing major US stocks, and some have even hinted at developing tokenized products of private firms. While the future remains uncertain, Atkins argued that shifting assets onto blockchain rails is clearly inevitable, adding, “So if it can be tokenized, it will be tokenized.” He also talked about the recently approved stablecoin bill, hailing it as a “historic step” toward establishing the US as the global leader in crypto. He stated that he’s looking forward to seeing the market leverage the legislation provides while maintaining robust risk standards. Other backers of the bill have claimed it could enable quicker, lower-cost payments and bring credibility to the $265 billion stablecoin industry, which Citigroup analysts estimate could balloon to $3.7 trillion by 2030. Still, some Democrats like Senator Elizabeth Warren argue the legislation doesn’t go far enough in shielding consumers. House Democrats who opposed the bill cited concerns over President Trump’s involvement with crypto assets. According to Blomberg, Trump and his family have received $620 million from their crypto ventures, including the World Liberty Financial project, the TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins, and a 20% stake in American Bitcoin. The bill, however, had over 100 democrats vote in favor of it. Emilie Choi, Coinbase’s President, even described it as a giant milestone to have massive bipartisan support to advance stablecoins and market structure. The legislation stipulates that firms will hold equivalent dollar reserves in short-term government bonds or similar assets subject to state or federal oversight. It is set to reach Trump’s desk before the end of the week, where he is expected to sign it into law. Atkins had stated he would remove some of Gensler’s policies Paul Atkins has charted a distinctly different course on crypto from his predecessor, Gary Gensler, who critics say tried to govern the sector through enforcement. Atkins has previously expressed his intention to unwind key Gensler-era policies, including the rule allowing brokers to act as digital asset custodians. In May, he said the agency will make it easier to register crypto assets by clarifying securities rules. On custody, he said registrants should have more choices for managing and storing customer assets. He signaled the commission would reexamine and define the criteria for “qualified custodians,” while also granting exemptions from current custody requirements to align with common practices in the industry. Atkins also said the framework governing special-purpose broker-dealers is due for an overhaul. He supports allowing registered firms to trade a broader mix of securities and non-securities assets on their platforms. He also emphasized that the agency should work on replacing the existing rules with ones that could last for years.

Over the past week, XRP has surged more than 40%, breaking out of a large symmetrical triangle it had been forming since the start of the year. The breakout began around July 9, with strong momentum continuing into the following days. XRP smashed through the $3 resistance level, a price point that had acted as both support and resistance multiple times this year. Why $3 Was So Important According to analyst Lark Davis, the $3 level was important. In January and March, it had acted as a major barrier, first as support, then resistance. Now that XRP has broken above it, the big question is: can it stay there? If it does, analysts believe XRP could push toward $4.10 or even $4.50 based on technical projections. This target is based on the height of the triangle pattern that XRP just broke out of. All Eyes on the Retest Short term, what happens next will likely depend on how XRP behaves around the $3 mark. If the price retests $3 and holds, it could be a strong signal for another leg up. If it drops below that level again, XRP might trade sideways for a bit between $2.60 and $3. How High Can XRP Go This Year? A Fibonacci extension points to a possible price of $4.68. And if Bitcoin continues its own bullish trend toward $150K, XRP might even stretch to $5 or more this year. Options markets also show that traders are betting on more upside. There’s nearly a 20% chance XRP hits $4.50 by September, according to data from recent call options.

2025-07-18 07:00:37+00:00,XRP MVRV Ratio Flashes Signal That Last Led To 630% Surge,"An analyst has pointed out that the XRP Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio has just formed a crossover that proved to be highly bullish the last time it appeared. XRP MVRV Ratio Has Broken Above Its 200-Day MA In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a crossover that has recently occurred in the MVRV Ratio of XRP. The “MVRV Ratio” is a popular on-chain indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the asset’s Market Cap and Realized Cap. The Realized Cap here refers to a capitalization model that calculates the cryptocurrency’s total value by assuming that the value of each coin in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. This is unlike the Market Cap, which simply takes the current spot price as the same one value for all coins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Influx Of New Capital: First-Time Buyers Add 140,000 BTC The last transfer of any token is likely to represent the last time it changed hands, so the price at its time can be denoted as its current cost basis. As such, the Realized Cap represents the sum of the cost basis of the entire circulating supply. One way to interpret the model is as a measure of the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have stored in the cryptocurrency. The Market Cap, on the other hand, signifies the value that the holders are carrying in the present. When the value of the MVRV Ratio is more than 1, it means the Market Cap is greater than the Realized Cap. In other words, the investors are holding more than they put in. On the other hand, the metric being under this threshold suggests the overall network is underwater. Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez that shows the trend in the XRP MVRV Ratio, as well as its 200-day moving average (MA), over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP MVRV Ratio has seen a sharp surge recently as the asset’s breakout has occurred. With this uptrend, the indicator has managed to break past its 200-day MA. In the chart, the analyst has highlighted the last time that the cryptocurrency’s MVRV Ratio and its 200-day MA showed this type of crossover. What followed back then was a significant bull run in which the coin managed to rise by around 630%. Related Reading: XRP Close Above This Level Could Send Price To $4.80, Analyst Says Given this precedence, it now remains to be seen whether the latest crossover will also prove to be a golden one for XRP.

Yet, beneath the surface of this technological marvel lies a significant concern that resonates deeply within the cryptocurrency community: AI privacy . Just as blockchain technology champions decentralization and user control over data, the centralized nature of many AI models raises red flags regarding data handling. As individuals, businesses, and even governments enthusiastically embrace the seemingly magical capabilities of AI, a critical question consistently emerges: How can we truly safeguard our sensitive information? The Growing AI Privacy Challenge Tech behemoths like OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and Google are quietly, yet consistently, collecting and retaining vast amounts of user data. This practice is often justified for model improvement or security monitoring. However, even in enterprise environments, where companies typically assume their information is protected, this data collection can occur without explicit, transparent consent. For industries under strict regulatory scrutiny, such as healthcare, finance, and government, this ambiguous data landscape is not just a concern; it’s a potential deal-breaker. Fears about the destination of data, its accessibility, and its potential misuse are demonstrably slowing the broader AI adoption in these critical sectors. The very promise of AI is hindered by a fundamental lack of trust in its underlying data infrastructure. Introducing Confident Security: The Signal for AI Amidst these growing concerns, a San Francisco-based startup, Confident Security , has emerged from stealth with a powerful vision: to become “the Signal for AI.” This ambitious goal positions them as a beacon of trust and privacy in the burgeoning AI ecosystem. The company recently announced a significant milestone, securing a substantial $4.2 million in seed funding. This investment, exclusively learned by Bitcoin World, comes from prominent venture capital firms including Decibel, South Park Commons, Ex Ante, and Swyx, underscoring the market’s urgent need for robust AI privacy solutions. How CONFSEC Delivers End-to-End Encryption Confident Security’s flagship product, CONFSEC, is engineered to provide an unparalleled level of data protection. At its core, CONFSEC is an end-to-end encryption tool designed to encapsulate foundational AI models. This innovative wrapper ensures that all prompts and associated metadata remain entirely private, guaranteeing that they cannot be stored, viewed, or utilized for AI training purposes by the model provider or any third party. This commitment to privacy addresses the core anxiety of AI users. Jonathan Mortensen, founder and CEO of Confident Security, articulated the company’s philosophy to Bitcoin World, stating, “The second that you give up your data to someone else, you’ve essentially reduced your privacy. And our product’s goal is to remove that trade-off.” This statement perfectly encapsulates the mission: to empower AI users with the confidence that their data remains their own. CONFSEC’s operational framework is ingeniously modeled after Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC) architecture, which Mortensen praises as “10x better than anything out there in terms of guaranteeing that Apple cannot see your data” during secure cloud-based AI tasks. This inspiration highlights a commitment to best-in-class privacy standards. The system operates through a sophisticated, multi-layered process: Data Anonymization: Initially, data is anonymized through encryption and routed via trusted services like Cloudflare or Fastly. This crucial first step ensures that servers never gain visibility into the original source or content of the data, immediately establishing a layer of anonymity. Advanced Conditional Decryption: Next, CONFSEC employs advanced encryption techniques that permit decryption only under highly restrictive, predefined conditions. Mortensen elaborated on this, explaining, “So you can say you’re only allowed to decrypt this if you are not going to log the data, and you’re not going to use it for training, and you’re not going to let anyone see it.” This granular control over data access is revolutionary. Transparent Verification: Finally, the software responsible for AI inference is publicly logged and made open for review. This transparency allows independent experts to verify and confirm that the system’s privacy guarantees are rigorously upheld, fostering trust through auditable processes.

MICROSOFT IS INTERESTED IN USING RIPPLE’S INTERLEDGER PROTOCOL Documented. pic.twitter.com/YvSmeppjNe — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) July 16, 2025 Microsoft’s Broader Blockchain Strategy The attached document shows that Microsoft has been integrating blockchain technologies into its cloud platform Azure, with a focus on providing enterprise solutions. According to the document, Microsoft partnered with ConsenSys to develop applications using Ethereum’s blockchain, enabling companies to execute smart contracts, track transactions, and update contracts efficiently. The company reportedly claimed that its blockchain-based services would not be dependent on Bitcoin and that Ethereum-based systems could offer transaction speeds up to 40 times faster than Bitcoin-based blockchains. Ripple’s Role Through Interledger Protocol The document quoted by SMQKE explicitly states that Microsoft “recently expressed interest in adding new functionalities to its blockchain toolkit through Ripple’s Interledger Protocol.” This indicates Microsoft’s recognition of ILP’s capabilities to facilitate interoperability across different payment ledgers. The Interledger Protocol, created by Ripple, is described as a free, open-source, and neutral web protocol that enables different ledgers to interact seamlessly. The document also refers to Ripple as one of the top-funded FinTech startups, underlining its prominence in the development of cross-border payment solutions .

The documentation cited shows that Microsoft viewed ILP as a valuable component to enhance its toolkit, which already included Ethereum-based solutions and integrations on Azure. Given Ripple’s focus on interoperability and efficient cross-ledger transfers , Microsoft’s documented interest suggests a potential acknowledgment of ILP’s suitability for enterprise-grade blockchain infrastructure. SMQKE’s post drew attention to a verifiable instance where Microsoft’s blockchain strategy intersects with Ripple’s innovations, specifically the Interledger Protocol. The excerpt he shared provides written evidence that Microsoft was exploring the integration of ILP to improve its blockchain offerings.

In a new CNBC Television interview, the investor says Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA) will likely each hit $5 trillion market caps by the end of next year as artificial intelligence (AI) advances. “We’re seeing the use cases when it comes to AI exploding and that’s bullish for software and the hyperscalers led by, of course, Redmond and [CEO Satya] Nadella in terms of everything that Microsoft [is doing] – not just $4 trillion, we think that could be a $5 trillion market cap along with Nvidia in the next 18 months.” Microsoft has a market cap of $3.8 trillion and is trading for $511 per share at time of writing. Meanwhile, Nvidia is trading for $173 per share at time of writing and has a market cap of $4.2 trillion. Ives also believes that several software companies may have explosive breakouts in the coming months. “Software has underperformed. But now it’s not just Palantir, which obviously is our top one in terms of AI revolution. MongoDB, Snowflake, I think IBM is seeing a massive renaissance of growth when it comes to what we’re seeing on AI monetization… I think software, and even cybersecurity, is what I believe could be a significant outperformer across all of the tech sector in the second half of the year.” Palantir (PLTR) is trading for $153 per share at time of writing, while MongoDB (MDB) is trading for $218 per share.

2025-07-18 07:04:42+00:00,American Businessman Dave Portnoy Regrets Selling XRP: ‘I Would’ve Made Millions’,"Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is expressing regret after selling most of his XRP holdings just weeks before the cryptocurrency hit new year-to-date highs on Thursday. Key Takeaways: Dave Portnoy regrets selling most of his XRP early, missing out on millions. XRP’s recent rally triggered $68 million in short position liquidations amid a broader crypto market surge. The crypto market rally follows key US legislative wins. In a video posted to X , Portnoy said, “I would’ve made millions, and I want to cry. I don’t own it anymore, even though I was the leader of the XRP army.” XRP recently broke through its yearly high of $3.29 and surged to $3.60, marking a 19.61% gain in the past 24 hours, according to data from Nansen. Portnoy Sold XRP at $2.40 After Warning About Circle Competition Portnoy revealed he sold XRP when the price reached $2.40, influenced by someone who warned him about competition from stablecoin issuer Circle. Ripple Labs, the company behind XRP, applied for a national bank charter in the US on July 2, just two days after Circle filed for the same. At the Consensus 2025 conference, Portnoy admitted he lacked a strong conviction in XRP, purchasing it out of fear of missing out (FOMO), hoping it might become the next Bitcoin.

The surge is part of a broader crypto market upswing that started on July 9, following Bitcoin’s climb past $112,000, its highest since May. Amid strong gains in major cryptocurrencies, the total crypto market cap is rapidly approaching the $4 trillion mark . The rally coincided with the recent legislative momentum in the US, which has boosted investor confidence, sparking fresh enthusiasm for digital assets across the board. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed three cryptocurrency-related bills, sending one directly to President Donald Trump and the other two to the Senate. These moves are part of the Trump administration’s broader effort to establish the US as the “crypto capital of the world” during what the president calls “crypto week .” XRP Perpetual Futures Open Interest Hits Record $8.8B XRP saw a spike in notional open interest for its perpetual futures contracts on Wednesday. Notional open interest, the total value of leveraged positions held by traders, climbed to an all-time high of $8.8 billion on Wednesday, according to CoinGlass. The figure corresponds to nearly 2.9 billion XRP in open contracts. The previous record for XRP notional open interest stood at $8.3 billion, which was hit in late January before the start of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Across most venues, XRP’s funding rate was positive and climbing, signaling a market where longs are willing to pay shorts to maintain positions, a classic indicator of bullish sentiment. As reported, the number of wallets holding at least 1 million XRP tokens has also surged to an all-time high .

The Minneapolis-based online performance marketing company has emerged as the world’s largest corporate holder of Ethereum, surpassing the Ethereum Foundation with approximately 353,000 ETH, worth over $1.2 billion. SharpLink is Accumulating Aggressively The aggressive accumulation strategy began in late May following a $425 million private placement led by Consensys . Since then, SharpLink’s stock (SBET) has risen 29% amid the buying spree. At the time of writing, the stock is trading at $36.40 per share. The stock has increased roughly sixfold since the ETH treasury pivot several weeks ago. Source: Yahoo Finance The company has allocated 99.7% of its ETH holdings to staking protocols, generating approximately 415 ETH in rewards since June while supporting Ethereum network security. This dual-purpose strategy allows SharpLink to earn additional yield while participating in proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who chairs SharpLink’s board and leads Consensys, described the firm’s approach as a public-market proxy for Ethereum exposure similar to MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. The company’s positioning capitalizes on Ethereum’s programmable nature and yield-generating capabilities, which extend beyond simple price appreciation. Corporate Treasury Revolution Follows MicroStrategy Bitcoin Playbook SharpLink’s Ethereum accumulation follows the model pioneered by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which has amassed $67 billion in Bitcoin since 2020. The strategy involves converting traditional cash reserves into cryptocurrency holdings to serve as the primary treasury reserve asset. The company described Ethereum as “ the base layer of the future global economy ” while committing to long-term holding and staking strategies. The transformation began after SharpLink raised approximately $425 million through private placement and at-the-market equity sales. Proceeds were earmarked explicitly for Ethereum purchases rather than traditional business expansion, establishing ETH as the company’s primary reserve asset. According Lookonchain, SharpLink has bought another 20,279 Ethereum (ETH) on Thursday, worth $68.38 million. #SharpLink #EthereumStrategy #ETH https://t.co/mrCYHV8jWc — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 17, 2025 One notable transaction involved SharpLink purchasing 10,000 ETH directly from the Ethereum Foundation for $25.7 million, executed through the Foundation’s multisig wallet. The direct purchase approach bypassed traditional exchanges and OTC desks. Between July 7 and July 18, SharpLink purchased 134,204 ETH at an average price of $2,970, totaling $398.66 million in investments. The company has consistently acquired tens of millions of dollars worth of ETH daily, according to Lubin’s statements to CNBC . Institutional Ethereum Adoption Accelerates Across Multiple Sectors The corporate Ethereum adoption trend extends beyond SharpLink to multiple publicly traded companies seeking alternatives to traditional cash management. For instance, Bit Digital completed its transformation into an Ethereum treasury company by selling 280 BTC and deploying $172 million to accumulate over 100,000 ETH. Similarly, GameSquare Holdings announced a $100 million ETH treasury allocation through a phased investment strategy targeting yields of 8-14%, which is significantly higher than the standard ETH staking returns of 3-4%.

By offloading routine, time-consuming, or complex digital tasks, it frees up users to focus on higher-level, creative, and strategic work. This shift from passive interaction (asking questions) to active task execution (performing actions) marks a pivotal moment in AI development. The agent is rolling out to OpenAI’s Pro, Plus, and Team plan subscribers. Activating this powerful tool is straightforward: simply select ‘agent mode’ from ChatGPT’s dropdown menu of tools. This ease of access ensures that a broad base of users can immediately begin to experience the benefits of this advanced AI agent . Connecting Your World: Enhanced Capabilities and Integrations What truly sets the new ChatGPT agent apart are its expanded connectivity options. OpenAI has equipped it with ‘ChatGPT connectors,’ allowing seamless integration with popular applications. This means the agent can access relevant information from your personal and professional digital ecosystem: Gmail Integration: Imagine the agent sifting through your emails to find specific information for a report or drafting replies based on context. GitHub Access: For developers, the ability to connect to GitHub means the agent can potentially assist with code reviews, repository management, or even debugging by accessing your projects. Furthermore, the ChatGPT agent has access to a terminal and can utilize APIs to interact with a broader range of applications. This level of access signifies a powerful leap, moving beyond mere information retrieval to direct, actionable engagement with diverse software environments. This capability is crucial for unlocking truly transformative automation workflows. Benchmarking Excellence: A Leap in Automation Performance OpenAI asserts that the model underpinning the ChatGPT agent delivers state-of-the-art performance across several critical benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities compared to previous iterations and competitors. This isn’t just incremental improvement; it represents a significant jump in AI’s ability to tackle complex, multi-faceted problems. Consider the following performance metrics: Benchmark Test ChatGPT Agent (with tools) OpenAI’s o3/o4-mini (previous) Humanity’s Last Exam (pass@1) 41.6% ~20% (roughly double) FrontierMath (with tools) 27.4% 6.3% The ‘Humanity’s Last Exam’ is a notoriously difficult test comprising thousands of questions across over a hundred subjects. The ChatGPT agent ‘s score of 41.6% (pass@1) is roughly double what OpenAI’s o3 and o4-mini models achieved, highlig"

2025-07-18 07:42:17+00:00,Donald Trump’s New  Executive Order Could Add Crypto to 401(k) Retirement Accounts,"The post Donald Trump’s New Executive Order Could Add Crypto to 401(k) Retirement Accounts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order that could open U.S. retirement plans, known as 401(k)s, to cryptocurrency and other alternative assets. The move could drastically change how nearly $9 trillion in retirement savings are managed and allocated. A New Direction for 401(k) Investments According to a Financial Times report , the executive order may be signed as early as this week. It would direct Washington regulators to explore pathways for allowing 401(k) accounts to include crypto assets, metals, infrastructure funds, and even private equity and loans. Traditionally, these retirement accounts have been limited to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. This plan builds on momentum gained earlier this year, when the Department of Labor under Trump’s influence reversed Biden-era guidance that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in retirement plans. Financial giant Fidelity also introduced a new retirement account in April that includes crypto options, further hinting at institutional appetite for such changes. Official Yet Unconfirmed While the executive order seems imminent, Trump’s camp has emphasized that nothing is official yet. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the media that any decision must come directly from Trump himself. However, he reiterated the president’s commitment to enhancing financial opportunities for everyday Americans. Big Institutions Preparing Major financial firms are already preparing for this potential shift. Companies like Blackstone, BlackRock, and Apollo are reportedly working on private market offerings tailored for retirement investors. Partnerships with major 401(k) providers such as Vanguard and Empower are also underway, setting the stage for rapid adoption if the order goes through. With over $8.9 trillion held in U.S. retirement accounts, even a small percentage allocated to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum would significantly boost market liquidity and long-term price stability. Global Impact If finalized, the U.S. wouldn’t be alone in this move. Countries like Japan and the UK have already begun considering or allocating small portions of pension funds to Bitcoin. This global trend shows increasing comfort with crypto as a long-term investment vehicle. For now, all eyes are on Trump. If the order is signed, it could mark a major milestone in crypto adoption, one that integrates digital assets into the heart of American financial planning. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-18 07:52:31+00:00,CoinFutures Review: New High Leverage Trading Platform,"CoinFutures is a crypto futures trading platform with a gamified approach to crypto futures trading. Developed by the makers of CoinPoker, the platform has generated quite a bit of buzz within the cryptocurrency community thanks to its leveraged trading capabilities without asking for any KYC details. The purpose of this article is to highlight the key features of CoinFutures and how it stacks up against the needs of the modern trader who has become ever more inclined to jump into crypto during the current bull cycle. What is CoinFutures? The official website gives a small and clear definition of the platform as a system where users can earn based on their correct price prediction of their favorite assets. Investors can either give a “short” prediction, believing that the asset’s value will drop, or go “long” if they believe the asset could surge in the long term. Features like “cash out before the bust” are highlights of this platform, essentially allowing investors to withdraw before the market turns negative. The platform, powered by AI-driven smart algorithms, mirrors current volatile macroeconomic conditions to offer users a trade-like experience without the complexities of real trading. In simple terms, CoinFutures offers a gamified approach to crypto trading without involving complexities such as wallets or exchanges. How One Can Trade Crypto Futures on CoinFutures? Regardless of how easy CoinFutures makes the prospect of trading crypto futures sound, there are some innate complexities present. That said, the website has provided instructions (in clear terms, no less) on how the entire system works. Picking a Cryptocurrency CoinFutures instructs that users must first pick a cryptocurrency. The options available are many, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the top two choices. For now, however, the options are limited, with the only other assets including Dogecoin, Tron, and Litecoin. But CoinFutures promises that more will be added in the future. Picking an asset will reveal the crypto’s price charts, which will be instrumental in deciding the options in the next step. Predicting an Asset’s Price Action Investors (or in this case, players) will then have to predict whether the price of an asset will go up or down. The options available are simple, with little up and down buttons provided to simplify the process. Selecting the Price and Multiplier Investors must then select the price point the asset is likely to hit. Manual inputs are available, but if the predictions are general, a simple scroll option lets investors add or subtract the price. Choosing a multiplier is also an option. It is said to amplify the prediction. Similar to standard leveraged trading, this protocol involves high risk and high rewards. Placing the Prediction and Cashing Out After placing the prediction, investors can look at the price chart to keep tabs on whether their prediction is likely to pan out. Because CoinFutures is flexible, it also allows investors to cash out quickly if the market is turning against them or going “bust”. What Factors Make CoinFutures a Suitable Platform? CoinFutures offers a unique approach to crypto futures trading. It isn’t complex and relies on gamification, going as far as portraying investors as “players” and the entire ecosystem as betting. This trait alone makes it fit for those who think of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem as akin to a game. Secondly, the price chart shows simulated real crypto volatility, while also allowing investors to amplify their bets with up to a 1000x multiplier. This strategy lets players tap into the volatile markets and leverage the high-risk, high-reward paradigm to earn large returns. Despite the gamified approach, CoinFutures’ crypto futures trading style isn’t bereft of strategic depth. Players abreast of market conditions could gain an edge when predicting. While veteran crypto enthusiasts can stick to manual mode, less confident players wanting to manage risks can opt for auto-mode instead. This mode lets players set a stop-loss and take-profit level. All of these features wouldn’t be as effective without a strong user interface, which CoinFutures provides. It has the same CoinPoker-esque approach to design: simple, unique, and yet stylish. All the options are clearly provided, and the additional data about other players’ bets adds another layer to the strategic element of this “trading game.” For those who prefer anonymity, CoinFutures’ no-KYC approach is also an aspect worth highlighting. Payment Options Available on CoinFutures Although CoinFutures revels in being a crypto-centric ecosystem, the payment options available make it accessible to all.

Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets, is gaining renewed traction as institutional adoption expands and its prolonged legal standoff nears resolution. Since President Trump returned to office, XRP has seen a surge in on-chain activity, bullish investor sentiment, and increasing chatter around a possible XRP ETF approval. In July 2025, XRP marked a new all-time high of $3.66 , coinciding with the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF , which is a milestone that further fueled optimism. With more asset managers eyeing approval and institutional capital flowing in, investors are now closely watching where XRP could head next in this evolving market landscape. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025.

In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half’s last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94 triggered by a ceasefire news between the US, Israel, and Iran. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple’s CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case . Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has also officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into XRP also increased. The ongoing July is filled with positive sentiment that continues to strengthen the XRP price. The investors have been engaged in a “buy-the-dip” mindset, and investor panic appeared to subside. In July, several more factors joined, like Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , and Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. More developments that are supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment are due to the third week of July’s events, for instance, Ripple partners with Ctrl Alt and Dubai Land Department for tokenized real estate on XRP Ledger, which has boosted its utility. The top two major highlights of July is that ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF on July 18; as a result, the ",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-prediction/xrp-ripple-price-prediction/,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|ICO|ALTCOIN|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|EXCHANGE,Cryptocurrency Price Prediction|Price Prediction|Ripple (XRP),BTC,"Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2025, 2026-2030: Will XRP Reach $5?.

This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030. Table of contents CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 XRP Price Today XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Ripple XRP Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 XRP Price Prediction 2026 Ripple Price Prediction 2027 XRP Price Prediction 2028 XRP Price Prediction 2029 XRP Price Prediction 2030 Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Market Analysis Institutional XRP Price Targets for 2025 FAQs CoinPedia’s Ripple (XRP) Price Prediction 2025 With regulatory clarity from the SEC case and Ripple accelerating its expansion, we at CoinPedia are optimistic about the XRP forecast. We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $ 3.47423082 10.06% Market cap $ 205,612,588,271.99 Circulating Supply 59,182,189,917.00 Trading Volume $ 22,644,970,367.3233 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half’s last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton’s XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94 triggered by a ceasefire news between the US, Israel, and Iran. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple’s CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case . Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has also officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, called Ripple’s move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into XRP also increased. The ongoing July is filled with positive sentiment that continues to strengthen the XRP price. The investors have been engaged in a “buy-the-dip” mindset, and investor panic appeared to subside. In July, several more factors joined, like Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , and Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. More developments that are supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment are due to the third week of July’s events, for instance, Ripple partners with Ctrl Alt and Dubai Land Department for tokenized real estate on XRP Ledger, which has boosted its utility. The top two major highlights of July is that ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF on July 18; as a result, the"
2025-07-18 08:00:06+00:00,2025 Crypto Thefts Spike: Stolen Funds Hit $2.7 Billion In H1– Report,"As the market soars with bullish momentum, crypto theft has also seen a record-breaking performance during the first half of this year. A recent report revealed that stolen funds from services so far have surpassed the numbers from previous years. Related Reading: Crypto Relief: House Advances GENIUS, CLARITY, Anti-CBDC Bills After Narrow Vote Stolen Crypto Service Funds Hit $2B In 6 months On Thursday, Chainalysis shared its “2025 Crypto Crime Mid-Year Update,” revealing that digital assets theft this year has been “more devastating” than the entirety of 2024, with over $2.7 billion worth of funds stolen from crypto services so far. The report noted that, by the end of June, more value had been stolen year-to-date (YTD) than during the same period in 2022, the previous worst year on record, suggesting that theft from crypto services could potentially increase another 60% by year’s end. 2025’s YTD activity shows a significantly steeper trajectory into the end of the first half than any previous year, with an alarming velocity and consistency. 2022 required 214 days to hit the $2 billion mark in value stolen from services, while 2025 reached comparable theft volumes in 142 days. Additionally, 2025 is 17.27% worse than 2022 during the same six-month period, while 2023 and 2024 saw more moderate and steady accumulation patterns. The surge in the cumulative trend value from crypto services theft “paints a stark picture of 2025’s escalating threat environment.” According to the report, “If this trend continues, we could see 2025 end with more than $4.3 billion stolen from services alone.” However, it’s worth noting that the North Korean-linked $1.5 billion hack of Bybit accounts for most of the service losses. The massive breach, which is the largest crypto hack in history, signals a “broader pattern of North Korean cryptocurrency operations, which have become increasingly central to the regime’s sanctions evasion strategies.” Last year, known North Korean-related losses reached their highest number, with the value reaching $1.3 billion. Nonetheless, Bybit’s February hack surpassed it, making 2025 the worst year to date. Personal Wallet Attacks Surge Amid the shifting landscape, the report highlights that the surge in crypto thefts represents an immediate threat to participants. Notably, attackers are increasingly targeting individual users, as personal wallet incidents represent a growing share of total ecosystem theft. YTD, these compromises account for 23.35% of all stolen funds activities in 2025, with Bitcoin (BTC) theft accounting for a substantial share of stolen value. Chainalysis also found that the average loss from compromised personal BTC wallets has increased, suggesting a deliberate target on higher-value individual holdings. Moreover, the number of individual victims on non-Bitcoin and non-EVM chains, like Solana, is increasing. This suggests that Bitcoin holders experience larger losses in terms of value taken, despite being less likely to fall victim to targeted theft. Related Reading: SUI Eyes 140% Move As Price Reclaims $4 – New ATH Imminent? Within the personal wallet incidents, a violent subsection has also seen a dramatic surge this year, showing a correlation with BTC price movements and suggesting opportunistic targeting during high-value periods. The forward-looking implication is that, if the value of native assets increases, the value compromised from personal wallets will also likely rise. Per the report, theft using physical violence or coercion against individuals, also known as “wrench attacks,” could potentially hit twice the number of 2021, the next highest year on record.

2025-07-18 08:06:50+00:00,This $0.03 DeFi token is 80% sold as BTC ETF inflows hit $2.72B—20x gains ahead?,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is more than just a presale buzzword. It is building a decentralized lending protocol with a hybrid infrastructure that aims to fix many of the pain points that exist in traditional and DeFi borrowing. Instead of offering a rigid, one-size-fits-all experience, the project introduces a two-pronged lending model and offers full borrower flexibility—something DeFi users have been waiting for. As the world of passive crypto income grows more competitive, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s real innovation lies in how it handles capital. BTC inflow push Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs in the U.S. recorded a record-breaking $2.72 billion in net inflows over two days, with $1.17B on July 16 and $1.03B on July 17, 2025, marking the strongest two-day run since their January 2024 launch. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin (BTC) Trust (IBIT) led with $445.47M daily inflows, reaching $80B in assets under management, while Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK’s ARKB added $324.34M and $268.7M, respectively. Institutional demand outpaced new BTC issuance by 22:1, with 364K daily transactions and $61.43B in on-chain volume. BTC’s price held at $121,209, with technicals targeting $130K. The ETF surge boosts crypto sentiment, potentially lifting ETH (+5%), XRP (+3%), and SOL, as institutional capital flows in. Meme coins like SHIB may see less interest, but regulatory tailwinds from U.S. crypto-friendly policies could drive altcoin rallies if inflows persist. Unmatched borrower flexibility meets real yield At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a borrowing engine that offers fully overcollateralized loans, open-ended repayment options, and flexible risk exposure. Borrowers don’t need to worry about strict due dates or rigid repayment plans. Everything is non-custodial and built around overcollateralization. This means users can lock in value without having to liquidate their long-term holdings, while still accessing immediate liquidity. For example, a user deposits 1,000 LINK (valued around $18,000) into the platform. With a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 60%, they can borrow $10,800 in USDT instantly, while maintaining full exposure to their LINK position. If LINK appreciates during the loan period, the user benefits from the price gain. Repayment can happen at any time, and once complete, the collateral is unlocked with no penalties. This kind of freedom, paired with smart risk parameters, sets a new standard in DeFi lending. Where other platforms separate flexibility and safety, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings both together through its dual lending structure. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model serves blue-chip assets like ETH, BTC, and DAI, enabling users to deposit and earn variable yields via smart contract pools. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system targets riskier or niche assets, giving users the power to negotiate interest rates, durations, and collateral terms for tokens like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE. By allowing users to borrow against well-known tokens or negotiate custom loans on lesser-known assets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineering a complete, flexible DeFi experience. This hybrid model doesn’t just widen the user base—it increases long-term engagement across multiple token classes. Presale momentum builds as 20x forecasts surface Phase 5 of the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is nearly complete, with 80% of tokens already sold. The current price is still holding at $0.03—but not for long. The next phase will raise the price to $0.035, a 20% gain for those who act now. So far, the protocol has raised $12.5 million from over 13,500 holders, many of whom joined during earlier stages. Buyers from Phase 1 entered at just $0.010 and are already sitting on a 300% paper gain. With a confirmed listing price of $0.06, even new Phase 5 participants are looking at a guaranteed 2X gain. But projections go much further. Market strategists who called DOT’s early run are now circling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) with estimates of up to 20x by 2026, driven by its real utility, not hype. That confidence is also being reinforced by security measures. The project has already undergone a full audit from CertiK, earning a 95/100 Token Scan Score and a 77.5 Skynet rating. A $50,000 Bug Bounty program is now active, covering all vulnerability tiers with rewards for those helping improve system resilience. This is a signal that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just rushing to market—it’s building carefully for the long haul. To energize its growing community, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also hosting a $100,000 giveaway , adding extra incentive for long-term believers. All of this comes as the platform prepares for the release of its beta version, with core lending functionality and smart contract interactions set to go live around the time of exchange listings.

Semler Scientific Buys 210 Bitcoin The California-headquartered company continues to grow its exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market cap. According to the filing, Semler Scientific purchased 210 BTC between July 3 and July 16, spending $25 million at an average cost of $118,974 per BTC. At current market prices, the company’s total BTC holdings are valued at nearly $570 million. Meanwhile, the average acquisition cost of its Bitcoin stack stands at approximately $93,890 per BTC, with a cumulative investment of $455 million. It is worth highlighting that Semler Scientific’s latest purchase has pushed the company to the 14th position on the list of publicly traded firms with the largest BTC treasuries. This move reflects its growing commitment to Bitcoin as part of its corporate strategy. According to data from CoinGecko, Michael Saylor’s Strategy – formerly known as MicroStrategy – continues to be the leading publicly-traded firm with the largest Bitcoin holdings, effectively controlling almost 3% of the total BTC circulating supply. Other notable companies in the list include Marathon Digital Holdings, Metaplanet, Galaxy Digital Holdings, Tesla, and Coinbase Global. Semler Scientific is followed by GameStop which holds a total of 4,710 BTC in its treasury. In its regulatory filing, Semler Scientific reported a Year-to-Date (YTD) Bitcoin Yield of 30.3%. To explain, Bitcoin Yield is a key performance indicator for investors that reflects the growth of BTC per share. Interestingly, the company’s recent Bitcoin acquisitions have been funded largely through proceeds from an at-the-market (ATM) equity offering. Since April 2025, this offering has raised $175 million. However, Semler Scientific’s stock performance in 2025 has been underwhelming. According to Yahoo! Finance, its share price has dropped roughly 34.4% over the past six months – from $65.98 on January 21 to $42.25 at the time of writing. Companies Accumulate BTC Despite Fresh ATH Despite Bitcoin’s historic bull run and repeated all-time highs (ATHs), corporate demand remains strong. Recently, Michael Saylor hinted that Strategy may be preparing to increase its BTC reserves once again. Japanese firm Metaplanet also continues to ramp up its BTC purchases. Most recently, the firm acquired another 800 BTC, increasing its total holdings to 15,500 BTC. Meanwhile, corporate digital asset accumulation isn’t limited to BTC.

2025-07-18 08:33:41+00:00,SharpLink unlocks $6B in new capital to supercharge Ethereum buys,"SharpLink has increased its share offering capacity from $1 billion to $6 billion to potentially fund more of its aggressive Ethereum (ETH) buys. In its updated prospectus filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on July 18, the company disclosed amendments to its previous May 30 registration. The latest filing raises the total amount of common stock that the company may sell under its at-the-market (ATM) program to $6 billion, up from the initial $1 billion. So far, the Joseph Lubin-backed firm has already sold approximately $720 million worth of shares under the earlier prospectus and may now offer up to $5 billion more under the amended agreement. The filing also includes an amendment to the company’s sales agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners, allowing for forward sales of its common stock. Compensation terms have been revised accordingly, with A.G.P. entitled to a 2.5% commission on the first $1 billion in sales, 2% on subsequent sales, and 4% for any forward transactions. According to the prospectus, SharpLink intends to allocate most of the proceeds to acquiring Ether (ETH), while also reserving some capital for working capital, general corporate purposes, and operational expenses. Although many in the crypto space view this as a bullish move for both the company and the world’s largest altcoin, shareholders have yet to reflect that optimism. SharpLink’s shares closed at $36.40 on July 17 before falling 4.95% to $34.60 in after-hours trading. That could change soon, however, given Ethereum’s strong performance over the past week, with the asset climbing more than 20% and breaking past key resistance levels. SharpLink could target 1% ETH supply SharpLink’s expanded fundraising push is expected to supercharge its Ethereum-focused treasury strategy. By significantly increasing the share sale limit, the company now has more headroom to purchase larger volumes of ETH in the coming months, with its treasury strategy seemingly aligned toward a long-term target of accumulating at least 1 million ETH in its balance sheet. If fully utilised at current prices, the new offering could give SharpLink control of nearly 1.38% of ETH’s circulating supply. Since launching its treasury program in June, SharpLink has consistently increased its ETH holdings in strategic tranches. The firm has already added $515 million worth of ETH in the past nine days, including a single-day buy of over 32,000 ETH. As of July 16, SharpLink held more than 280,000 ETH, with 99.7% of it staked to earn on-chain yield. Its latest purchases came shortly after raising $413 million through its ATM program in early July. Between June 2 and July 15, the company generated 415 ETH in staking rewards, valued at roughly $1.49 million at the time of disclosure. More than just a treasury asset SharpLink views ETH not just as a reserve asset but as working capital. Nearly all of its ETH is staked, with additional returns generated via restaking protocols. The company’s aggressive accumulation has drawn comparisons to institutional Bitcoin strategies seen in past years. However, unlike firms that opt for passive holding, SharpLink uses Ethereum’s native staking mechanisms to compound returns while maintaining high exposure to the asset’s long-term growth. Amid this backdrop is Ethereum’s newfound status as a corporate treasury asset. Companies like Bit Digital and BitMine Immersion have followed similar paths of late and have pivoted to ETH-centric reserve models.

Amid this backdrop is Ethereum’s newfound status as a corporate treasury asset. Companies like Bit Digital and BitMine Immersion have followed similar paths of late and have pivoted to ETH-centric reserve models.

2025-07-18 08:46:50+00:00,UK Minister Urges Ban on Crypto Political Donations Over Foreign Influence Fears,"Amid rising concerns that foreign powers could exploit untraceable cryptocurrency to sway British politics, UK Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden has called for election officials to consider banning political donations made in digital currencies. Key Takeaways: UK minister Pat McFadden has asked for a review of crypto political donations. Campaigners warn that unregulated crypto donations could enable covert foreign influence. Lawmakers call for stronger enforcement and transparency. Speaking to MPs, McFadden said tracing crypto donations is challenging, urging the Electoral Commission to review whether current rules are fit for purpose in the evolving digital age. McFadden’s remarks follow Nigel Farage’s announcement that his Reform UK party would become the first British political group to accept Bitcoin donations , echoing moves by Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. Crypto Donations Could Enable Covert Foreign Interference in Politics Campaigners like Spotlight on Corruption warn that such practices could open doors for covert foreign interference, undermining democratic processes. During a joint Commons and Lords committee session on national security, Labour MP Liam Byrne pressed McFadden on the issue, prompting the minister to stress the importance of transparency and legislative updates to protect the integrity of political funding. Further concerns were raised about donations from “unlimited companies,” whose financial records are difficult to scrutinize. Both McFadden and Byrne agreed that strengthening resources for the Electoral Commission and the National Crime Agency is essential to better police political finances. Byrne described current party finance rules as a “Kremlin’s charter” favoring opacity, calling for bans on crypto donations and foreign money, alongside enhanced enforcement. NIGEL FARAGE''S REFORM UK BECOMES THE 1ST PARTY IN BRITAIN TO ACCEPT #BITCOIN DONATIONS pic.twitter.com/9ZQXtvNPIL — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) May 29, 2025 While McFadden’s comments signal openness to tighter crypto donation controls, government sources indicate upcoming election reform proposals may stop short of an outright ban. Instead, the forthcoming strategy paper is expected to tighten general foreign interference rules, extend them to digital currencies, and promote voter registration reforms, such as lowering the voting age to 16 and protecting candidates from abuse. Transparency campaigners remain wary that the government may avoid capping donations or restoring the Electoral Commission’s criminal investigation powers. As calls grow for stronger donation checks, including peer Margaret Hodge and democracy advocate Tom Brake, the debate continues over how to safeguard UK democracy against evolving threats in the digital era. UK to Enforce Mandatory Crypto Trade Reporting The UK will require crypto firms to collect and report detailed customer information on every trade and transfer starting January 1, 2026, as part of a sweeping effort to strengthen tax compliance and oversight in the digital asset sector. According to a recent statement from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the new rules will mandate that platforms record full names, home addresses, and tax identification numbers for all users. Each transaction must also be logged with specifics such as the cryptocurrency used and the amount transferred. The reporting obligation extends beyond individual users to include companies, trusts, and charities engaged in crypto activity. Firms that fail to comply or submit inaccurate data may face penalties of up to £300 ($398) per user.

2025-07-18 08:50:30+00:00,Anthropic Claude’s Alarming New Usage Limits Spark Outcry,"BitcoinWorld Anthropic Claude’s Alarming New Usage Limits Spark Outcry In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, where innovation often outpaces established norms, a recent development has sent ripples of concern through the developer community. Users of Anthropic Claude , a leading AI model known for its advanced capabilities, have suddenly encountered unexpected and unannounced usage limits, sparking frustration and disrupting ongoing projects. This abrupt change raises questions about transparency and the future reliability of essential Developer AI tools . Anthropic Claude Users Face Unexpected Restrictions Since Monday morning, a significant number of Anthropic Claude users, particularly those heavily reliant on the service, have been met with perplexing restrictions. These unexpected changes have manifested as abrupt ‘Claude usage limit reached’ messages, often accompanied by a vague time frame for reset. The core issue? A complete lack of official communication from Anthropic regarding these new limitations. Many affected users, especially those subscribed to the premium $200-a-month Claude Max plan , voiced their concerns on Claude Code’s GitHub page. The sentiment is clear: users feel blindsided. One user articulated this frustration, stating, “Your tracking of usage limits has changed and is no longer accurate. There is no way in the 30 minutes of a few requests I have hit the 900 messages.” This indicates a perceived discrepancy between their actual usage and the new, undisclosed limits. Navigating New AI Usage Limits: A Sudden Shift The sudden imposition of new AI usage limits without prior notice presents a significant challenge for developers and businesses integrating Claude Code into their workflows. For many, these models are not just tools but critical components of their operational infrastructure. The inability to predict or plan for these restrictions effectively halts progress and introduces an element of unreliability. An Anthropic representative acknowledged the issues, stating, “We’re aware that some Claude Code users are experiencing slower response times, and we’re working to resolve these issues.” However, this brief statement failed to address the core concern: the unannounced usage limits themselves. This ambiguity has left users in the dark, unable to ascertain whether these are temporary glitches or permanent policy shifts. The broader network issues reported during the same period, including API overload errors and six separate incidents on Anthropic’s status page over four days, further compound the problem. While the status page oddly still shows ‘100 percent uptime’ for the week, the user experience paints a different picture, highlighting a disconnect between reported metrics and real-world performance. The Claude Max Plan Conundrum: Value vs. Viability The $200-a-month Claude Max plan , designed for heavy users, promised usage limits 20 times higher than a Pro subscription. However, the recent changes cast a shadow over this value proposition. Users who invested in this premium tier are now finding their access curtailed, leading to questions about the plan’s long-term viability. One user, speaking anonymously to Bitcoin World, highlighted the severe impact: “It just stopped the ability to make progress.” This individual, who often makes over $1000 worth of API calls daily on the Max plan, admitted that such high usage might be unsustainable for Anthropic. Yet, the expectation was for transparent communication, not sudden, unannounced cutbacks. The core of the problem lies in Anthropic’s ambiguous pricing structure. While tiered limits exist, the company explicitly states that free user limits “will vary by demand” and avoids setting absolute values. This ‘flexible’ approach, now seemingly extended to paid plans, makes it impossible for users to plan their projects around consistent access, creating an unpredictable environment for development. Impact on Developer AI Tools and Productivity For developers deeply embedded in their projects, the unexpected limitations on their primary Developer AI tools like Claude Code have a cascading effect on productivity. The user who spoke to Bitcoin World lamented the lack of comparable alternatives, stating, “I tried Gemini and Kimi, but there’s really nothing else that’s competitive with the capability set of Claude Code right now.” This highlights Anthropic’s strong market position but also the significant dependence users have on its capabilities. The disruption forces developers to either halt their work, significantly slow down, or attempt to migrate to less capable platforms, all of which incur substantial costs in terms of time, effort, and potential project delays. This situation underscores the critical need for stability and predictability when relying on third-party AI services for mission-critical applications.

2025-07-18 08:51:35+00:00,Missed Pi Network’s Pi2Day? Here’s Everything You Need to Know,"TL;DR Pi Network’s Core Team organized an online event that took place from June 28 (known as Pi2Day) until July 7, which had numerous activities and also saw the launch of two crucial features. A few weeks after its completion, the team has published a recap outlining the most important takeaways of the event. Pi App Studio and Challenge The blog posts noted that more than 2.6 million Pioneers (users within the project’s ecosystem) took part in the Pi2Day Ecosystem Challenge, and 761,000 of them “powered through every step to claim this year’s limited-edition username badge and color.” “Participation was strong across regions, showing community engagement and eagerness to explore and test new utilities as soon as they launch,” reads the statement. It also focuses on arguably the most significant new feature for users – the Pi App Studio. The team describes it as a “no-code, AI-assisted platform, which enables anyone – regardless of technical background – to build and own functional apps in Pi’s decentralized ecosystem.” Since its launch, nearly 35,000 community members have participated in some form, creating more than 7,600 chatbots and over 14,000 custom apps. The team provided a few examples of newly-launched apps, such as one chatbot providing information on space and the universe, and another that focuses on Pioneers living a healthier lifestyle. It’s worth noting, though, that the Core Team said they do not verify, evaluate, endorse, or review the applications launched through the Pi App Studio and are available through the Pi Browser, and warned: “Your use of these apps is at your own risk, and we strongly encourage you to use caution when using them.” Pi Staking The other significant new feature, which is perhaps even more important for Pi investors, is called Ecosystem Directory Staking. As the name suggests, it allows Pi token holders to stake their tokens, but in a relatively different manner. EDS is a platform-level utility enabling businesses and users to “boost the ranking of Pi apps in the Ecosystem Interface by staking Pi tokens on the Mainnet blockchain.” Even though it has been live for less than a month, it has already attracted almost 38 million Pi in total, with over 25 million tokens still actively staked. The number of Pioneers taking advantage of this feature is above 16,700. “The staking feature introduced a community-driven way to surface apps and services that Pioneers and businesses want to promote and support.” Although staking allows investors to lock their tokens for a certain period to earn rewards and reduce the selling pressure, the underlying asset has not felt the benefits yet. Its price is down by 10% weekly and almost 19% monthly to $0.45. Just for reference, many other crypto assets, including BTC and XRP , have gone vertical within this timeframe with new all-time highs. The post Missed Pi Network’s Pi2Day?

2025-07-18 09:00:00+00:00,SharpLink Aims for 1M ETH While Revenue Shrinks,"BTC Digital also shifted its core strategy from Bitcoin to Ethereum, joining a growing list of firms holding ETH. This accumulation, along with record-breaking ETF inflows and favorable macro conditions, sparked optimism for a potential ETH rally to $10,000. Analysts point to decreasing supply, increased staking, and Ethereum’s growing role in decentralized finance as key catalysts. SharpLink Loads Up on ETH SharpLink Gaming, a company backed by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, dramatically ramped up its Ethereum acquisition strategy by adding $515 million worth of ETH to its treasury in just nine days. In a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), SharpLink announced it will increase its share offering to $6 billion, up from $1 billion in a previous May 30 filing. The majority of the proceeds will go toward buying ETH as part of the company’s aggressive crypto treasury strategy. SharpLink stated that the funds will also be used for working capital, general corporate purposes, operating expenses, and affiliate marketing operations. With this move, the company is signaling its intent to potentially hold up to 1 million ETH, according to recent posts on X . As of Tuesday, SharpLink accumulated over 280,000 ETH, with 99.7% of it staked, and generated 415 ETH in staking rewards worth approximately $1.49 million between June 2 and July 15. After the new filing, the company purchased an additional 32,892 ETH valued at $115 million. This brought its total recent purchases to over half a billion dollars. Galaxy Research pointed out that SharpLink now holds more ETH than the Ethereum Foundation itself, and called the development a positive catalyst for the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite the bold accumulation strategy, SharpLink’s stock (SBET) declined by 2.62% on Thursday, closing at $36.40 and falling by about 4.95% to $34.60 in after-hours trading. The stock is still up 350% year-to-date. Financially, the company reported a 24% year-on-year revenue drop in the March quarter, alongside a 110% decline in its net profit margin. SharpLink stock price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) SharpLink is expected to release its next quarterly results on Aug. 13. BTC Digital Swaps Bitcoin for Ethereum Ethereum is also attracting the attention of other companies. BTC Digital, a blockchain technology and mining company, announced a complete strategic pivot to Ethereum as its core asset. The firm revealed this shift alongside the closure of a $6 million financing round. As part of its new direction, BTC Digital disclosed a fresh $1 million Ethereum purchase and shared details about plans to convert all of its current and future Bitcoin holdings into ETH. The company plans to build a long-term, on-chain Ethereum-based asset pool to support mid- and long-term growth initiatives. Announcement from BTC Digital CEO Siguang Peng described Ethereum as the leading platform for decentralized finance, real-world asset tokenization, and scalable smart contract innovation. BTC Digital now plans to grow its ETH reserves into the tens of millions of dollars by year-end and intends to generate returns through ETH staking, participation in DeFi protocols, stablecoins, and real-world asset projects. Transitioning away from its previous mining-centered model, BTC Digital is now positioning itself as a digital asset operator that is focused on productive, yield-generating Ethereum-based strategies. This includes launching ETH-backed yield pools, building stablecoin infrastructure, and expanding into DeFi, NFTs, and Ethereum layer-2 ecosystems. The company’s stock saw little immediate reaction to the announcement, and dipped slightly to close at $3.44 on Thursday.

This is according to ZX Squared Capital partner Felix Xu. In an interview , Xu argued that recent data contradicts the likelihood of a sharp price reversal. A key driver, he said, is the growing demand for US spot Ether ETFs, which saw a record-breaking $727 million in inflows on Wednesday alone. This was the largest single-day figure since trading began in July of 2024. These coins are being moved into cold storage, making them unavailable for immediate resale and reducing the circulating supply.

BTC Digital also shifted its core strategy from Bitcoin to Ethereum, joining a growing list of firms holding ETH. This accumulation, along with record-breaking ETF inflows and favorable macro conditions, sparked optimism for a potential ETH rally to $10,000. Analysts point to decreasing supply, increased staking, and Ethereum’s growing role in decentralized finance as key catalysts. SharpLink Loads Up on ETH SharpLink Gaming, a company backed by Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, dramatically ramped up its Ethereum acquisition strategy by adding $515 million worth of ETH to its treasury in just nine days. In a recent filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), SharpLink announced it will increase its share offering to $6 billion, up from $1 billion in a previous May 30 filing. The majority of the proceeds will go toward buying ETH as part of the company’s aggressive crypto treasury strategy. SharpLink stated that the funds will also be used for working capital, general corporate purposes, operating expenses, and affiliate marketing operations. With this move, the company is signaling its intent to potentially hold up to 1 million ETH, according to recent posts on X . As of Tuesday, SharpLink accumulated over 280,000 ETH, with 99.7% of it staked, and generated 415 ETH in staking rewards worth approximately $1.49 million between June 2 and July 15. After the new filing, the company purchased an additional 32,892 ETH valued at $115 million. This brought its total recent purchases to over half a billion dollars. Galaxy Research pointed out that SharpLink now holds more ETH than the Ethereum Foundation itself, and called the development a positive catalyst for the Ethereum ecosystem. Despite the bold accumulation strategy, SharpLink’s stock (SBET) declined by 2.62% on Thursday, closing at $36.40 and falling by about 4.95% to $34.60 in after-hours trading. The stock is still up 350% year-to-date. Financially, the company reported a 24% year-on-year revenue drop in the March quarter, alongside a 110% decline in its net profit margin.

2025-07-18 09:00:23+00:00,Bitcoin Rally Not Over Yet? Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Further Upside,"As Bitcoin (BTC) consolidates just below the $120,000 mark, concerns are mounting over whether the top cryptocurrency’s bullish momentum is fading. However, some analysts believe BTC still has room to grow, citing key on-chain indicators. Bitcoin Rally Far From Over According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Darkfost, Bitcoin’s rally is not yet over. The analyst points to the Short-Term Holder (STH) Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator as evidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profit-Taking Spikes Without Price Drop – Strong Demand Or Delayed Reaction? For context, STH MVRV measures the profitability of Bitcoin held by short-term investors – typically those who acquired BTC within the last 155 days – by comparing the current market price to their average purchase price. When the STH MVRV is high, it suggests short-term holders are in profit and may sell. On the contrary, a low or negative MVRV indicates undervaluation and potential for further upside. Darkfost noted that during the current market cycle, unrealized profits among STH have yet to surpass the 42% threshold. Historically, every time the STH MVRV reaches around 1.35 – implying a 35% unrealized profit – it has triggered a wave of profit-taking, followed by short-term price pullbacks. As of now, the STH MVRV stands at approximately 1.15, well below the profit-taking zone. The analyst attributes this to the STH realized price exceeding $100,000 for the first time in Bitcoin’s history on July 11. At the time of writing, this realized price has risen above $102,000, providing BTC with a robust support base. To clarify, STH realized price refers to the average price at which all Bitcoin held by short-term holders was acquired. When Bitcoin’s current market price remains above this level, it reflects growing market confidence among newer investors. Darkfost added that BTC could rise another 20–25% before the STH MVRV reaches its critical level again. If this projection holds, Bitcoin could potentially hit $150,000 before the next wave of widespread profit-taking. Fresh Liquidity May Help, But Exercise Caution Bitcoin may also benefit from fresh liquidity entering the market.

2025-07-18 09:00:39+00:00,Crypto Retirement Plans: Trump’s Historic Order Unlocking Digital Assets for Your Future,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Retirement Plans: Trump’s Historic Order Unlocking Digital Assets for Your Future Are you looking for innovative ways to secure your financial future, perhaps even venturing beyond traditional stocks and bonds? The world of retirement planning is on the cusp of a potentially revolutionary shift, and it’s being driven by a surprising source: a prospective executive order from U.S. President Donald Trump. Imagine a future where your Crypto Retirement Plans aren’t just a dream, but a tangible reality within your 401(k) or other retirement vehicles. This is precisely what’s being discussed, promising to reshape how Americans approach long-term wealth building. What’s Happening: Trump’s Game-Changing Crypto Executive Order The financial world is buzzing with reports that U.S. President Donald Trump is poised to sign an executive order that could fundamentally alter the landscape of retirement investing. According to sources like Crypto Briefing, this order aims to remove existing barriers, paving the way for the inclusion of both cryptocurrencies and gold in established retirement plans, such as the widely popular 401(k)s. This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a directive that could compel regulators to review and eliminate the hurdles that have, until now, largely kept these alternative assets out of mainstream retirement portfolios. For years, investing in digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum within a regulated retirement account has been fraught with complexities, often requiring specialized, self-directed IRAs that come with their own set of rules and limitations. Similarly, direct physical gold investments in 401(k)s have faced stringent regulations. This anticipated Trump Crypto Executive Order signifies a potential top-down push to legitimize and integrate these assets into the core of American retirement savings, offering a new dimension of diversification and growth potential for millions of investors. The implications are vast, suggesting a future where: Easier Access: Individuals might find it simpler to allocate a portion of their 401(k) or similar plans to cryptocurrencies and gold without navigating complex, niche investment vehicles. Regulatory Clarity: The order would likely compel agencies like the Department of Labor and the IRS to provide clearer guidelines, reducing the ambiguity that has often deterred mainstream financial institutions from offering these options. Increased Adoption: With clearer pathways, more fund providers and employers might begin to offer crypto and gold options, leading to broader adoption across the retirement savings ecosystem. This move, if enacted, underscores a growing recognition of digital assets and precious metals as legitimate components of a diversified investment strategy, even at the highest levels of government. Why Consider Digital Assets for Your Retirement? The idea of holding Digital Assets Retirement accounts might seem novel to some, but it’s a concept gaining significant traction among investors seeking diversification and inflation protection. Cryptocurrencies, despite their volatility, have demonstrated remarkable growth potential over the past decade, often outperforming traditional asset classes. Gold, on the other hand, has historically served as a reliable store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation. Benefits of Including Digital Assets and Gold: Diversification Beyond Traditional Assets: Stocks and bonds are correlated; when one goes down, the other often follows. Cryptocurrencies and gold, however, often exhibit low correlation with traditional markets, meaning they might move independently, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Inflation Hedge: In times of rising inflation, the purchasing power of fiat currencies erodes. Gold has long been a classic inflation hedge, and many argue that Bitcoin, with its capped supply, could serve a similar purpose in the digital age. Potential for High Growth: While past performance is not indicative of future results, the growth trajectory of leading cryptocurrencies has been exponential. Allocating a small portion of a retirement portfolio could offer exposure to significant upside potential. Accessibility and Liquidity (for Crypto): Digital assets can be traded 24/7 on global exchanges, offering unparalleled liquidity compared to some traditional assets. Challenges and Considerations: It’s crucial to approach this with a balanced perspective. While the benefits are compelling, there are significant challenges: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. Significant price swings, both up and down, are common. This inherent risk needs to be carefully weighed, especially for long-term retirement planning. Regulatory Uncertainty: While the executive order aims to reduce barriers, the regulatory landscape for digital assets is still evolving. Future regulations could impact their value or accessibility.

Analyst Answers!","After a week of record-breaking gains, Bitcoin (BTC) has been led by Ethereum this week. ETH made a significant surge this week, reaching a 45% surge over the past month. ETH reached $3,670 with this attack, its highest level since January. While the rise in Ethereum and its leading altcoins is expected to continue, one analyst said that ETH is not expected to undergo a sharp correction anytime soon after its 43% surge in the past month. Felix Xu, partner at crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, stated that Ethereum’s rapid rise could continue and that a sharp pullback is unlikely if two key macro conditions persist. At this point, the analyst noted that a rapid and sharp pullback is unlikely unless ETF inflows into Ethereum stop and the Fed makes policy changes. “All the hard data coming in this week argues against a quick reversal. Unless ETF inflows suddenly stop and the Fed simultaneously turns sharply hawkish, a sharp pullback like the 30% drop in October 2024 seems unlikely. The analyst emphasized that ETH held in spot ETH ETFs is locked in cold storage, reducing selling pressure and shrinking available supply. “Furthermore, this contraction in ETH supply, combined with dovish policy expectations from the Fed and strong investor sentiment, creates a low probability of any sudden trend reversal in ETH,” he said. Can Ethereum Reach $10,000? While the market generally expects Ethereum to reach $10,000 by the end of this year, the analyst approached this situation with caution. The analyst stated that $10,000 is ambitious but not impossible and added: “The $10,000 target implies a 190% move in just over five months. This is something ETH only achieved during the 2017 ICO craze and the 2020-21 DeFi boom.

2025-07-18 09:10:46+00:00,Bitcoin Transfer: Massive BTC Inflow to Coinbase Prime Sparks Market Alert,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transfer: Massive BTC Inflow to Coinbase Prime Sparks Market Alert The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with the latest on-chain alert: a massive Bitcoin transfer of over 4,500 BTC, valued at approximately $541 million, has flowed into spot exchanges within a single hour. This significant movement, primarily directed towards Coinbase Prime, has immediately caught the attention of market analysts and investors alike, prompting crucial questions about its potential implications for the broader crypto market. What Does This Significant Bitcoin Transfer Mean? According to a recent alert from CryptoQuant, a leading on-chain analytics platform, a staggering 4,530 BTC made its way onto centralized exchanges. This isn’t just a routine deposit; the sheer volume and the destination point to potentially significant institutional activity. To put it into perspective, this single hour’s inflow represents a substantial portion of daily trading volumes on many exchanges, making it an event worth dissecting. The breakdown of where these Bitcoins landed offers further insights: Coinbase Prime: A colossal 4,287 BTC (approximately 94% of the total inflow) Coinbase Advanced: A smaller but still notable 239 BTC (around 5%) Gemini: A negligible 2 BTC This distribution is key. The overwhelming majority landing on Coinbase Prime suggests a specific type of participant is behind this Bitcoin transfer. But what exactly does this mean for the market? Understanding the BTC Exchange Flow Dynamics When a large amount of Bitcoin moves to exchanges, it typically signals an intent to sell. Unlike holding Bitcoin in cold storage or private wallets, moving it to an exchange makes it readily available for trading. Therefore, a substantial BTC exchange flow like this can often be interpreted as a potential increase in selling pressure, which could, in turn, lead to a downward movement in Bitcoin’s price. However, the narrative isn’t always that straightforward. There are several reasons why such a large inflow might occur, and not all of them are bearish: OTC Deals: Large institutional players often conduct Over-The-Counter (OTC) deals, where they buy or sell large blocks of Bitcoin directly with a broker, bypassing the open market. While the Bitcoin might pass through an exchange’s prime brokerage arm (like Coinbase Prime) for settlement, it doesn’t necessarily mean it will be dumped onto the spot market. Rebalancing Portfolios: Institutions might be rebalancing their crypto portfolios, converting some Bitcoin into stablecoins or other cryptocurrencies. Operational Needs: Large entities might need to move Bitcoin to exchanges for various operational reasons, such as facilitating payments, covering margin calls, or preparing for a new product launch. The critical distinction here lies in whether the Bitcoin is intended for immediate liquidation on the open market or for a more structured, off-market transaction. The destination, Coinbase Prime, often points towards the latter. Why is Coinbase Prime Activity So Crucial? Coinbase Prime activity is a significant indicator for institutional interest and participation in the crypto space. Coinbase Prime is not your average retail trading platform. It’s designed specifically for institutional investors, offering a comprehensive suite of services including: Advanced Trading Tools: Sophisticated order types, algorithmic trading, and deep liquidity pools. Prime Brokerage Services: Custody, financing, and execution services tailored for large-scale clients. OTC Desks: Facilitating large block trades without impacting market prices significantly. When nearly 94% of a massive BTC exchange flow lands on Coinbase Prime, it strongly suggests that institutional players are at work. These entities typically operate with long-term strategies and substantial capital. Their movements, while potentially causing short-term ripples, are often part of broader investment theses rather than speculative day trading. Monitoring Coinbase Prime activity provides a window into the actions of some of the biggest players in the crypto world. Their moves can often foreshadow broader market trends or signal significant shifts in institutional sentiment. Exploring the Potential Crypto Market Impact The immediate reaction to such a large inflow is often apprehension among retail traders, fearing a market dump. While this is a valid concern, the actual crypto market impact depends heavily on the intent behind the transfer. If this Bitcoin is indeed destined for an OTC sale, the direct impact on spot market prices might be minimal, as the transaction occurs off-exchange. However, even if it’s an OTC deal, it doesn’t mean there’s no impact at all. A large institutional sale, even off-market, can still influence sentiment. If the buyer is a new entrant, it’s bullish. If an existing holder is liquidating, it could be seen as bearish, signaling a shift in their outlook.

The critical distinction here lies in whether the Bitcoin is intended for immediate liquidation on the open market or for a more structured, off-market transaction. The destination, Coinbase Prime, often points towards the latter. Why is Coinbase Prime Activity So Crucial? Coinbase Prime activity is a significant indicator for institutional interest and participation in the crypto space. Coinbase Prime is not your average retail trading platform. It’s designed specifically for institutional investors, offering a comprehensive suite of services including: Advanced Trading Tools: Sophisticated order types, algorithmic trading, and deep liquidity pools. Prime Brokerage Services: Custody, financing, and execution services tailored for large-scale clients. OTC Desks: Facilitating large block trades without impacting market prices significantly. When nearly 94% of a massive BTC exchange flow lands on Coinbase Prime, it strongly suggests that institutional players are at work. These entities typically operate with long-term strategies and substantial capital. Their movements, while potentially causing short-term ripples, are often part of broader investment theses rather than speculative day trading. Monitoring Coinbase Prime activity provides a window into the actions of some of the biggest players in the crypto world. Their moves can often foreshadow broader market trends or signal significant shifts in institutional sentiment. Exploring the Potential Crypto Market Impact The immediate reaction to such a large inflow is often apprehension among retail traders, fearing a market dump. While this is a valid concern, the actual crypto market impact depends heavily on the intent behind the transfer. If this Bitcoin is indeed destined for an OTC sale, the direct impact on spot market prices might be minimal, as the transaction occurs off-exchange. However, even if it’s an OTC deal, it doesn’t mean there’s no impact at all. A large institutional sale, even off-market, can still influence sentiment. If the buyer is a new entrant, it’s bullish. If an existing holder is liquidating, it could be seen as bearish, signaling a shift in their outlook. Consider these potential scenarios for the broad"

The company will diversify its crypto portfolio to include Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), Ripple (XRP), Stablecoin (USDC), Solana(SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC). Thumzup CEO Robert Steele said the company was committed to staying at the forefront of crypto as the U.S. government sought to bring more regulatory clarity and crypto-friendly policies. He added that diversifying the company’s crypto portfolio allowed it to gain greater general exposure to the crypto space. Steele believes the company is well-positioned to create value for TZUP shareholders. Donald Trump Jr. owns roughly 350K of Thumzup’s shares valued at over $4M. The California-based firm currently holds about 19 BTC worth over $2.3M. It also plans to make heavy investments in major altcoins, whose allocations per coin have yet to be specified. The company’s expansion of its crypto treasury beyond Bitcoin parallels the growth of its AdTech platform. Steele says shareholders come first The company’s CEO said the decision to increase crypto holdings was in the best interest of shareholders. He added that expanding beyond Bitcoin to include other altcoins made sense. The company plans to purchase the crypto using $6.5 million raised earlier this month. It will also accelerate Bitcoin accumulation to make 90% of its crypto assets in BTC . Thumzup also established a BTC-backed credit facility with Coinbase Prime to give the company flexible access to “non-dilutive working capital” while executing its strategy to accumulate more Bitcoin. The company’s team believes that demand for the limited supply of Bitcoin will only continue to drive prices higher. Thumzup plans to pay its users in BTC to post about local businesses they love. “Thumzup’s decisive actions demonstrate our Board of Directors’ ongoing commitment to protect and create long-term value for our shareholders…We are proud to see such momentum and are looking forward to the path ahead.” – Robert Steele , CEO at Thumzup Thumzup recently announced that it had surpassed 1K advertiser locations and achieved a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 218%.

2025-07-18 09:20:44+00:00,Massive Bitcoin Transfer Unveils Crucial Institutional Move,"BitcoinWorld Massive Bitcoin Transfer Unveils Crucial Institutional Move In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, every significant movement on the blockchain sends ripples, and few are as impactful as those made by the market’s largest players. Recently, the crypto community was abuzz following a report from Whale Alert, a prominent blockchain tracker, detailing a massive Bitcoin transfer of 4,500 BTC. This colossal sum, valued at approximately $541 million at the time of the transaction, moved from an unknown wallet directly to Galaxy Digital , a leading institutional crypto firm. What does such a substantial shift of digital assets signify? Let’s delve into the layers of this intriguing development and uncover its potential implications for the broader crypto landscape. Unpacking the Massive Bitcoin Transfer: A Closer Look The reported Bitcoin transfer wasn’t just another routine transaction; its sheer size immediately caught the attention of analysts and investors alike. At 4,500 BTC, this single movement represents a significant portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, making it a pivotal event to monitor. The transfer originated from an ‘unknown wallet,’ a common term in blockchain analytics referring to an address that hasn’t been publicly identified or linked to a known entity. While this anonymity might raise questions for some, it’s a fundamental aspect of Bitcoin’s pseudonymous nature. It doesn’t necessarily imply illicit activity but rather points to an address not associated with a major exchange or publicly declared entity. The destination, however, is far from unknown: Galaxy Digital . This detail transforms the transaction from a mere large movement into a potentially strategic institutional maneuver. Understanding who Galaxy Digital is and why they would be the recipient of such a vast amount of Bitcoin is crucial to interpreting the event’s significance. Galaxy Digital’s Strategic Role: Why This Destination Matters Galaxy Digital is not just another name in the crypto space; it’s a powerhouse founded by Michael Novogratz, a former Wall Street hedge fund manager. The firm operates at the intersection of traditional finance and the nascent digital asset economy, offering a wide array of services including asset management, trading, investment banking, and mining. Their core mission revolves around facilitating institutional participation in the crypto market. When a substantial amount of Bitcoin flows into a regulated and institutionally focused entity like Galaxy Digital, it often suggests one of several scenarios: Custody Solutions: Galaxy Digital provides secure custody services for large clients. This transfer could represent a new institutional client entrusting their Bitcoin to Galaxy for safekeeping. Over-The-Counter (OTC) Trading: Large transactions often occur off-exchange through OTC desks to minimize market impact. Galaxy Digital operates such desks, and this could be part of a larger buy or sell order facilitated for a client. Internal Rebalancing: The funds could be part of Galaxy Digital’s own treasury management, rebalancing their assets, or preparing for new investment vehicles. Regardless of the specific reason, the transfer to Galaxy Digital underscores the growing trend of professionalization and institutionalization within the Bitcoin market. It highlights the role of regulated entities in providing the infrastructure and services necessary for traditional finance to engage with digital assets. The Enigma of the Crypto Whale Movement: What Are They Signalling? The term ‘ crypto whale ‘ refers to an individual or entity holding a significant amount of cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices through their transactions. Tracking these whales is a common practice among market analysts, as their movements can offer insights into market sentiment, potential liquidity shifts, and future price action. When a whale moves 4,500 BTC, especially to an institutional player, it can signal several things: Confidence in Long-Term Holding: If the transfer is for custody, it suggests a long-term bullish outlook from the whale, as they are securing their assets with a trusted institutional partner rather than actively trading. Increased Institutional Demand: It could indicate that a new, large institutional player is entering the market or expanding their existing Bitcoin holdings, utilizing Galaxy Digital’s services. Preparation for Strategic Action: While less common for transfers *to* an institutional custodian, it could also be part of a complex strategic move, such as an upcoming fund launch or a significant acquisition that requires secure asset management.

2025-07-18 09:30:55+00:00,Crypto Tax Exemption: Unlocking a Promising Future for Digital Payments in the US,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Tax Exemption: Unlocking a Promising Future for Digital Payments in the US Imagine using cryptocurrency to buy your morning coffee, a small online subscription, or even a digital game. Sounds seamless, right? In reality, for many, every single one of these micro-transactions could trigger a taxable event, turning a simple purchase into a complex accounting headache. This burdensome reality has long been a major barrier to the widespread adoption of digital assets for everyday use. But there’s promising news on the horizon: the White House is signaling continued support for a crypto tax exemption for de minimis transactions, a move that could significantly streamline how we use digital currencies. What Exactly is the De Minimis Rule Crypto Exemption, and Why Does It Matter? The term “de minimis” comes from the Latin phrase “de minimis non curat lex,” meaning “the law does not concern itself with trifles.” In the context of taxation, a de minimis exemption allows small amounts of income or gains to be excluded from tax reporting requirements. While common in other areas of finance – for instance, a small amount of foreign currency gain might be exempt – it has been notably absent for cryptocurrency until now. For cryptocurrency, this exemption is crucial. Currently, if you use Bitcoin to buy a $5 gift card and that Bitcoin has appreciated by even a few cents since you acquired it, you theoretically owe capital gains tax on that tiny profit. Tracking hundreds, if not thousands, of such micro-transactions over a year becomes an accounting nightmare for individuals and a deterrent for merchants considering accepting crypto. A de minimis rule crypto exemption would simplify this process immensely, making it practical to use crypto as a medium of exchange rather than just an investment vehicle. Key aspects of a potential de minimis exemption for crypto: Simplified Reporting: Eliminates the need to track tiny gains on everyday purchases. Encourages Adoption: Makes cryptocurrency more user-friendly for daily transactions. Reduces Burden: Alleviates the tax compliance load for individuals and small businesses. Fosters Innovation: Creates a more fertile ground for crypto-based payment solutions to flourish in the U.S. White House Crypto Policy: A Clear Signal for Everyday Payments In a recent media briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the White House’s ongoing commitment to supporting de minimis tax exemptions for cryptocurrency transactions. This reiteration underscores the administration’s broader aim to integrate crypto payments seamlessly into everyday life. This isn’t a new stance; the Trump administration has consistently expressed interest in fostering an environment where digital assets can be used without unnecessary friction. The current White House crypto policy reflects a growing recognition that for digital currencies to achieve their full potential as a medium of exchange, the existing tax framework needs to adapt. Officials are actively exploring various legislative pathways to enshrine this exemption into future U.S. laws. This proactive approach suggests a serious intent to move beyond discussions and towards concrete policy implementation, which is a significant positive for the crypto community. This support follows previous attempts by lawmakers to introduce similar measures. For example, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal proponent of clear crypto regulation, made an unsuccessful bid to incorporate a crypto tax exemption for gains under $300 into the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Understanding Cryptocurrency Taxes: How This Could Change Your Digital Wallet Experience Currently, the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes, similar to stocks or real estate. This means that every time you sell, trade, or use crypto to purchase goods or services, it’s considered a taxable event.

For those new to the space or simply trying to navigate their digital assets, cryptocurrency taxes can be incredibly complex. Imagine the scenario: You buy 0.001 BTC for $50. A month later, you use that 0.001 BTC to buy a $55 coffee. You just realized a $5 capital gain, which you need to report. Now multiply that by dozens or hundreds of small transactions throughout the year. The administrative burden quickly becomes overwhelming.

BitcoinWorld Crypto Tax Exemption: Unlocking a Promising Future for Digital Payments in the US Imagine using cryptocurrency to buy your morning coffee, a small online subscription, or even a digital game. Sounds seamless, right? In reality, for many, every single one of these micro-transactions could trigger a taxable event, turning a simple purchase into a complex accounting headache. This burdensome reality has long been a major barrier to the widespread adoption of digital assets for everyday use. But there’s promising news on the horizon: the White House is signaling continued support for a crypto tax exemption for de minimis transactions, a move that could significantly streamline how we use digital currencies. What Exactly is the De Minimis Rule Crypto Exemption, and Why Does It Matter? The term “de minimis” comes from the Latin phrase “de minimis non curat lex,” meaning “the law does not concern itself with trifles.” In the context of taxation, a de minimis exemption allows small amounts of income or gains to be excluded from tax reporting requirements. While common in other areas of finance – for instance, a small amount of foreign currency gain might be exempt – it has been notably absent for cryptocurrency until now. For cryptocurrency, this exemption is crucial. Currently, if you use Bitcoin to buy a $5 gift card and that Bitcoin has appreciated by even a few cents since you acquired it, you theoretically owe capital gains tax on that tiny profit. Tracking hundreds, if not thousands, of such micro-transactions over a year becomes an accounting nightmare for individuals and a deterrent for merchants considering accepting crypto. A de minimis rule crypto exemption would simplify this process immensely, making it practical to use crypto as a medium of exchange rather than just an investment vehicle. Key aspects of a potential de minimis exemption for crypto: Simplified Reporting: Eliminates the need to track tiny gains on everyday purchases. Encourages Adoption: Makes cryptocurrency more user-friendly for daily transactions. Reduces Burden: Alleviates the tax compliance load for individuals and small businesses. Fosters Innovation: Creates a more fertile ground for crypto-based payment solutions to flourish in the U.S. White House Crypto Policy: A Clear Signal for Everyday Payments In a recent media briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the White House’s ongoing commitment to supporting de minimis tax exemptions for cryptocurrency transactions. This reiteration underscores the administration’s broader aim to integrate crypto payments seamlessly into everyday life. This isn’t a new stance; the Trump administration has consistently expressed interest in fostering an environment where digital assets can be used without unnecessary friction. The current White House crypto policy reflects a growing recognition that for digital currencies to achieve their full potential as a medium of exchange, the existing tax framework needs to adapt. Officials are actively exploring various legislative pathways to enshrine this exemption into future U.S. laws. This proactive approach suggests a serious intent to move beyond discussions and towards concrete policy implementation, which is a significant positive for the crypto community. This support follows previous attempts by lawmakers to introduce similar measures. For example, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal proponent of clear crypto regulation, made an unsuccessful bid to incorporate a crypto tax exemption for gains under $300 into the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While that particular effort didn’t pass, the White House’s continued backing indicates that the idea itself has strong bipartisan support and remains a high priority.

Bitcoin (BTC) surged to over $120,000, and Ether (ETH) reached a high of $3,640 following the 8% daily increase. Ripple’s XRP soared almost 20% to touch a high of 2025 at $3.64.

The surge in XRP’s price also reflects increased demand for remittance-friendly tokens. Cardano (ADA) took part in the rally and gained 14.6%. The renewed push in the market began in November 2024, when Donald Trump won the elections. Bitcoin gained 36% that month, its fourth-best performance since 2021. GENIUS Act and CBDC ban define Washington’s crypto pivot The gains come after three significant crypto bills passed in the U.S House of Representatives. Among the most influential developments was the enactment of the GENIUS Act. The bill establishes a structure to regulate stablecoins and provide consumer protection. The House approved it and is currently awaiting the signature of the President. Another bill targets regulatory clarity, which seeks to separate the roles of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It seeks to distinguish between commodities and securities in the digital asset world. The bill is now moving to the Senate. A third bill was also enacted by a narrow margin, given that it would not allow the issuance of any central bank digital currency in the future. The proposal bans a U.S. government-backed digital dollar, which is also being considered in the Senate. The three bills are part of what the Trump administration has called “crypto week,” which aims to make the United States a global leader in blockchain finance. The administration says that it desires to create the “crypto capital of the world,” using the power of law to create transparency and opportunity to push innovation. Trump’s crypto links stir conflict concerns While crypto markets rally on policy progress, President Trump has had direct exposure to the industry, which has raised concerns. The financial disclosures made in July 2025 revealed that he obtained $58 million in 2024 related to crypto activities, mainly through the sale of WLFI tokens associated with World Liberty Financial. Those earnings ranked behind only his hospitality earnings and are projected to increase. Projections in 2025 predict a further $390 million through token sales and through his meme coin, launched earlier this year. The disclosures also show Trump has invested in digital ETFs, tokenized real estate, and mining Bitcoins, raising concerns about transparency and impact. His critics have said such investments are a conflict of interest because his administration promotes pro-industry reforms. The current crypto movement resembles the 2021 bull run market cap, which reached over $3 trillion in a rally marked by DeFi, NFTs, and pandemic liquidity.

2025-07-18 09:40:00+00:00,Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Market Sentiment in the ‘Greed’ Zone,"BitcoinWorld Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Navigating Market Sentiment in the ‘Greed’ Zone Are you feeling the pulse of the crypto market? The latest reading from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a fascinating snapshot of investor psychology. As of July 18, this crucial indicator, provided by the software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 73. While it marks a slight dip of one point from the previous day, the index firmly remains within the ‘Greed’ zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto holdings, and how can you navigate these fluctuating sentiments? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Barometer of Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a powerful barometer for gauging the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it provides a clear visual representation: 0 signifies ‘Extreme Fear,’ suggesting investors are highly anxious and likely selling, potentially signaling a buying opportunity for contrarians. Conversely, 100 indicates ‘Extreme Greed,’ where euphoria drives prices up, often warning of an impending correction as the market becomes overbought. This tool is invaluable for investors seeking to understand the collective mood and make more informed decisions, moving beyond mere price charts to grasp the underlying human element of the crypto market sentiment . The index doesn’t just pull a number out of thin air. It meticulously aggregates data from six distinct factors, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall market psychology. Let’s break down how this comprehensive score is calculated: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable markets can foster greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum of Bitcoin, comparing it to historical averages. Strong buying volume and momentum often correlate with greedy sentiment. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the speed and frequency of posts. A high volume of positive sentiment posts can indicate increasing greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) Historically, this component gathered public opinion through weekly polls, directly asking investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear, as investors might be moving out of altcoins and into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, decreasing dominance might suggest a shift towards altcoin speculation, indicating higher risk appetite and potentially greed. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search query data for crypto-related terms, the index gauges public interest and curiosity. Sudden surges in searches for terms like “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” often indicate fear, while terms like “how to buy crypto” or “Bitcoin rally” suggest growing public interest and greed. The current reading of 73, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests that despite a minor pullback, investors are still feeling largely optimistic and confident about the market’s trajectory. This is a crucial insight, as historical data often shows that extreme greed can precede market corrections, while extreme fear can present prime buying opportunities. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does It Mean for Your Strategy? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovers in the ‘Greed’ zone, it’s a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects strong positive momentum, with many assets potentially seeing upward price action. This can be exhilarating for investors who have held through leaner times. On the other hand, sustained periods of high greed can lead to irrational exuberance, where fundamental analysis takes a backseat to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This is precisely when the market becomes susceptible to sharp pullbacks or even significant corrections. Consider the historical patterns: often, when the index hits extreme greed (e.g., above 80-90), it signals that the market is overheating. This is when seasoned investors might start taking profits, reducing their exposure, or at least becoming more cautious about new entries. Conversely, extreme fear (e.g., below 20-30) often marks capitulation, presenting excellent long-term buying opportunities for those brave enough to go against the prevailing sentiment. For current investors, being in the ‘Greed’ zone might prompt questions like: Have my assets reached their short-term peak? Is it time to de-risk or rebalance my portfolio? Am I making decisions based on emotion rather than sound strategy?

A market cap at this level would place the crypto sector just behind Nvidia , which recently crossed the $4 trillion milestone and now holds a valuation of $4.2 trillion. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the crypto market has reached a peak of $3.8 trillion, while TradingView lists it slightly higher at $3.9 trillion, both figures exceeding the previous all-time high of $3.73 trillion recorded in December. Meanwhile, other trackers like CoinGecko have already indicated that the market has crossed the $4 trillion threshold, reflecting the sector’s rapid momentum in the current rally. Bitcoin climbed back above $120,000 on Thursday, marking a minor daily increase. However, Ether and XRP have outpaced Bitcoin in gains following the US House’s approval of key crypto legislations before its August recess. Ether surpassed $3,600 for the first time since January, bringing its fortnightly gains to 40%. Ripple’s XRP also soared by nearly 20% in a single day, hitting a year-to-date high of $3.64 during early trading on Friday. Analysts Predict More Crypto Market Upside Market analysts believe that further gains could be on the horizon as institutional confidence strengthens. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, noted that traders are witnessing digital asset prices surge due to a combination of regulatory clarity and growing institutional support. He expressed optimism that this growth trend will continue as financial institutions compete to integrate crypto assets into their services. Nassar Al Achkar, chief strategy officer at CoinW crypto market exchange, shared a similar view, stating that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen renewed interest as traders adopt a risk-on approach in response to positive regulatory signals. Al Achkar highlighted the passing of the GENIUS Act and President Trump’s proposed plans to open the US retirement market to crypto investments, which could potentially unlock trillions of dollars in institutional capital into the crypto market.

2025-07-18 09:50:02+00:00,Bitcoin Whale’s Monumental $9.7 Billion BTC Transfer Rocks Crypto Market,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale’s Monumental $9.7 Billion BTC Transfer Rocks Crypto Market Imagine waking up to news of a colossal sum of Bitcoin, nearly $10 billion worth, suddenly shifting after 14 years of dormancy. This isn’t just a fantasy; it’s the reality of a recent, truly monumental Bitcoin whale transfer that has sent ripples across the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Such a significant move from a long-dormant address immediately sparks curiosity, speculation, and intense on-chain analysis among market participants. What could compel a holder of such immense wealth to finally stir after more than a decade? And what are the broader implications for the future of the crypto market? Understanding the Monumental Bitcoin Whale Transfer The cryptocurrency world was abuzz with activity following reports from Onchain Lens on X, detailing an extraordinary BTC transfer . An address, identified as a long-term dormant Bitcoin whale , which had previously held an astonishing 80,000 BTC, initiated a significant movement of its remaining stash. On July 14, this enigmatic entity first transferred 40,010 BTC, valued at approximately $4.69 billion at the time, to Galaxy Digital . This initial move alone was enough to capture headlines, but it was merely a prelude to an even larger event. Just days later, the same address completed another massive transfer, sending its remaining 40,192 BTC, equivalent to a staggering $4.83 billion, also to Galaxy Digital . This second transfer brought the total moved by this single address to over 80,000 BTC, effectively emptying its wallet after nearly a decade and a half of inactivity. A portion of these newly moved funds has reportedly already been distributed to various exchanges, including prominent platforms like Coinbase Pro, indicating potential liquidity events or strategic positioning. The sheer scale of these transactions underscores their importance, making them one of the largest single whale movements in recent memory. Who is This Dormant Giant? Unraveling On-Chain Clues The identity of this Bitcoin whale remains shrouded in mystery, as is often the case with large cryptocurrency holders. However, the 14-year dormancy period provides crucial clues and raises compelling questions. Addresses that remain untouched for such extended periods are often associated with early adopters, miners, or even individuals who simply forgot about their holdings. The sudden activation of such a significant wallet, especially one holding over 80,000 BTC, immediately triggers deep-dive on-chain analysis . Early Adopter? This whale could be an individual or entity that acquired Bitcoin in its very nascent stages, perhaps when its value was negligible. Mining Pool? Less likely for a single address of this nature, but possible if it was a solo miner from Bitcoin’s early days. Lost Keys Recovered? While rare for such a large sum, it’s not impossible that access to the wallet was regained after a long period. Regardless of the precise identity, the movement of such old coins is often interpreted as a signal of either significant profit-taking, strategic re-allocation, or an institutional-level transaction. The public nature of blockchain transactions allows experts to track these movements, even if the owner remains anonymous. This transparency is a double-edged sword: it allows for invaluable market insights through on-chain analysis but also generates intense speculation. Galaxy Digital’s Role: A Key Player in the Bitcoin Ecosystem The choice of Galaxy Digital as the recipient for such a colossal BTC transfer is highly significant. Founded by renowned investor Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital is a prominent financial services and investment management company dedicated to the digital asset, blockchain, and cryptocurrency industries. Unlike typical retail exchanges, Galaxy Digital primarily caters to institutional clients, offering a suite of services including: Trading and Liquidity: Providing over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks for large block trades that wouldn’t typically be executed on public exchanges to avoid significant price slippage. Asset Management: Managing digital asset funds and investment products. Principal Investments: Investing directly in blockchain companies and technologies. Advisory Services: Offering strategic advice to clients in the crypto space. Mining: Engaging in Bitcoin mining operations. When a Bitcoin whale moves billions in BTC to an entity like Galaxy Digital, it strongly suggests an institutional-grade transaction rather than a simple retail sell-off. This could imply an OTC sale to an institutional buyer, a transfer for secure institutional custody, or even part of a complex rebalancing strategy for a large fund or family office. The involvement of Galaxy Digital often points towards a structured, strategic move rather than a speculative, short-term play. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market Impact?

2025-07-18 10:00:01+00:00,Dogecoin Erupts Past $0.23—Analyst Predicts Next Price Targets,"The latest burst of momentum has carried the Dogecoin price through the psychologically significant $0.23 barrier, lifting the spot price to roughly $0.236 at press time and extending a weekly advance of more than 20 percent. The breakout unfolded while Bitcoin continues to consolidate just north of the $120 000 pivot, a level that many market technicians view as decisive for the entire altcoin complex. Technical strategist Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) published a daily DOGE/USD chart via X. In it, Dogecoin’s price action is framed by a multi-month falling-trend line whose boundary was first breached in November last year. Since that escape, price has returned to the diagonal three separate times—each touch ringed by Kevin in orange, signalling what he describes as “textbook post-breakout behaviour.” Related Reading: This Fibonacci Level Puts The Dogecoin Price Above $10 This Cycle “Only a matter of time before #Dogecoin makes its move back up to the .28-.30 level and then well beyond,” he wrote. “As long as BTC holds up and keeps showing strength this should come sooner rather than later.” Dogecoin Price Targets Kevin’s roadmap is built around a dense cluster of Fibonacci retracements that dominate the right margin of his chart. Immediate resistance lies at the 0.618 and 0.65 retracement bands—approximately $0.261 and $0.285, respectively—followed by 0.703 at $0.329 and the 0.786 level at $0.413. Lower down, the 0.5 retracement at $0.190 has acted as a floor throughout July, while 0.382 at $0.138 marks the last line of defence for medium-term bulls. Beyond the classical retracement grid, Kevin projects an aggressive trio of Fibonacci extension lines—1.618 ($3.97), 1.65 ($4.33) and 1.703 ($5.00)—arguing that Dogecoin’s “thin-air zone” above last cycle’s peak could enable a parabolic overshoot if liquidity conditions mirror those of 2021. He stresses, however, that such targets “remain contingent on Bitcoin punching through $120,000-$123,000 and, ideally, sprinting toward $140,000-$150,000 where overhead supply thins out dramatically.” “People are already forgetting that #BTC drives this market and if BTC goes down it will all go down. … BTC needs to break $123,274—point-blank period. I don’t like the moseying around at this level for too long.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised For A Monster Rally Amid Brewing Altcoin Season For now, Bitcoin’s sideways grind below its all-time high has tempered altcoin exuberance. The macro picture is complicated by the fact that, as Kevin notes, “BTC, Total 2, ETH, and many other Alts are at major resistance levels—so do not try and be a hero here. If you missed the lows, that’s unfortunate, but do not FOMO at major resistance.” Should Bitcoin deliver the breakout the analyst community is looking for, the DOGE/BTC pair could accelerate sharply, validating Kevin’s view that the memecoin is “playing catch-up” and may be poised for an outsized percentage move once the broader market trend resumes.

The latest burst of momentum has carried the Dogecoin price through the psychologically significant $0.23 barrier, lifting the spot price to roughly $0.236 at press time and extending a weekly advance of more than 20 percent. The breakout unfolded while Bitcoin continues to consolidate just north of the $120 000 pivot, a level that many market technicians view as decisive for the entire altcoin complex. Technical strategist Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) published a daily DOGE/USD chart via X. In it, Dogecoin’s price action is framed by a multi-month falling-trend line whose boundary was first breached in November last year. Since that escape, price has returned to the diagonal three separate times—each touch ringed by Kevin in orange, signalling what he describes as “textbook post-breakout behaviour.” Related Reading: This Fibonacci Level Puts The Dogecoin Price Above $10 This Cycle “Only a matter of time before #Dogecoin makes its move back up to the .28-.30 level and then well beyond,” he wrote. “As long as BTC holds up and keeps showing strength this should come sooner rather than later.” Dogecoin Price Targets Kevin’s roadmap is built around a dense cluster of Fibonacci retracements that dominate the right margin of his chart. Immediate resistance lies at the 0.618 and 0.65 retracement bands—approximately $0.261 and $0.285, respectively—followed by 0.703 at $0.329 and the 0.786 level at $0.413. Lower down, the 0.5 retracement at $0.190 has acted as a floor throughout July, while 0.382 at $0.138 marks the last line of defence for medium-term bulls. Beyond the classical retracement grid, Kevin projects an aggressive trio of Fibonacci extension lines—1.618 ($3.97), 1.65 ($4.33) and 1.703 ($5.00)—arguing that Dogecoin’s “thin-air zone” above last cycle’s peak could enable a parabolic overshoot if liquidity conditions mirror those of 2021. He stresses, however, that such targets “remain contingent on Bitcoin punching through $120,000-$123,000 and, ideally, sprinting toward $140,000-$150,000 where overhead supply thins out dramatically.” “People are already forgetting that #BTC drives this market and if BTC goes down it will all go down. … BTC needs to break $123,274—point-blank period. I don’t like the moseying around at this level for too long.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised For A Monster Rally Amid Brewing Altcoin Season For now, Bitcoin’s sideways grind below its all-time high has tempered altcoin exuberance. The macro picture is complicated by the fact that, as Kevin notes, “BTC, Total 2, ETH, and many other Alts are at major resistance levels—so do not try and be a hero here. If you missed the lows, that’s unfortunate, but do not FOMO at major resistance.” Should Bitcoin deliver the breakout the analyst community is looking for, the DOGE/BTC pair could accelerate sharply, validating Kevin’s view that the memecoin is “playing catch-up” and may be poised for an outsized percentage move once the broader market trend resumes. With Dogecoin now perched on the lip of its 0.618–0.65 resistance shelf, traders are watching for a daily close above $0.285 to confirm the next leg higher. Failure to hold the wedge top near $0.19 would, by contrast, postpone the bullish narrative and leave the post-breakout retest zone vulnerable. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.242.

2025-07-18 10:07:35+00:00,"Buy, Borrow, Die: The Wealth Hack of the Ultra-Rich – Explained for Crypto Investors","In the world of high finance, the wealthy play by a different set of rules—especially when it comes to taxes. One of the most powerful and legally savvy strategies they use is known as Buy, Borrow, Die . This approach helps the ultra-rich accumulate wealth, access liquidity, and legally avoid capital gains taxes —often permanently. Here’s how this strategy works, why it’s popular, and what it might mean for crypto holders like you. 🛒 Step 1: Buy (or HODL) Appreciating Assets The journey starts with buying assets that grow in value over time . This could include: Stocks (e.g. Apple, Tesla) Real estate Business shares And yes— crypto assets like BTC, ETH, or SOL When these assets appreciate, the gains are unrealized —meaning you don’t pay capital gains tax until you sell . So if you buy 10 BTC at $10K and it grows to $60K, that’s a $500K gain... but no taxes are due as long as you don’t sell. 💳 Step 2: Borrow (Don’t Sell) Rather than cashing out and triggering a taxable event, the wealthy simply borrow against their assets . For example: They take out loans using their stocks or real estate as collateral. In crypto, this could mean using platforms like Aave, Maker, or centralized services offering crypto-backed loans . These loans aren’t considered income , so no taxes apply . This borrowed money can be used to: Fund a luxury lifestyle Reinvest in more assets Cover living expenses Key advantage : You maintain ownership of the asset, it continues to grow in value, and you defer taxes indefinitely . ⚰ Step 3: Die (Yes, Really) Here''s where the magic happens. When someone dies, their assets usually receive a ""step-up in basis"" under U.S. tax law: The cost basis (the original purchase price) is reset to the current market value. If your heirs sell the asset right after your death, they owe zero capital gains tax . So if you held BTC that went from $10K to $100K and passed it on—your heirs'' new cost basis is $100K. No tax is due if they sell at that price. Translation : The capital gains tax you avoided during life is permanently erased upon death . 🔁 The Cycle: Repeat, Grow, Escape Wealthy families use this strategy for generations: Buy appreciating assets (crypto, real estate, stocks) Borrow instead of selling to avoid taxes Die , leaving tax-free wealth to heirs This allows wealth to compound tax-free , with minimal government interference. 🧨 Can Crypto Users Use This? Yes—but with caution: Crypto lending platforms allow you to borrow against assets without selling. Be aware of liquidation risks (crypto is volatile). This strategy assumes long-term bullishness on your assets. Be ready for changing tax laws —this loophole is under political scrutiny. 🧾 Why Governments Are Watching Critics argue Buy, Borrow, Die favors the ultra-wealthy , widening the wealth gap. Governments are eyeing ways to: Tax unrealized gains Remove the step-up in basis Close loopholes around wealth transfers Crypto holders could eventually see similar scrutiny, especially as DeFi lending and self-custody blur the lines of regulation . 🧠 Final Thoughts The Buy, Borrow, Die strategy is a masterclass in long-term wealth planning , taking full advantage of current tax laws. Whether you’re holding stocks or stacking sats, understanding this strategy can inspire you to think bigger about: Asset appreciation Leveraging rather than liquidating Generational planning While it may seem like a trick reserved for billionaires, crypto gives everyone a unique opportunity to be their own bank —and maybe, just maybe, play the same wealth game.",coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/buy-borrow-die-the-wealth-hack-of-the-ultra-rich-explained-for-crypto-investors,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|ETH,,BTC,"Buy, Borrow, Die: The Wealth Hack of the Ultra-Rich – Explained for Crypto Investors.

In a period of renewed market optimism and significant capital rotation, HTX’s latest listings have once again showcased substantial wealth-generating potential. This solidifies the platform’s reputation as a go-to destination for investors looking to capitalize on emerging market trends. Between July 7 and 14, new listings across the Meme, NFT, and Infrastructure sectors achieved impressive gains. These remarkable results highlight HTX’s strategic ability to identify and list high-potential assets, providing significant wealth creation opportunities for its global user base. Meme Coin Resurgence Led by M and MOG The resurgence of meme coins saw two prominent assets deliver significant returns: ● Memecore ($M) surged an astounding 482% in just days, firmly topping the gainers’ list. Positioned as the first Layer 1 blockchain designed for the Meme 2.0 era, $M is set to become an engine driving meme culture, value creation, and community collaboration. ● MOG Coin ($MOG), another prominent meme coin, recorded a remarkable 112% increase. This Ethereum-based asset has recently garnered significant attention and discussion across social platforms. The surge in meme coin assets reaffirms the market logic that “emotion is value”. As one of the first platforms to list these tokens, HTX has effectively transformed community sentiment into trading activity, delivering tangible returns for users. Infrastructure and Cross-Chain Narratives Regain Momentum with Strong Performances from OMNI and TANSSI Technologically driven assets also performed well this week. ● Omni Network ($OMNI) jumped 260%, driven by renewed interest in inter-chain interoperability. As an Ethereum-native interoperability protocol, Omni Network enables low-latency communication across all Ethereum rollups and offers a secure, high-performance, and globally compatible architecture — positioning Ethereum as a single, unified operating system for both users and developers. ● Tanssi Network ($TANSSI) climbed the ranks with an 82% increase. As an appchain infrastructure protocol built on Polkadot’s shared security framework, Tanssi offers the ContainerChain parachain solution, providing appchains with essential services such as block production, data availability, cross-chain messaging, and external bridging. Its ecosystem also includes management tools, ready-to-use templates, and key integrations like wallets, indexers, RPC endpoints, block explorers, and oracles. HTX’s early identification of the infrastructure trend empowered previously overlooked assets to gain significant momentum on the platform, showcasing the precision of its listing strategy. $PENGU Surges on Enterprise NFT Buzz, NFT Sector Stages Strong Comeback Recently, the rise of the “enterprise NFT” narrative has sparked growing interest, with both established brands and new IPs leveraging NFTs to broaden community engagement. As a result, NFT assets are experiencing a resurgence, demonstrating strong wealth potential in this new context. ● Pudgy Penguins ($ PENGU ) witnessed an impressive 89% surge in a short period. This collection of 8,888 NFTs drives Web3 innovation through IP licensing and community-driven empowerment. Each holder gets exclusive access to experiences, events, IP licensing opportunities, and more. $PENGU has distinguished itself as one of the few NFT projects to achieve both substantial traffic and high trading volume. Popular Assets Rally as XLM and KNC Maintain Resilience Beyond the newly listed assets, established popular assets also saw significant movement: ● XLM (Stellar) rose 88%, benefiting from heightened payment activity and growing stablecoin clearing needs. As an open payment network, Stellar bridges diverse financial systems, empowering anyone to create low-cost financial services for their communities. This interconnectedness enhances individual access, reduces banking costs, and boosts business revenue. ● Kyber Network ($KNC) recorded a 65% gain, emerging as a standout in the DEX sector. The surge was driven by the release of new DeFi versions and liquidity incentive programs. Kyber Network aims to build a system that supports instant trading and seamless conversion of diverse digital assets. It offers robust payment APIs and next-generation contract wallets, enabling smooth token-to-token payments for all users.

However, before this next rocketship takes off, there could be more sideways price action. Investors will probably need to remain patient. Crypto bills passed up to the Senate The crypto story continues to gain momentum in the US as three landmark bills gained approval in the House this week. The GENIUS Act , CLARITY Act , and CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act were all passed on to the Senate for consideration. If these bills do make it into law this will firm up the case for crypto in the most powerful country in the world - quite a rapid turnaround from the bleak and unyielding anti-crypto stance presented by the Biden administration. While the CLARITY Act will help to provide consumer protection and clear regulatory guidelines for businesses, and the GENIUS Act will promote the setting up of regulation for stablecoins, arguably the most impactful bill is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Anti-CBDC Act the most important CBCD’s (Central Bank Digital Currencies) have generally been kept on the down-low in mainstream media for quite some time, and it’s only in recent times that the likes of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and others, have felt emboldened enough to announce the future implementation of CBDCs. This programmable digital currency would allow central banks to wield far more power over citizens than they already have, allowing them to manipulate, confiscate, and sanction bank accounts at will. $BTC retests support Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues on into the latter stages of its bull market. As can be seen in the short-term time frame, the price broke out of the relatively short downtrend but the bulls were unable to maintain momentum and the price is falling back down. The trendline is about to be tested again, and possibly the horizontal support at $118,000. If this gives way and the bears are able to confirm the breakdown, $117,000 down to $116,000 would be a possible net waiting to catch the price. Falling below that would mean a collapse back down to $112,000. That said, as things stand, this looks as though it may just be a retest of support. As has been the case for quite some time now, the trend is up, and if in doubt, go with that trend. $BTC volatility increase Source: TradingView The daily chart shows a lot of volatility since $BTC crossed above $118,000. The candle wicks to the up and to the downside are evidence of the struggle going on among the bulls and the bears. This support level is continuing to hold, but as already mentioned, a collapse, or even just a wick back down to $112,000 could still be on the cards. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which signals overbought and oversold conditions, is key to further price appreciation. The indicator has already been well into the overbought zone, but it still did not get above the last peak at 78.29. The indicator will probably need to bounce off of the yellow moving average and head higher to take out that last peak, if this doesn’t happen, bearish divergence is still in play.

That said, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines are approaching the top again.

Here Are the Details,"Crypto finance firm Matrixport, in its latest “Matrix on Target” report, predicted that Bitcoin may enter a correction process in the short term despite its recent upward trend. Matrixport: Bitcoin May Enter Short-Term Correction Following Multiple Factors The report states that despite positive macroeconomic developments in the US, technical indicators have weakened and the market may enter a consolidation phase in the next 1-2 months. Matrixport reminded that Bitcoin has been in a gradual upward trend since $16,000 in the last 18 months, and stated that the $106,000–108,000 level currently constitutes support. The firm argued that $122,000 is a reasonable next target, but the market may need a short-term correction before that level is reached. Overbought Signals Becoming Clearer Noting that Bitcoin has entered the overbought region from a technical perspective, the report emphasized that the RSI has risen above the 70 level and some pullback signals have formed. In this context, it was stated that a pullback to the $106,000-$108,000 region could pave the way for the next upward wave. US inflation in June, falling below expectations at 2.8%, has fueled market expectations for a near-term Fed rate cut. The report says these developments are providing support to the market, but cautions that “over-optimism” could pose a risk. Matrixport also stated that strong signals for a rate cut could be given at the FOMC meeting on July 30, but September is a more likely timeframe. While Matrixport predicts a short-term correction, it states that the long-term structure remains intact, but rather part of a healthy market cycle. The report also warns that technical formations such as “blow-off tops” or “double tops” may form following sudden market increases. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-18 10:20:09+00:00,Unveiling Crypto Cycles: Altcoin Season Index at 40 Confirms Bitcoin’s Powerful Reign,"BitcoinWorld Unveiling Crypto Cycles: Altcoin Season Index at 40 Confirms Bitcoin’s Powerful Reign Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? If so, the latest reading from the Altcoin Season Index should capture your attention. As of 00:30 UTC on July 18, this crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered 40. This figure, a slight uptick from the previous day’s 38 reported by Bitcoin World, sends a clear signal across the digital asset landscape: we are firmly entrenched in Bitcoin Season . But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio, and how should you navigate these prevailing crypto market trends ? Decoding the Altcoin Season Index: Your Compass in Crypto Market Trends To truly understand the current market dynamics, it’s essential to grasp the mechanism behind the Altcoin Season Index . This isn’t just a random number; it’s a sophisticated barometer designed to give investors a snapshot of where capital is flowing within the top echelons of the crypto space. Here’s a breakdown: What it tracks: The index rigorously compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap. Importantly, it excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, focusing solely on the volatile, speculative assets that truly reflect market sentiment. How it defines a ‘Season’: The index operates on a simple yet profound principle. For the market to be declared in ‘Altcoin Season,’ at least 75% of these top 100 coins must have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outshine Bitcoin. The Score Range: The index scores range from 1 to 100, providing a clear visual representation of the market’s bias. A score closer to 1 signifies strong Bitcoin dominance, while a score closer to 100 indicates a robust altcoin rally. Our current score of 40 firmly places us in Bitcoin territory. This index serves as a vital tool, offering insights beyond mere price movements. It helps investors identify broader crypto market trends and anticipate shifts in capital allocation, which is fundamental for any sound digital asset strategy . What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for Altcoin Performance? When the Altcoin Season Index dips into the Bitcoin Season zone, it signals a period where Bitcoin typically commands the spotlight, drawing capital away from or preventing it from flowing into smaller cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon is a recurring theme in crypto cycles, driven by several factors: Why Bitcoin Takes the Lead: Safe Haven Appeal: In times of uncertainty or volatility, Bitcoin often acts as a ‘digital gold,’ a perceived safer store of value compared to the myriad of more speculative altcoins. Investors tend to consolidate their holdings into BTC. Liquidity and Market Depth: Bitcoin boasts unparalleled liquidity, making it easier for large institutional investors and whales to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting prices. This depth is often lacking in many altcoin markets. Institutional Interest: With the advent of Bitcoin ETFs and increasing institutional adoption, a significant portion of new capital entering the crypto space often flows directly into Bitcoin first, before potentially trickling down into altcoins. Halving Cycle Influence: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, historically precede bull runs. The anticipation and post-halving dynamics often lead to Bitcoin outperforming altcoins initially. During Bitcoin Season , the average altcoin performance tends to lag. While Bitcoin makes significant gains, many altcoins might consolidate, trade sideways, or even experience declines against BTC. This doesn’t mean all altcoins will suffer equally, but the general trend favors Bitcoin. Navigating Altcoin Performance: Are All Altcoins Doomed? While the overall sentiment points to Bitcoin dominance, it’s crucial to understand that not every altcoin will underperform. The crypto market is nuanced, and even within a Bitcoin Season , specific narratives or niche sectors can see bursts of activity. However, these are often exceptions rather than the rule, and require careful research. Here’s what typically happens to altcoin performance during these periods: Capital Rotation: Funds often rotate out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, especially from projects with less clear utility or weaker fundamentals. Increased Volatility: Altcoins can become more volatile, with sharper corrections against Bitcoin as investors de-risk. Selective Pumps: Occasionally, a specific altcoin might experience a significant pump due to a unique catalyst (e.g., major upgrade, new partnership, strong community narrative), but these are often short-lived and highly speculative. For investors, this period can be a test of patience and discipline. Chasing every small altcoin pump during a Bitcoin-dominant phase can lead to significant losses if not managed strategically.

A score closer to 1 signifies strong Bitcoin dominance, while a score closer to 100 indicates a robust altcoin rally. Our current score of 40 firmly places us in Bitcoin territory. This index serves as a vital tool, offering insights beyond mere price movements. It helps investors identify broader crypto market trends and anticipate shifts in capital allocation, which is fundamental for any sound digital asset strategy . What Does Bitcoin Season Mean for Altcoin Performance? When the Altcoin Season Index dips into the Bitcoin Season zone, it signals a period where Bitcoin typically commands the spotlight, drawing capital away from or preventing it from flowing into smaller cryptocurrencies. This phenomenon is a recurring theme in crypto cycles, driven by several factors: Why Bitcoin Takes the Lead: Safe Haven Appeal: In times of uncertainty or volatility, Bitcoin often acts as a ‘digital gold,’ a perceived safer store of value compared to the myriad of more speculative altcoins. Investors tend to consolidate their holdings into BTC. Liquidity and Market Depth: Bitcoin boasts unparalleled liquidity, making it easier for large institutional investors and whales to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting prices. This depth is often lacking in many altcoin markets. Institutional Interest: With the advent of Bitcoin ETFs and increasing institutional adoption, a significant portion of new capital entering the crypto space often flows directly into Bitcoin first, before potentially trickling down into altcoins. Halving Cycle Influence: Bitcoin’s halving events, which reduce the supply of new BTC, historically precede bull runs. The anticipation and post-halving dynamics often lead to Bitcoin outperforming altcoins initially. During Bitcoin Season , the average altcoin performance tends to lag. While Bitcoin makes significant gains, many altcoins might consolidate, trade sideways, or even experience declines against BTC. This doesn’t mean all altcoins will suffer equally, but the general trend favors Bitcoin. Navigating Altcoin Performance: Are All Altcoins Doomed? While the overall sentiment points to Bitcoin dominance, it’s crucial to understand that not every altcoin will underperform. The crypto market is nuanced, and even within a Bitcoin Season , specific narratives or niche sectors can see bursts of activity. However, these are often exceptions rather than the rule, and require careful research. Here’s what typically happens to altcoin performance during these periods: Capital Rotation: Funds often rotate out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, especially from projects with less clear utility or weaker fundamentals. Increased Volatility: Altcoins can become more volatile, with sharper corrections against Bitcoin as investors de-risk. Selective Pumps: Occasionally, a specific altcoin might experience a significant pump due to a unique catalyst (e.g., major upgrade, new partnership, strong community narrative), but these are often short-lived and highly speculative. For investors, this period can be a test of patience and discipline. Chasing every small altcoin pump during a Bitcoin-dominant phase can lead to significant losses if not managed strategically.

Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed king of digital assets, has once again captured the spotlight, hitting a significant milestone that has analysts and investors on the edge of their seats. This isn’t just any price point; it’s a critical juncture, a moment where the future trajectory of the Bitcoin Price could be decided. As reported by Glassnode, BTC has touched a key resistance level near $120,000, a threshold derived from sophisticated on-chain metrics. Understanding the Current Bitcoin Price Momentum: What’s Driving the Surge? Bitcoin’s journey to this pivotal $120,000 mark hasn’t been without its twists and turns, but the underlying momentum has been undeniably strong. Several factors contribute to the current bullish sentiment surrounding the Bitcoin Price . Institutional adoption continues to grow, with major financial players increasingly recognizing Bitcoin’s value as a store of wealth and a hedge against inflation. The narrative of Bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is strengthening, attracting traditional investors seeking diversification in an uncertain global economic climate. Furthermore, the halving event, a programmed reduction in the supply of new Bitcoin, often acts as a significant catalyst for price appreciation. While the immediate impact isn’t always felt, the long-term supply shock tends to create upward pressure. Retail interest also plays a crucial role; as prices rise, more individual investors are drawn into the market, creating a virtuous cycle of demand. This confluence of factors has propelled Bitcoin into a zone where its resilience and strength are truly being tested. The $120,000 level isn’t just a round number; it represents a deeply analyzed point of market equilibrium and potential resistance, making its breach a highly anticipated event for anyone following the crypto space. Decoding Bitcoin Resistance : What Glassnode Analytics Reveal? When we talk about Bitcoin Resistance , especially at such high valuations, it’s essential to understand the underlying data driving these observations. Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics platform, has pinpointed the $120,000 level as +1 standard deviation above the short-term holder cost basis. But what does that mean in practical terms for the Bitcoin Price ? The Significance of Short-Term Holder Cost Basis What it is: The short-term holder cost basis represents the average price at which Bitcoin was acquired by investors who have held their coins for less than 155 days. These are typically newer entrants or more active traders. Why it matters: This metric acts as a crucial psychological and economic anchor. When the price falls below this cost basis, short-term holders are generally at a loss, increasing the likelihood of selling pressure. Conversely, when the price is significantly above it, these holders are in profit, and the cost basis often acts as a support level. Resistance Point: When the price reaches a certain multiple or deviation above this cost basis, it often signals a point where a significant number of short-term holders might consider taking profits, thus creating a resistance level. Understanding Standard Deviations in Market Analysis Standard deviation is a statistical measure that quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. In financial markets, it’s used to measure volatility and identify price levels that are statistically significant departures from the average. Glassnode’s use of standard deviations in relation to the short-term holder cost basis provides a powerful framework: +1 Standard Deviation: This level indicates that the current price is one standard deviation above the average acquisition price for short-term holders. Historically, in strong uptrends, this level has frequently acted as a psychological or actual resistance point where profit-taking might occur. It suggests the market is entering an area where it’s considered ‘overbought’ relative to recent short-term activity. +2 Standard Deviations: Should Bitcoin successfully push past the +1 standard deviation resistance, the next significant target often lies at +2 standard deviations. This level represents an even greater statistical deviation from the average cost basis, implying a more extended or aggressive move. Reaching this point, in this case, $136,000, would signify extreme bullish momentum and potentially a blow-off top for the short term, or a re-calibration of what constitutes a ‘normal’ price for Bitcoin. These on-chain metrics offer a unique lens into market behavior, moving beyond simple technical analysis by peering into the actual economics of different investor cohorts.

2025-07-18 10:28:24+00:00,Here’s the Next Crypto to Blow as XRP Breaks Through $3.4 ATH and Trading Volume Spikes by Nearly 4x in 2 Days,"$XRP surged in the charts over the past 24 hours, pushing it past its ATH of $3.4 from January 2025, with a market cap now surpassing $200B. The token now sits at $3.45 , following a 5% rally over the past day and 32% for the last week. The sudden surge catapulted $XRP in the charts, such that it now ranks as the 3rd largest crypto coin on the market, surpassing Tether $USDT’s market cap by $60B and placing itself below Bitcoin and Ethereum. But what’s behind this meteoric rise, and should we expect more? The House Passes Trump’s GENIUS Act, Firing Up the Crypto Bull We can largely attribute $XRP’s chart boom to the House of Representatives passing the GENIUS Act , which seeks to establish a clearer and more coherent regulatory framework for stablecoins. Senate Banking Committee Chairman, Tim Scott, applauded the move, declaring that: The GENIUS Act marks a major milestone in securing America’s leadership in payments innovation while protecting consumers and strengthening our national security.This bill is critical to delivering on President Trump’s agenda to cement the United States as the crypto capital of the world, and I look forward to taking a similar approach to get digital asset market structure legislation signed into law. — Tim Scott, Official Statement Tim Scott has been a long supporter of America’s pro-crypto policy, declaring back in January that his goal is to undo the SEC’s Gary Gensler’s anti-crypto stance, which forced many crypto projects overseas. The passing of the GENIUS Act will have significant repercussions in the crypto world, as it plans to turn crypto mainstream by merging it with US’s payment systems. In simpler terms, more people will use crypto than ever because the US government is essentially now vouching for crypto products. This explains Bitcoin’s new ATH of $123,200 on June 14, as well as $XRP’s more recent surge, with the latter raising even more eyebrows. $XRP surpassed Bitcoin’s growth by a factor of 5 over the past week, with 5% to Bitcoin’s 0.44%. With Bitcoin still pushing up and $XRP attempting its own run for a $4 ATH, it’s expected that some of the best crypto presales in 2025 will follow suit as the market maintains its upward pressure. Here are three of the most promising tokens you can get into today. 1. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – The Solana-Based Trading Bot Sniping Hot Tokens in Telegram Snorter Token ($SNORT) introduces the Snorter Bot, a trader’s most loyal friend, which snipes hot tokens straight from its Telegram chat. The Bot solves most problems associated with manual coin hunting, which include the high tech knowledge requirement and the risk of running into scams like honeypots and rug pulls. Snorter Bot simplifies the entire process of opportunistic investing by centralizing its activity in the Telegram chat; no more juggling multiple wallets, browser extensions, or trading tools. The project’s express utility, along with the meme value coming with the sniper-armed Aardvark, explains the presale’s performance so far. $SNORT’s presale has accumulated over $2M at this point since May with a starting token price of $0.09350000. The coin now sits at $0.0985, as it’s guaranteed to increase during the presale and after. Our analysts predict a $0.94 price point for $SNORT before the year’s end and $3.25 by 2030 , provided the project witnesses successful implementation and widespread adoption. Based on the current price of $0.0985, a potential $3.25 price point translates into an ROI of 3,200% for a 5-year investment. If you want to support the project, visit the presale page and buy your $SNORT today . 2. XRP ($XRP) – The Cost-Effective and Tool-Rich Blockchain for Businesses and Individuals With XRP ($XRP) booming in the charts, it was only natural that it would find its way on today’s list. XRP Ledger is the decentralized ecosystem that offers businesses and developers the tools they need to create value and solve problems. XRP comes with a variety of tools aimed at both novice and veteran developers, like SDKs, open-source libraries, and Nodes. With Ripple applying for banking license as well, XRP will also enter the banking system soon, providing banks with flexible solutions to managing their Central Bank Issued Digital Currencies (CBDS.) Between this and the House passing the GENIUS Act recently, XRP is likely rallying for another bull run. The token sits at $3.45 , but it’s under an 5% upwards pressure right now, so we expect it to break another ATH at $4 soon, probably today or tomorrow, if sentiment holds. If you want to invest, go to your preferred exchange and buy your $XRP while it’s hot. 3. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) – Bitcoin’s Layer 2 Upgrade Coming with Faster Transactions and Lower Fees Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is Bitcoin’s official Layer 2 upgrade that promises to achieve what the Lightning Network couldn’t: faster transactions and lower fees.

2025-07-18 10:29:28+00:00,XRP Price Prediction 2025 – Lark Davis Says $16 Possible After Breakout,"The post XRP Price Prediction 2025 – Lark Davis Says $16 Possible After Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Across social channels and trading floors, optimism around XRP is exploding. After breaking out of a long-standing consolidation pattern, XRP price soared past $3.50 this week — a 40% surge in just seven days. This rally comes on the back of institutional inflows, crypto-friendly U.S. regulations (like the GENIUS Act), and strong ETF momentum. XRP’s market cap jumped from $185 billion to over $215 billion in one day, while its 24-hour trading volume exceeded $23 billion, with heavy buying seen on Coinbase and Kraken. Lark Davis Says XRP Price Breakout Is “Juicy” In a recent podcast , crypto analyst Lark Davis dissected XRP’s explosive move. He noted that XRP had been coiling inside a symmetrical triangle since early 2024. On July 9, it finally broke out — a classic bullish continuation signal. “This breakout was juicy,” said Davis. “We’ve been watching XRP coil for months. Now it’s game on.” According to Davis, XRP has now flipped the critical $3 level from resistance to support. If this level holds on the retest, it could set the stage for new all-time highs. If not, XRP could dip back into the $2.60–$3 range before another leg up. XRP Price Targets: $4.10 to $7 in the Short Term? Davis highlighted a technical target of $4.10, based on the height of the triangle pattern. A Fibonacci extension also points to $4.68 as a likely top in the next move. Based on options data, there’s a 19% chance of XRP hitting $4.50 by September, and a 5% chance of touching $7. “If Bitcoin hits $150K,” Davis added, “then $4.50 or even $7 XRP becomes very realistic.” Could Ripple XRP Price Hit $16? From a macro perspective, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez revealed a breakout from a 7-year symmetrical triangle on XRP’s weekly chart. A confirmed weekly close above $3 could set XRP up for a full bull run . Potential price targets? $6, $8.96, and even $16.17, based on historical triangle breakouts. Martinez also cited a rare MVRV golden cross, which compares market value to realized value. The last time this signal flashed, XRP rallied 630%. If history repeats, XRP’s current momentum may be just the beginning. XRP Price Prediction 2025: What to Expect? Looking ahead, XRP could be one of the top altcoins to watch in the next bull cycle. With regulatory clarity, growing institutional support, and Ripple’s expanding ecosystem, many analysts believe XRP could climb significantly by 2025.

The post XRP Price Prediction 2025 – Lark Davis Says $16 Possible After Breakout appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Across social channels and trading floors, optimism around XRP is exploding. After breaking out of a long-standing consolidation pattern, XRP price soared past $3.50 this week — a 40% surge in just seven days. This rally comes on the back of institutional inflows, crypto-friendly U.S. regulations (like the GENIUS Act), and strong ETF momentum. XRP’s market cap jumped from $185 billion to over $215 billion in one day, while its 24-hour trading volume exceeded $23 billion, with heavy buying seen on Coinbase and Kraken. Lark Davis Says XRP Price Breakout Is “Juicy” In a recent podcast , crypto analyst Lark Davis dissected XRP’s explosive move. He noted that XRP had been coiling inside a symmetrical triangle since early 2024. On July 9, it finally broke out — a classic bullish continuation signal. “This breakout was juicy,” said Davis. “We’ve been watching XRP coil for months. Now it’s game on.” According to Davis, XRP has now flipped the critical $3 level from resistance to support. If this level holds on the retest, it could set the stage for new all-time highs. If not, XRP could dip back into the $2.60–$3 range before another leg up. XRP Price Targets: $4.10 to $7 in the Short Term? Davis highlighted a technical target of $4.10, based on the height of the triangle pattern. A Fibonacci extension also points to $4.68 as a likely top in the next move. Based on options data, there’s a 19% chance of XRP hitting $4.50 by September, and a 5% chance of touching $7. “If Bitcoin hits $150K,” Davis added, “then $4.50 or even $7 XRP becomes very realistic.” Could Ripple XRP Price Hit $16? From a macro perspective, on-chain analyst Ali Martinez revealed a breakout from a 7-year symmetrical triangle on XRP’s weekly chart. A confirmed weekly close above $3 could set XRP up for a full bull run . Potential price targets? $6, $8.96, and even $16.17, based on historical triangle breakouts. Martinez also cited a rare MVRV golden cross, which compares market value to realized value. The last time this signal flashed, XRP rallied 630%. If history repeats, XRP’s current momentum may be just the beginning. XRP Price Prediction 2025: What to Expect? Looking ahead, XRP could be one of the top altcoins to watch in the next bull cycle. With regulatory clarity, growing institutional support, and Ripple’s expanding ecosystem, many analysts believe XRP could climb significantly by 2025. Some models forecast XRP price prediction 2025 between $7 and $16, while more aggressive bulls predict $20+ in a full-blown crypto market explosion.

2025-07-18 10:30:05+00:00,Bitcoin Dominance is Losing Momentum FAST - Here''s The Top 3 Must-Have Altcoins For Double Digit Gains in Coming Months,"Bitcoin''s stronghold on the market is showing signs of weakening rapidly. As the spotlight shifts, attention turns to altcoins poised for impressive growth. Discover which digital currencies are predicted to make significant gains in the upcoming months. Explore the top three altcoins that could offer double-digit returns amidst the changing market landscape. Stellar Price Surge Amid Six-Month Slump Over the last month, Stellar experienced a strong uplift with prices gaining nearly 80%. A weekly surge of about 62.65% underscores recent momentum despite a modest six-month decline of roughly 3.6%. Price movements have been volatile, swinging sharply upward before settling into a narrower range. This activity highlights rapid gains over the short term paired with a longer-term pullback, reflecting traders’ cautious approach in the broader market environment. The current price hovers in a band between $0.21 and $0.28 with clear technical levels in sight. Immediate resistance stands around $0.31 while a second hurdle emerges near $0.38. On the downside, support is firmly positioned near $0.18 with a secondary level noted around $0.11. Bulls have taken charge in the last month, but the RSI over 84 suggests overbought conditions. Strategic plays may involve building positions near support while taking profits as resistance is approached. Cautious risk management will help traders navigate the market dynamics. Algorand''s Recent Market Shifts and Price Dynamics Algorand experienced a dramatic shift over the past month and half-year. In the six-month period, the coin saw a decline of 37.27% before rebounding with a notable one-month increase of 68.67%. The short-term momentum has been impressive, with a one-week gain of 53.26% reflecting robust buying interest. These movements indicate that the coin has faced periods of weakness followed by rapid recovery, highlighting its volatile performance. The current price sits between $0.16 and $0.21, with nearest resistance at $0.24 and a second resistance level at $0.29. Key support is observed at $0.13, with a secondary support at $0.07. Technical indicators show mixed signals, with an RSI of 84.46 suggesting overbought territory, while the Awesome Oscillator at 0.083 and Momentum Indicator at 0.12 indicate residual upward energy. Bulls have driven the price up, yet the high RSI hints at a potential corrective pullback. Traders may consider holding above support levels and taking profits near resistance. Caution is advised while monitoring trend confirmations in this bullish altcoin market. Hedera (HBAR): Recent Surge Amid Long-Term Correction and Key Levels HBAR recorded strong gains over the last month, climbing over 40% in a week and reaching a 57% increase overall. However, the six-month perspective shows a 35% decline, highlighting a contrasting long-term trend. Price movements have been between a low of $0.1235 and a high of $0.1815, reflecting short-term bullish sentiment despite the broader downtrend. This volatility led to sharp price rallies followed by corrections, balancing risk and potential rewards. Recent technical signals show an influx of buyers even as the longer-term outlook remains challenging. Currently, HBAR is trading within a narrow range between $0.1235 and $0.1815, with support at $0.0958 and resistance first observed near $0.21, followed by a higher resistance at $0.27. The Relative Strength Index around 79.40 suggests overbought conditions, though recent price increases indicate a short-term bullish outlook. Indicators like the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator imply sellers may emerge around key resistance levels. Traders should monitor for a hold above support for potential long positions or consider selling on rallies toward resistance, using incrementally adjusted targets and tight stop-losses to manage risk. Conclusion XLM , ALGO , and HBAR are showing strong potential for significant gains. These altcoins have unique features and developments that set them apart. XLM focuses on facilitating cross-border payments. ALGO prioritizes efficiency and speed in transactions. HBAR offers a unique consensus mechanism that promises faster and more secure transactions. Diversifying with these altcoins may enhance the chances of achieving high returns in the coming months. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

2025-07-18 10:40:18+00:00,Bitcoin Dormancy: Unveiling the Astonishing Truth of Lost BTC Supply,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Dormancy: Unveiling the Astonishing Truth of Lost BTC Supply Imagine a significant portion of the world’s most valuable digital asset, Bitcoin, simply sitting untouched for years, like ancient treasure buried deep. This isn’t just a fantasy; it’s a profound reality highlighted by recent data. Sentora, formerly known as IntoTheBlock, recently unveiled a startling statistic on X: over 30% of all Bitcoin (BTC) has remained dormant for five years or more. Even more astonishing, they estimate that a considerable 7.5% of the total supply is likely permanently lost. These figures paint a vivid picture of the enduring nature of Bitcoin and the long-term conviction of its holders, while also raising intriguing questions about its true circulating supply and future value. The Silent Majority: Understanding Bitcoin Dormancy What does it mean for Bitcoin to be “dormant”? In simple terms, it refers to BTC that has not moved from its wallet address for a specified period. Sentora’s revelation that over 30% of Bitcoin has been inactive for half a decade or more is a powerful indicator of several key trends within the crypto ecosystem. This isn’t just about forgotten wallets; it speaks volumes about the “HODL” philosophy – a term born from a misspelling of “hold” during a moment of market volatility, now a mantra for long-term investors. Deep HODLers: Many early adopters and conviction-driven investors purchased Bitcoin years ago and have simply held onto it, weathering market storms with unwavering belief in its long-term potential. They see Bitcoin not just as a speculative asset, but as a store of value, a digital gold, or even a future global reserve currency. Institutional Cold Storage: As institutional adoption grows, large entities, funds, and corporations acquire significant amounts of BTC and store it in highly secure, often offline (cold) wallets. These holdings are typically not intended for frequent trading, contributing to the dormant supply. Forgotten Wallets/Keys: Sadly, a portion of this dormant supply undoubtedly belongs to individuals who have lost access to their private keys, forgotten passwords, or whose hardware wallets have failed without backups. This leads us to the even more permanent category of lost Bitcoin. The sheer volume of Bitcoin dormancy underscores a unique characteristic of this asset: its ability to attract and retain a dedicated base of long-term holders, differentiating it from more volatile, frequently traded digital assets. The Unseen Impact: Exploring the Phenomenon of Lost Bitcoin While dormancy suggests inactivity, “lost” Bitcoin implies a permanent inability to access those coins. Sentora’s estimate of over 7.5% of the total BTC supply being permanently lost is a sobering reminder of the unforgiving nature of self-custody in the digital realm. This figure, though an estimate, has significant implications for the actual circulating supply of Bitcoin. How does Bitcoin get lost? The reasons are varied and often tragic: Forgotten Private Keys: The most common reason. Bitcoin’s security relies on a unique private key. If this key is lost, forgotten, or destroyed without a backup, the associated BTC becomes irretrievable. Early miners or casual users who acquired small amounts of BTC years ago might not have realized the importance of secure key management. Hardware Wallet Failures: Physical devices holding private keys can malfunction, be damaged, or simply disappear. Without a properly recorded seed phrase, the coins are lost. Accidental Transfers: Sending BTC to an incorrect or non-existent address can lead to permanent loss, as transactions on the blockchain are irreversible. The “Satoshi” Wallets: A portion of the lost Bitcoin is believed to be held in the very first wallets mined by Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. These coins have never moved, and it’s widely speculated they will remain untouched, effectively lost to the active supply. The phenomenon of lost Bitcoin effectively reduces the true maximum circulating supply, making the existing accessible supply even scarcer. This has profound implications for its long-term valuation and market dynamics. Why Does BTC Supply Matter? Scarcity and Value Bitcoin’s fundamental design is rooted in scarcity. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed indefinitely, Bitcoin has a hard cap of 21 million coins. This fixed supply, combined with its programmatic issuance schedule (halving events), is a core tenet of its value proposition. When we factor in dormant and lost coins, the effective circulating BTC supply available for active trading and use is significantly lower than the total mined supply. Consider these points: Deflationary Pressure: A reduced effective supply, coupled with increasing demand, inherently creates deflationary pressure, potentially driving up the price of the remaining active coins. Digital Gold Narrative: The scarcity aspect strengthens Bitcoin’s narrative as “digital gold.” ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-dormancy-lost-btc/,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|FIAT,Crypto News|$BTC|BITCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Market Analysis,BTC,"Bitcoin Dormancy: Unveiling the Astonishing Truth of Lost BTC Supply.

2025-07-18 10:49:02+00:00,Will the Crypto Bullrun Continue or Is a Weekend Pullback Coming?,"The post Will the Crypto Bullrun Continue or Is a Weekend Pullback Coming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market continues its bullish expansion, this time influenced by strong institutional inflows and regulatory clarity. The total market cap has breached $3.91 trillion, marking a significant technical breakout. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index sits at 71, indicating rising optimism yet possibly inclining toward overheated conditions. That being said, as Bitcoin consolidates and altcoins catch the trend, the key question remains: will the crypto bullrun continue, or is a weekend pullback brewing? Join me as I take you through the specifics and an overview of what could be in store. Total Crypto Market Cap: Cooling Signs Within a Strong Trend? The 4-hour chart of the total crypto market cap I’ve shared reveals an uptrend, but surfacing short-term exhaustion. The market is currently pressing against the upper Bollinger Band near ~$3.88T, indicating a stretched move that often comes before short-term corrections. It is evident that the market is approaching the overbought territory, with the RSI at 68.70. That being said, if a pullback occurs, the mid-Bollinger Band at ~$3.73T and the lower band near $3.58T will serve as strong support zones. Despite this short-term caution, the macro trend remains fairly bullish. The breakout above $3.9T is a strong signal that the business is ready to challenge higher valuations. This is especially if the key levels hold firm ground over the weekend. Buy-the-Dip Playbook Still in Motion?

The post Will the Crypto Bullrun Continue or Is a Weekend Pullback Coming? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market continues its bullish expansion, this time influenced by strong institutional inflows and regulatory clarity. The total market cap has breached $3.91 trillion, marking a significant technical breakout. Talking about sentiments, the Fear & Greed Index sits at 71, indicating rising optimism yet possibly inclining toward overheated conditions. That being said, as Bitcoin consolidates and altcoins catch the trend, the key question remains: will the crypto bullrun continue, or is a weekend pullback brewing? Join me as I take you through the specifics and an overview of what could be in store. Total Crypto Market Cap: Cooling Signs Within a Strong Trend? The 4-hour chart of the total crypto market cap I’ve shared reveals an uptrend, but surfacing short-term exhaustion. The market is currently pressing against the upper Bollinger Band near ~$3.88T, indicating a stretched move that often comes before short-term corrections. It is evident that the market is approaching the overbought territory, with the RSI at 68.70. That being said, if a pullback occurs, the mid-Bollinger Band at ~$3.73T and the lower band near $3.58T will serve as strong support zones. Despite this short-term caution, the macro trend remains fairly bullish. The breakout above $3.9T is a strong signal that the business is ready to challenge higher valuations. This is especially if the key levels hold firm ground over the weekend. Buy-the-Dip Playbook Still in Motion? Popular analyst Michael van de Poppe highlights that when “Bitcoin consolidates, altcoins start firing off”. He believes that we’ll have some harsh corrections, and those would be great buy-the-dip opportunities. This aligns with what’s playing out now, as BTC is pausing below $120k, altcoins are showing relative strength.

2025-07-18 10:55:18+00:00,Coinsilium Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Unlocking Future Value with 112 BTC Holdings,"BitcoinWorld Coinsilium Group’s Strategic Bitcoin Accumulation: Unlocking Future Value with 112 BTC Holdings In a significant move that underscores its unwavering commitment to the digital asset space, Coinsilium Group has announced a fresh acquisition of 10.25 BTC. This latest purchase elevates their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 112 BTC, signaling a robust and confident stance in the evolving cryptocurrency market. For those closely watching corporate movements in the blockchain sector, this development from Coinsilium Group Forza! offers compelling insights into strategic treasury management and the long-term potential seen in Bitcoin. Coinsilium Group’s Bold Move: Why More Bitcoin? Coinsilium Group is not just another company dabbling in crypto; it’s a well-established blockchain venture builder and investor with a deep understanding of the industry’s intricacies. Their decision to further accumulate Bitcoin is far from impulsive. It reflects a calculated strategy rooted in several key beliefs: Bitcoin as a Store of Value: In an era of increasing inflation concerns and economic uncertainty, Bitcoin has emerged as a compelling digital alternative to traditional safe-haven assets like gold. Its decentralized nature and finite supply of 21 million coins make it an attractive hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Long-Term Growth Potential: Despite its notorious volatility, Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable long-term growth. Companies like Coinsilium Group are positioning themselves to capitalize on this potential appreciation, viewing BTC as a strategic asset for future capital gains. Alignment with Core Business: As a blockchain-focused entity, holding a significant amount of the premier cryptocurrency strengthens Coinsilium’s position and credibility within the digital asset ecosystem. It’s a tangible demonstration of their belief in the very technology they help build and invest in. The company’s mantra, ‘Forza!’, truly encapsulates this forward-driving momentum and confidence in their strategic decisions within the dynamic world of digital assets. Understanding the Significance of Bitcoin Holdings in Corporate Strategy The trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets has gained considerable traction over the past few years. What drives this shift, and why is Coinsilium Group’s substantial Bitcoin holdings noteworthy? Traditionally, corporate treasuries primarily held cash, short-term government bonds, or other low-risk, low-yield assets. However, with interest rates near zero and concerns about currency debasement, many forward-thinking companies are exploring alternatives. Bitcoin offers: Diversification: Bitcoin can provide a degree of diversification away from traditional financial assets, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk. Inflation Hedge: Its fixed supply and growing adoption make it a potential hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Investor Confidence: For some investors, a company’s strategic allocation to Bitcoin signals innovation, adaptability, and a belief in the future of digital finance. While companies like MicroStrategy have made headlines for their aggressive Bitcoin accumulation, Coinsilium’s consistent and growing BTC position, albeit on a different scale, solidifies its commitment to this emerging asset class within its own operational and investment framework. The Impact of Strategic BTC Acquisition on Portfolio Diversification Every strategic BTC acquisition , like Coinsilium’s recent 10.25 BTC addition, plays a crucial role in shaping a company’s overall financial health and future prospects. For a company like Coinsilium, which is deeply embedded in the blockchain space, this move enhances its portfolio diversification in several ways: Exposure to a Leading Asset: Bitcoin is the undisputed leader in the cryptocurrency market. Holding it provides direct exposure to the performance of the broader crypto market, often seen as a bellwether for the entire digital asset industry. Enhanced Liquidity: Bitcoin is one of the most liquid cryptocurrencies, allowing for relatively easy entry and exit from positions, which is important for treasury management. Strategic Reserve: Beyond being an investment, Bitcoin can serve as a strategic reserve, offering flexibility in funding future ventures or navigating market fluctuations within the crypto ecosystem itself. This approach highlights a sophisticated understanding of how digital assets can be integrated into a comprehensive financial strategy, moving beyond speculative trading to long-term value creation. Navigating the Future: Coinsilium’s Crypto Investment Strategy Coinsilium Group’s recent actions provide a clear window into their broader crypto investment strategy .

Rapid liquidation of short positions and bullish sentiment in the options market pushed the price above $3,600 as of Friday. Ethereum Short Liquidations Push Price Above $3,600: Experts Call It a Structural Transformation ETH, which has gained over 20 percent on a weekly basis, could test the $4,000 level by the July 25 futures options expiry, according to analysts. Dr. Sean Dawson, research director at onchain options platform Derive.xyz, described this upward move as a “structural regime shift,” saying, “Investors are aggressively positioning for a rapid rise to $4,000.” According to Coinglass data, approximately $136 million worth of ETH short positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, causing an upward price squeeze. Approximately 25% of ETH options traded on the Derive platform since Wednesday are focused on $3,000-$4,000 call options due July 25. Eight percent of open positions for the same period are positioned at $4,000. Dawson estimates a 14% probability of ETH closing above $4,000 by the end of July and a 27% probability of it closing above $5,000 by the end of 2025. Bitcoin is also participating in this rally, but this rally belongs to Ethereum. The technical landscape, options flows, and liquidations signal a structural shift in market positioning. Regulatory developments in the US also contributed to the overall market rally. The total crypto market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion for the first time. This development was bolstered by the bipartisan GENIUS Act, which was sent to the president for signature, and the Senate''s introduction of the Clarity Act. These regulations are widely seen by investors as paving the way for clearer cryptocurrency regulations in the US. Wall Street''s appetite for crypto funds has also strengthened. BRN senior analyst Valentin Fournier noted that Ethereum led the way. According to the data, there were net inflows of $602 million into Ether spot ETFs and $523 million into Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Consolidates, New Highs on the Horizon Bitcoin remained sideways below $120,000 during this period. According to Glassnode data, BTC has reached a point that has historically acted as resistance, rising one standard deviation above its short-term investor cost average.

Over the last 12 months, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency grew by a mere 5.6%, frustrating investors who once saw it as a market leader. However, momentum has shifted in recent weeks. In the last 30 days, ETH has jumped by 44.2% to reach $3,640.83. In just the past 24 hours, the price surged 5.3%, indicating a strong short-term trend reversal and renewed investor confidence. Ethereum Price Gains Momentum: Key Metrics Ethereum’s recent performance further supports the bullish outlook. At the start of this month, ETH was priced at just $2,404.14. Since then, the asset has surged by over 50.58%. In the last 14 days alone, ETH has gained 42.3%, and in the past week, it rose by 21.7%. This rapid upward movement is signaling a potential breakout, especially if market conditions remain favorable. Analyst Predicts Ethereum Price Could Soar to $20,000 Fueling this renewed optimism is a bold forecast by well-known crypto chart analyst Colin Talks Crypto. In a recent post on X , Colin predicted that Ethereum could hit $15,000 to $20,000 in the upcoming crypto bull run. According to him, long-term chart trends support this target, showing a consistent upward trajectory that aligns with previous bull cycles. As of now, ETH is still trading 25.22% below its all-time high of $4,868.80, which was achieved on November 9, 2021, driven by the NFT frenzy, DeFi boom, and anticipation around the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. Colin’s projection suggests Ethereum could more than triple or even quadruple its ATH if the market rallies as expected. Ethereum vs Bitcoin: Which Will Perform Better in the Bull Market? Colin also compared Ethereum’s potential growth with that of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin’s all-time high was $69,000, the analyst expects BTC to climb 2x to 3x in the next bull market, suggesting a target range between $138,000 and $207,000 . .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Will the Crypto Bullrun Continue or Is a Weekend Pullback Coming? , Bitcoin’s market cap currently sits at over $2.37 trillion, significantly higher than Ethereum’s $436.8 billion. This market cap difference makes Ethereum more volatile, meaning it can rise faster during a bull run, but it may also fall harder when the market turns bearish. According to Colin, this volatility could allow ETH to outperform BTC in the near term, although investors should remain cautious about post-bull cycle corrections. What’s Next for Ethereum? As the market heats up and the crypto community begins positioning for the next major cycle, all eyes are on Ethereum’s price action. If Colin’s predictions play out, ETH could break all previous records and become one of the most profitable assets of the bull run. For now, traders and long-term holders alike are watching closely.

After breaching $3,600, the largest altcoin is $3,700 next while riding a wave of institutional inflows, whale accumulation, and renewed retail FOMO. Ether is now outperforming Bitcoin, sparking a sentiment of the official start of altseason. With a $416 billion valuation, Ethereum has entered the list of the top 30 global assets. ETH price is running up by 20% over the last 7 days as BTC witnesses a halt at $120K after smashing fresh ATHs. Whales go after Ethereum On-chain data shows two mysterious whale wallets , 0x35fb and 0x9684, scooped up 206,415 ETH (worth $745 million) in just the past week. 0x35fb withdrew 103,274 ETH (worth $372.8 million) from Kraken over 9 days, while 0x9684 pulled 103,141 ETH (worth $372.3 million) from FalconX.

2025-07-18 11:10:18+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Drop: Alarming Plunge Below $119,000 Ignites Market Fears","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Drop: Alarming Plunge Below $119,000 Ignites Market Fears The cryptocurrency world awoke to a stark reality as Bitcoin (BTC), the leading digital asset, experienced a significant downturn, falling sharply below the crucial $119,000 threshold. According to real-time monitoring from Bitcoin World, BTC is currently trading at $118,973.48 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden Bitcoin price drop has sent ripples across the entire digital asset landscape, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to question the immediate future of the market. What factors are contributing to this alarming dip, and what does it signify for the broader crypto ecosystem? Let’s delve deeper into the unfolding events and their potential implications. What Triggered This Bitcoin Price Drop? Understanding the catalysts behind any significant market movement is paramount. The recent Bitcoin price drop below $119,000 is likely a confluence of several factors, both macroeconomic and crypto-specific. While no single event can be pinpointed as the sole cause, a combination of these elements often creates the perfect storm for market corrections. Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, such as persistent inflation, rising interest rates from central banks, and fears of a looming recession, often push investors away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies towards safer havens. The tightening of monetary policies worldwide can reduce liquidity in financial markets, impacting crypto valuations. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased regulatory pressure from governments across the globe continues to be a persistent concern. News or rumors of stricter regulations, bans, or taxation policies can trigger widespread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) among investors, leading to sell-offs. Large-Scale Liquidations and Profit-Taking: In volatile markets, large holders, often referred to as ‘whales,’ might initiate significant sell orders to secure profits, especially after periods of upward momentum. Such large transactions can cascade, triggering further selling as other investors react to the sudden price decline. Technical Breakdown: From a technical analysis perspective, the $119,000 level might have been a critical support zone. A breach of such a key level often triggers automated sell orders and can signal a continuation of the downtrend for traders who follow technical indicators. Market Sentiment and FUD: Negative news, even if unverified, or general pessimism surrounding the crypto space can quickly erode investor confidence. Social media trends and mainstream media narratives can amplify fear, leading to panic selling. Decoding the Current BTC Market Analysis To truly grasp the significance of Bitcoin’s recent decline, a comprehensive BTC market analysis is essential. This involves examining trading volumes, market capitalization, and key technical indicators that provide insights into market health and potential future movements. Key Market Indicators: Trading Volume: A high volume accompanying a price drop often indicates strong conviction behind the selling pressure, suggesting a more significant trend rather than a temporary fluctuation. Conversely, a low-volume drop might suggest less fundamental selling pressure. Market Capitalization: Bitcoin’s market cap has naturally decreased with its price, impacting its dominance ratio relative to other cryptocurrencies. A declining dominance can sometimes signal a shift in investor interest towards altcoins, though during major corrections, altcoins often suffer even more. Fear & Greed Index: This popular sentiment indicator typically plunges into the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone during significant price corrections. A low score suggests that investors are highly fearful, which historically has sometimes presented buying opportunities for contrarian investors. Technical Levels to Watch: The $119,000 level, now broken, transforms from a support to a resistance level. Traders will be keenly watching for the next potential support zones where buying interest might emerge. Historically, previous resistance levels or psychological round numbers often act as new support. For example: Metric Pre-Drop Value (Approx.) Current Value (Approx.) Significance Bitcoin Price $120,000+ $118,973.48 Breach of key psychological/technical support. Market Cap Higher Lower Reflects overall market value decline. Fear & Greed Index Neutral/Greed Extreme Fear Indicates widespread investor apprehension. A thorough BTC market analysis also considers the correlation with traditional financial markets. Often, Bitcoin moves in tandem with tech stocks or broader equity indices, especially during periods of high macroeconomic uncertainty.

Imagine a company, rooted in the conventional stock exchange, making a massive leap into the future of finance. That’s exactly what Thumzup has done, signaling a significant shift in corporate treasury strategies and cementing its position at the forefront of institutional crypto adoption. This isn’t just about holding a few digital tokens; it’s a strategic embrace of a new financial paradigm, authorized by its Board of Directors to the tune of a quarter of a billion dollars in cryptocurrencies. Unpacking Thumzup’s Bold Digital Asset Strategy: What Does $250 Million Really Mean? The core of Thumzup’s recent announcement, delivered via PR Newswire, revolves around a staggering authorization: its Board of Directors has given the green light to hold up to $250 million in cryptocurrencies . This isn’t a speculative venture into a single digital currency; it’s a meticulously planned expansion of their digital asset strategy , which initially began with a focus solely on Bitcoin (BTC). The evolution of their approach is evident in the newly approved roster of digital assets, designed to diversify their crypto treasury beyond just the king of cryptocurrencies. This expanded list now includes: Ether (ETH): The native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, powering decentralized applications and smart contracts. Solana (SOL): Known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, a rising star in the blockchain ecosystem. Ripple (XRP): A digital asset designed for fast, low-cost international payments. Dogecoin (DOGE): The popular meme coin, which has garnered significant community support and mainstream attention. Litecoin (LTC): Often referred to as “digital silver,” a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. USDC: A stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, offering stability within the volatile crypto market. This diversification underscores a nuanced understanding of the crypto market, aiming to balance potential growth with some level of stability through USDC. Furthermore, this bold move builds upon a previously disclosed, equally ambitious plan: the company had already committed to allowing up to 90% of its liquid assets to be held in Bitcoin (BTC). This indicates a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value and a hedge against inflation, positioning it as a foundational element of their overall financial strategy. It’s a clear signal that Thumzup views these digital assets not just as an investment opportunity, but as a legitimate and significant component of their corporate balance sheet, akin to traditional financial instruments. Why the Shift? Understanding the Crypto Treasury Imperative Why would a Nasdaq-listed firm like Thumzup, operating in the traditional branding and marketing space, pivot so decisively towards digital assets? The decision to authorize a substantial crypto treasury strategy is not made lightly. It reflects a growing trend among forward-thinking corporations to re-evaluate traditional financial paradigms in the face of evolving global economic conditions. Several compelling factors are driving this shift: Inflation Hedge: With global inflation concerns rising, many companies are seeking alternative assets that can preserve or even grow purchasing power. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” is increasingly seen as a robust hedge against fiat currency debasement due to its fixed supply. Diversification of Assets: Traditional treasury strategies often rely heavily on cash, short-term government bonds, and other low-yield instruments. Introducing cryptocurrencies offers a new avenue for diversification, potentially enhancing overall portfolio returns while mitigating risks associated with over-reliance on a single asset class. Growth Potential: The cryptocurrency market, despite its volatility, has demonstrated unprecedented growth over the past decade. Companies are looking to capitalize on this growth potential, viewing strategic allocations as a way to boost shareholder value. Embracing Innovation and Future-Proofing: For a branding and social media marketing firm like Thumzup, being at the forefront of technological innovation is crucial. Embracing digital assets signals a progressive mindset, aligning the company with emerging technologies and potentially attracting a new generation of talent and clients who are digitally native. Yield Opportunities: Beyond simply holding, some digital assets offer opportunities for yield generation through staking, lending, or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, though this often comes with higher risk.

2025-07-18 11:26:15+00:00,"Ripple (XRP) Price Explosion, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) Potential, and More: Bits Recap July 18","TL;DR XRP surged by 60% in the last month, hitting a new historic peak. A nalysts predict further gains, with targets up to $10. SHIB rose 30% in two weeks, yet 45% of holders remain in the red. Market observers see more upside based on certain chart patterns. BTC dipped to $119K after peaking at $123K, but strong ETF inflows and whale activity suggest the bull run may continue. XRP Reached Uncharted Territory Ripple’s XRP has been on the crest of the wave recently, with its price tapping an all-time high (on most exchanges and data aggregators) of over $3.60. The asset’s investors had to wait more than seven years for this achievement since the previous peak of approximately $3.40 was registered at the start of 2018. Meanwhile, XRP’s market capitalization surged well above $200 billion, solidifying the token as the third-largest cryptocurrency and widening the gap with the fourth, Tether’s USDT.

Market observers see more upside based on certain chart patterns. BTC dipped to $119K after peaking at $123K, but strong ETF inflows and whale activity suggest the bull run may continue. XRP Reached Uncharted Territory Ripple’s XRP has been on the crest of the wave recently, with its price tapping an all-time high (on most exchanges and data aggregators) of over $3.60. The asset’s investors had to wait more than seven years for this achievement since the previous peak of approximately $3.40 was registered at the start of 2018. Meanwhile, XRP’s market capitalization surged well above $200 billion, solidifying the token as the third-largest cryptocurrency and widening the gap with the fourth, Tether’s USDT.

2025-07-18 11:28:19+00:00,Trump Eyes Executive Order to Allow Crypto in 401(k) Retirement Plans,"US President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order that could open the doors for American 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets, including crypto, metals, and infrastructure-focused funds. According to a report by the Financial Times, the executive order could be signed as early as this week, citing three individuals familiar with the discussions. If signed, the order would direct US regulatory agencies to examine how 401(k) plans can begin investing in digital assets and identify any legal or regulatory barriers that need to be addressed to facilitate these investments. The move could significantly diversify the options available to American workers planning for retirement, shifting from the traditional focus on stocks, bonds, and mutual funds to include emerging asset classes like cryptocurrencies. In a recent statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai clarified that no decision should be considered official unless announced directly by President Trump. Desai emphasized Trump’s commitment to ensuring economic prosperity for everyday Americans while safeguarding their financial future. Crypto in Retirement Accounts Gains Momentum This development follows the US Labor Department’s decision in May to rescind guidance from the Biden administration that had restricted the inclusion of digital assets in 401(k) plans. The shift comes amid increasing institutional interest in crypto within retirement accounts. In April, Fidelity, managing $5.9 trillion in assets, introduced a new retirement account product allowing Americans to invest in cryptocurrencies as part of their long-term savings strategies. Traditionally, 401(k) plans have focused on investments in mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds, with the US 401(k) market holding approximately $8.9 trillion in assets across more than 715,000 plans as of September 2024. Governments Exploring the Idea States are also showing interest in crypto investments for retirement portfolios . In March, lawmakers in North Carolina proposed bills that would enable the state’s treasurer to allocate up to 5% of certain state funds into Bitcoin and other digital assets. Globally, pension schemes in the United Kingdom and Japan have also explored the possibility of adding Bitcoin to their retirement portfolios, highlighting a growing trend toward the inclusion of digital assets in long-term investment strategies.

2025-07-18 11:30:18+00:00,"Ethereum Price Explodes: $136M Shorts Liquidated, $4K ETH Bets Surge","BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price Explodes: $136M Shorts Liquidated, $4K ETH Bets Surge The cryptocurrency market is buzzing, and all eyes are on Ethereum (ETH). Recently, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization experienced a significant surge, pushing its Ethereum price past the $3,600 mark. This upward movement wasn’t just organic; it was dramatically amplified by the liquidation of over $136 million in Ethereum short positions. This pivotal event has ignited a fresh wave of optimism, particularly among options traders who are now placing substantial bets on ETH reaching $4,000 by July 25. What’s driving this newfound confidence, and what does it mean for the future of Ethereum? What Triggered the Massive Ethereum Shorts Liquidation? To understand the recent price action, it’s essential to grasp the concept of ‘short selling’ in the crypto market. When traders ‘short’ an asset like Ethereum, they are essentially betting its price will fall. They borrow ETH, sell it at the current market price, and hope to buy it back at a lower price later to return it to the lender, profiting from the difference. However, if the price moves against their bet and starts to rise significantly, these short positions can face ‘liquidation.’ This happens when the value of the borrowed asset increases to a point where the short seller’s collateral is no longer sufficient to cover potential losses. Automated systems then force-close these positions, buying back the ETH to cover the loan. This forced buying creates intense upward pressure, often leading to a rapid price increase known as a ‘short squeeze.’ The recent liquidation of over $136 million in Ethereum shorts acted as a powerful catalyst, propelling ETH’s value higher. This massive unwind of bearish bets indicates that a significant number of traders were caught off guard by Ethereum’s resilience and upward momentum, contributing directly to its impressive climb above $3,600. Are ETH Options Traders Betting on a $4,000 Surge? Beyond the short squeeze, another fascinating development is the surge in activity within the ETH options market. Options contracts give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset at a specific price (the ‘strike price’) on or before a certain date (the ‘expiry date’). Currently, there’s a notable concentration of call options (bets on price going up) with a strike price of $4,000, set to expire around July 25. This indicates a strong belief among a segment of sophisticated traders that Ethereum is poised to hit this significant psychological and technical level within the next few weeks. Why are they so confident? Implied Volatility: High demand for these call options often drives up their premium, reflecting increased expectations of price swings. Market Sentiment: The options market provides a window into the collective sentiment of large institutional and professional traders, who are often more informed about upcoming catalysts. Strategic Positioning: Traders might be positioning themselves ahead of anticipated positive news or major market events. This concentrated betting suggests a bullish outlook, signaling that market participants see more than just a temporary bounce for Ethereum. How Are Crypto ETF Inflows Fueling Ethereum’s Ascent? A major underlying factor contributing to the positive sentiment around Ethereum is the increasing anticipation of spot Crypto ETF approvals. Following the immense success and capital inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year, the focus has shifted to Ethereum. Recent regulatory progress, particularly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has significantly boosted hopes for a spot Ethereum ETF. An ETF provides a regulated, accessible pathway for traditional investors – including large institutions, pension funds, and retail investors – to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This removes complexities related to custody, security, and regulatory compliance, making ETH a more attractive asset for a broader range of investors. The potential for massive inflows from institutional capital, mirroring or even surpassing what Bitcoin ETFs experienced, is a powerful driver for Ethereum’s valuation. Analysts believe that the mere prospect of these ETFs launching is already being priced into the market, positioning Ethereum for substantial future gains as more traditional finance money seeks exposure to the digital asset space. What’s Next for ETH Price Prediction ? Beyond $4,000? With the current momentum, the question on many investors’ minds is: what’s the next target for Ethereum price prediction ? While $4,000 is a significant short-term target, many analysts believe that Ethereum’s long-term potential extends far beyond this level, especially given its fundamental strength and ongoing developments.

He highlighted an ascending channel that the foremost meme coin needs to break above to witness this massive uptrend. Dogecoin Price Eyes 60% Rally To $0.4 In a TradingView post, MMBTtrader predicted that the Dogecoin price could rally to as high as $0.4 once it breaks above the ascending channel at around $0.243. He claimed that with good volume, the market will pump nonstop. The analyst is confident that this will happen, declaring that the breakout will be huge and that a 60% rally is a likely target. Related Reading: This Fibonacci Level Puts The Dogecoin Price Above $10 This Cycle MMBTtrader also stated that the market would be extremely bullish if the Dogecoin price should rally to this $0.4 target. He predicted that the $0.75 and $1 price levels will be in sight once DOGE reaches $0.4. A rally to these $0.75 and $1 targets would mark new all-time highs (ATHs) for the leading meme coin. DOGE has sometimes lagged behind other meme coins. However, the crypto analyst expects the Dogecoin price to pump massively this time and be “a leader of memes for weeks.” The meme coin looks to be already leading the way, standing out as one of the top gainers during the current crypto market rally. The Dogecoin price has broken above the psychological $0.2 level and looks ready to reach new highs in the coming weeks, with a break above the $0.42 level, MMBTtrader highlighted. Fundamentals, such as the potential launch of Dogecoin ETFs, could serve as a tailwind for higher prices. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas predict there is a 90% chance the SEC will approve these funds this year. Only A Matter Of Time For DOGE In an X post, crypto analyst Kevin Capital remarked that it is only a matter of time before the Dogecoin price makes its move back up to between $0.28 and $0.30 and then “well beyond.” He added that as long as the Bitcoin price holds up and continues to show strength, this move for DOGE should come sooner rather than later.

2025-07-18 11:30:26+00:00,"Bitcoin And Crypto De Minimis Tax Exemption Backed By Trump, Says White House","The White House on Thursday confirmed that President Donald Trump remains committed to carving out a de minimis tax safe‑harbor for everyday Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency payments, a policy his economic team believes will let digital money function “as simply as buying a cup of coffee.” Trump Backs Bitcoin And Crypto Tax Exemption Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt made the remarks during the daily briefing after Bitcoin Magazine correspondent Frank Corva pressed the administration on whether the president still stands behind the $600 threshold he first floated earlier this year. “The president did signal his support for a de minimis exemption for crypto, and the administration continues to be in support of that,” Leavitt said, adding that the Treasury and Congress are “exploring legislative solutions to accomplish that.” Leavitt argued the measure would remove the micro‑accounting burden that currently forces users to calculate capital‑gains tax every time they spend appreciated digital assets. “Right now that cannot happen, but with a de minimis exemption perhaps it could in the future,” she told reporters, framing the carve‑out as critical to Trump’s pledge to make the United States “the crypto capital of the world.” The exemption is expected to surface in follow‑on tax legislation later this year, but it already has momentum on Capitol Hill. The House on Wednesday advanced the bipartisan Genius Act , the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoins, and a separate bill that would write a de minimis standard directly into the Internal Revenue Code. The Genius Act cleared the chamber 308‑122 and is scheduled for a Rose Garden signing ceremony on Friday, Leavitt said. Trump’s push picks up a debate that began in 2022, when senators Pat Toomey and Kyrsten Sinema introduced the Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act to exempt gains of up to $200 per transaction—far below the $600 ceiling now backed by the White House. Industry groups such as Coin Center and the Blockchain Association have long argued that parity with foreign‑currency rules is essential for retail crypto adoption. Leavitt also reiterated that the president “opposes a central‑bank digital currency,” noting Trump’s January executive order barring the Federal Reserve from issuing one and endorsing congressional efforts to codify that ban. She portrayed the combined package—stablecoin oversight, securities‑clarity rules, an anti‑CBDC statute and the forthcoming de minimis fix—as “a regulatory foundation that will unleash American leadership in digital assets for decades.” A $600 exclusion would dramatically reduce friction for low‑value crypto spending while leaving large transfers fully taxable, striking a balance between usability and revenue protection. Whether the final threshold lands at $200, $600 or is indexed for inflation will hinge on Senate negotiations later this summer, but the White House endorsement gives the measure its strongest tail‑wind yet.

Despite this, trading activity on the Hyperliquid platform notably increased, especially in major assets like BTC. This surge in volume helped HYPE reverse course mid-April, triggering a parabolic move. By mid-June, HYPE reached $45.75, breaking resistance levels seamlessly. However, geopolitical tensions, specifically the U.S. threat to Iran on June 17, led to a broad market pullback. HYPE followed, dipping to $32 by late June. A quick rebound occurred on June 21 – 22 as BTC dropped to $98K. Traders on Hyperliquid seized the dip, reviving platform volume and driving HYPE higher. HYPE Price Targets July 2025 As BTC reclaimed an all-time high of $123,231, HYPE hit a new ATH at $49.80, too. Precisely, from June last week to July 18th, HYPE has seen a nearly 50% rise and could aim higher in the rest of July. This marked a more than 1300% gain from its ATL eight months ago, with HYPE now ranked 11th by market cap. Momentum has shifted strongly in favor of bulls. If HYPE clears the $50 psychological level in July, then it could reach a new level in its price discovery phase. However, if BTC witnesses profit booking and reaches June’s high, then HYPE could reach $39. If sentiment weakens further, then the $35 support will be crucial. Falling below this could bring $32 into play as the next major level. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HYPE July Target 2025 $32 $39 $50+ Hyperliquid Price Projection 2025 (H2) Data from Dune Analytics suggests that Hyperliquid’s perpetual trading volume is increasing steadily in 2025, even outpacing Binance in growth patterns. This indicates rising adoption and user migration toward Hyperliquid. Given the sustained rise in volume, high trader interest, and BTC’s bullish trend, HYPE could see further upside. Also, developer activity and developer counts has increased too, which confirms fundamental strength growing behind the scenes. Therefore, a push past $50 may position it to reach or even exceed the $80 level before 2026. If this momentum carries forward, HYPE could also enter the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.

2025-07-18 11:41:26+00:00,Dogecoin Price Prediction: Is a 380% Rally to $1 Now Possible?,"The post Dogecoin Price Prediction: Is a 380% Rally to $1 Now Possible? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Great news for all the memecoin enthusiasts out there. With a sharp breakout from a long-term pattern and a $500 million institutional push, Dogecoin is suddenly back in focus, and the $1 mark might not be far off. This is a rally to watch! Strong Breakout Signals New Rally After spending nearly 10 months inside a symmetrical triangle pattern, Dogecoin has finally broken out and the price action is already reflecting that shift. DOGE surged 14% today, July 18, and is trading around $0.248. Over the past week, it’s up 23%, marking its strongest weekly close in months. If the breakout follows the full height of the triangle pattern, analysts say DOGE could see a 380% rally, which would take it to the long-awaited $1 level. Momentum indicators are also supporting the bullish view. The RSI has moved above 50, suggesting growing buying strength. Meanwhile, the AO indicator has turned green, which is a sign that bearish pressure is fading, even though it’s still below zero. Bit Origin Puts $500 Million Behind DOGE Backing this technical breakout is a major move from Bit Origin , a Nasdaq-listed crypto firm. The company has secured funding to launch a $500 million Dogecoin treasury strategy. Growing institutional interest is always a great sign! Part of the funds will go toward accumulating DOGE, while the rest will be used to support growth within the Dogecoin ecosystem. Today’s price action also saw DOGE break through the key $0.23 resistance. If the current momentum holds, the next levels to watch are $0.28 and $0.30. DOGE ETF Buzz Adds to Momentum Another factor pushing Dogecoin forward is the rising speculation around a spot DOGE ETF. According to Polymarket , the odds of an ETF approval have jumped to 80%, with the next SEC decision expected in September 2025. The ETF hype has played a big role in earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum rallies. If DOGE gets similar approval, it could open the door to wider adoption and fresh capital. Analysts Expect More Upside Soon Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) also shared a DOGE chart on X , pointing to a breakout from a long-term falling trendline. He wrote: “Only a matter of time before #Dogecoin makes its move back up to the .28-.30 level and then well beyond.” #Dogecoin #DOGE https://t.co/Ad2qsZlEVb pic.twitter.com/h6RGRZ2hbt — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) July 18, 2025 He also highlighted multiple retests of the trendline over the past few months, which is a pattern often seen before strong rallies. If Bitcoin stays strong, DOGE could be gearing up for one of its biggest moves yet.

Bit Origin Puts $500 Million Behind DOGE Backing this technical breakout is a major move from Bit Origin , a Nasdaq-listed crypto firm. The company has secured funding to launch a $500 million Dogecoin treasury strategy. Growing institutional interest is always a great sign! Part of the funds will go toward accumulating DOGE, while the rest will be used to support growth within the Dogecoin ecosystem. Today’s price action also saw DOGE break through the key $0.23 resistance. If the current momentum holds, the next levels to watch are $0.28 and $0.30. DOGE ETF Buzz Adds to Momentum Another factor pushing Dogecoin forward is the rising speculation around a spot DOGE ETF. According to Polymarket , the odds of an ETF approval have jumped to 80%, with the next SEC decision expected in September 2025. The ETF hype has played a big role in earlier Bitcoin and Ethereum rallies. If DOGE gets similar approval, it could open the door to wider adoption and fresh capital. Analysts Expect More Upside Soon Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) also shared a DOGE chart on X , pointing to a breakout from a long-term falling trendline. He wrote: “Only a matter of time before #Dogecoin makes its move back up to the .28-.30 level and then well beyond.” #Dogecoin #DOGE https://t.co/Ad2qsZlEVb pic.twitter.com/h6RGRZ2hbt — Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) July 18, 2025 He also highlighted multiple retests of the trendline over the past few months, which is a pattern often seen before strong rallies. If Bitcoin stays strong, DOGE could be gearing up for one of its biggest moves yet. We’ll keep you tuned in."

ETH is now up by 20% in seven days and by 43% in the past month, with its gains today coming as Ethereum ETFs marked $5.5 billion in total inflows since debuting last summer. And it’s possible that ETH ETFs will only get busier in the coming months, with major asset manager BlackRock filing yesterday to add staking to its Ethereum ETF. This signals considerable demand for ETH, and given the coin’s enviable fundamentals, the long-term Ethereum price prediction looks incredibly bullish. Ethereum Price Prediction: Can ETH Reach $10K in July 2025, As BlackRock Files For Staked Ethereum ETF? In fact, it’s not only BlackRock that has filed to add staking to its ETF, with iShares also getting in on the act yesterday. Blackrock and iShares just filed to add staking to their ETH ETFs It''s happening. ETF holders will soon add 3% yield to their holdings — Eric Conner (@econoar) July 17, 2025 This caps an incredibly positive week for Ethereum, which has welcome several other pieces of good news. This includes SharpLink Gaming adding another $115m to its preexisting stash of ETH , which now stands at 353,000 ETH, making it the largest corporate holder of the altcoin. Not only that, but inflows into Ethereum ETFs have been skyrocketing, with the latest CoinShares report showing that ETH funds witnessed $990 million in inflows in the seven days to July 14 alone. Now is therefore a very good time to be buying Ethereum, which still remains 26% below its ATH of $4,878, meaning that it still has space to rise further. And if we look at its chart today, we see that it currently has massive momentum, although it is nearing an overbought level. For instance, its RSI (yellow) has very recently topped 80, which is very much overbought territory. Source: TradingView At the same time, ETH’s MACD indicator (orange, blue) has returned to peaks last seen in mid-May and December, with the peak in December leading to a long decline. As such, there’s an argument that ETH could be close to a correction, yet it’s also arguable that the current context points to further gains. That’s because ETH remains well below its ATH, while it had also been oversold for several months before rallying this month. We could therefore see the Ethereum price hit $4,000 at some point in August (if not sooner), while it could potentially pass $5,000 by the end of the year. How to Bet on Ethereum with Leverage on CoinFutures Given the market’s momentum and positivity, now could even be a good time to trade Ethereum more aggressively, including using leverage to go long on the ETH. There are numerous platforms and exchanges where the use of leverage is possible, but one of the best of these is CoinFutures . An offshoot of the popular CoinPoker website and app, CoinFutures enables users to place leverage bets on the direction of price movements for various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Litecoin, and Tron (among others). They can do this simply by depositing funds to its platform, and from there they can pick a crypto and bet on whether its price will rise or decline. They can make things more exciting by picking a multiplier, with up to 1000x leverage available. This carries risk, but it also multiplies potential winnings. To control risk, users can set stop losses and take profits, while there’s also an auto-cash out option to ensure that any winnings are delivered quickly.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Timmer says that if the Fed is forced to prop up the bond market, such as by buying the debt securities, the US dollar index (DXY) may tumble even lower. “If the Fed is forced back into the bond market to hold down nominal and real rates, the dollar may well lose more of its supremacy premium. Currencies are the release valve for unsustainable fiscal policy, as Japan found out a few years ago. The same is now true for the dollar, which continues to lose strength despite the Fed’s hawkish policy stance.” Source: Jurrien Timmer/X The DXY, a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of six other leading currencies from major economies, is currently at 98, down over 9% on the year. Timmer also says that if GDP growth cannot outpace the interest rate paid on government debt, the Fed intervention in the bond market will likely have to occur. “With the debt ceiling now passed, the debt is rising again and the jaws between what the Treasury is selling and what the Fed is buying continue to widen. This will only last for so long, in my view. We are now in round two of fiscal dominance, with the first $5 trillion helicopter drop taking place during COVID and now the second one about to get underway from the OBBB (One Big Beautiful Bill Act). The math is simple but difficult: as long as nominal GDP growth outpaces the funding rate (10-year Treasury yield), the debt can be considered sustainable. Hopefully, that happens, as a capex cycle (capital expenditure) from both the OBBB and the AI (artificial intelligence) boom increases productivity and therefore the non-inflationary speed limit for the US economy. If not, and if the term premium rises further, in a few years we could have an unsustainable debt spiral on our hands, requiring the Fed to re-enter the bond market to suppress the term premium once again.” Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The total crypto market cap crossed $4 trillion for the first time. As capital flows into altcoins and institutional interest grows through spot ETFs and on-chain assets, the altcoins season may finally be here. Analysts note the explosive moves in altcoins like ETH, SOL, and meme coins as clear signs of a major shift. Ethereum has already crossed $3,600, posting a 20% gain over the past week. While other altcoins like Sui, Avalanche, Cardano, Dogecoin, and XRP have rallied between 15% and 20% during the same period. Key Indicators Flash ‘Altseason’ According to Cryptorank, three key metrics show that a major shift is underway as investors rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Firstly, the Altcoin Index has jumped to 50 from just 15 a month ago. The sharp rise reflects strong altcoin performance and growing appetite for risk. Traders are actively seeking opportunities beyond Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index rises when most of the top 50 coins (excluding Bitcoin) outperform BTC over a set period. Once the index crosses 75, it signals the start of a full-blown altcoin bull market. Are we entering altseason?

Data from CoinGlass confirms that traders have been rushing to open long positions on XRP as OI has been steadily increasing since the beginning of July, moving from around $2.5 billion to their current level for a 300% increase in less than a month. Open interest for traditional futures has also jumped to 2,650 contracts worth $459 million, marking a new record for the CME Group’s recently launched XRP futures. The launch of an XRP-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week alongside the passing of the Genius Act by the House of Representatives have catalyzed this explosive move. As a result, XRP has now delivered year-to-date gains of 67%, making it the best-performing token of the top 5. XRP Price Prediction: On Track to Hit $4 After Local High Breakout XRP is now just 10.1% away from making a new all-time high. The weekend’s price action may close the deal if bullish momentum continues to gain traction. Yesterday, the price broke through its January 16 high of $3.40. This is the highest level that XRP has reached in years and the closest it has been since January 2018 to retesting its all-time high. This is a historical moment for Ripple. A set of legal victories has given its native asset a dramatic boost since October this year. Now, with a pro-crypto leadership team at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the sky is the limit. The price seems to be retesting the $3.4 resistance from above. If it stays above this mark, the odds favor a bullish XRP price prediction of $4. This level could be hit during the weekend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is as stretched as it can get as it has reached 88 in the daily chart. This is an extreme overbought level that could anticipate a strong pullback. However, positive momentum still favors a bullish XRP price prediction of $4 and possibly beyond. As the price of some altcoins like XRP seems poised to reach a new all-time high, a high-speed game called CoinPoker Crypto Futures has emerged to give users the chance to profit from the rally without the need for a wallet or understanding the complexities of real futures trading .

The weekend’s price action may close the deal if bullish momentum continues to gain traction. Yesterday, the price broke through its January 16 high of $3.40. This is the highest level that XRP has reached in years and the closest it has been since January 2018 to retesting its all-time high. This is a historical moment for Ripple. A set of legal victories has given its native asset a dramatic boost since October this year. Now, with a pro-crypto leadership team at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the sky is the limit. The price seems to be retesting the $3.4 resistance from above. If it stays above this mark, the odds favor a bullish XRP price prediction of $4. This level could be hit during the weekend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is as stretched as it can get as it has reached 88 in the daily chart. This is an extreme overbought level that could anticipate a strong pullback. However, positive momentum still favors a bullish XRP price prediction of $4 and possibly beyond.

2025-07-18 11:55:18+00:00,DigitalX’s Bold Move: Elevating Bitcoin Holdings to 425.1 BTC,"BitcoinWorld DigitalX’s Bold Move: Elevating Bitcoin Holdings to 425.1 BTC In the dynamic world of digital assets, every significant move by an institutional player sends ripples across the market. The latest news from DigitalX, an Australia-based digital asset manager , is no exception. Their recent announcement of a substantial increase in their Bitcoin holdings underscores a growing confidence among traditional investment firms in the long-term viability and value of cryptocurrencies. This isn’t just about adding more numbers to a balance sheet; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of global finance and the undeniable rise of digital currencies. DigitalX’s Strategic Expansion: Boosting Bitcoin Holdings DigitalX, a pioneering entity in the digital investment space, recently shared exciting news via X (formerly Twitter). The firm has successfully acquired an additional 57.5 BTC, pushing its total Bitcoin treasury to an impressive 425.1 BTC. At current market valuations, this portfolio is valued at approximately $78.2 million, a testament to the firm’s strategic foresight and commitment to the digital asset sector. This significant accumulation reflects a deliberate strategy to strengthen their position in the market, providing both stability and growth potential for their stakeholders. What does this mean for DigitalX and the broader market? Let’s break it down: Increased Exposure: A larger Bitcoin treasury means DigitalX has greater direct exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements, aligning their interests closely with the asset’s performance. Market Confidence: Such substantial purchases by a publicly listed company often signal confidence to other institutional and retail investors, potentially encouraging further adoption. Strategic Asset Allocation: It indicates a belief in Bitcoin as a core asset for long-term value preservation and appreciation, potentially diversifying traditional portfolios. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Holdings So Important? The accumulation of Bitcoin by institutions like DigitalX goes beyond mere financial transactions; it’s a powerful validation of the asset class. When established financial entities commit significant capital to Bitcoin, it lends credibility and stability to a market often perceived as volatile and speculative. This shift from niche interest to mainstream investment is crucial for the cryptocurrency ecosystem’s maturity. Benefits of Institutional Adoption: Legitimacy: Institutional involvement helps legitimize Bitcoin as a serious asset class, reducing skepticism among traditional investors. Market Stability: Large, long-term holdings by institutions can help reduce market volatility, as these entities are less likely to engage in speculative day trading. Infrastructure Development: Increased institutional demand often spurs the development of robust regulatory frameworks, custodial solutions, and trading platforms, making the market safer and more accessible. Capital Inflow: It brings significant capital into the market, which can support price appreciation and fund further innovation within the crypto space. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape remains a challenge, with different jurisdictions taking varied approaches to digital assets. Market Volatility: While institutions can help stabilize, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, posing risks to even large-scale investors. Security Concerns: Managing large amounts of digital assets requires sophisticated security protocols to prevent hacks and theft. This trend of increasing Bitcoin holdings by institutions is a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s journey towards mainstream acceptance. It signals a maturation of the market, moving beyond early adopters to embrace a broader financial audience. Navigating the Landscape of Institutional Crypto Investment The methods by which institutions engage with crypto are diverse, reflecting varying risk appetites and strategic objectives. From direct purchases to exchange-traded products (ETPs) and even mining operations, the avenues for institutional crypto investment are expanding rapidly. DigitalX’s direct purchase of Bitcoin is a clear sign of their conviction in the underlying asset itself, rather than just exposure through derivatives or funds. Consider the different approaches: Investment Method Description Pros Cons Direct Purchase Acquiring and holding Bitcoin directly on balance sheets. Full control, direct exposure to price. Security risks, operational complexity. ETPs (ETFs/ETNs) Investing in funds that track Bitcoin’s price, traded on traditional exchanges. Ease of access, regulated environment. Management fees, indirect ownership. Mining Operations Investing in companies that mine Bitcoin, gaining exposure through their revenue. Potential for high returns, diversified exposure.

Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all the top 10 coins per market cap are still green. Bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated by 1.6% to the price of $120,352. This is the smallest increase in this category. Also, Ethereum (ETH) rose by 6.5%, currently trading at $3,652. The price is gradually approaching the long-awaited $4,000 mark. The highest gainer is Dogecoin (DOGE) . It’s up 14.9% to $0.2434. XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) also saw double-digit increases of 12.9% and 12.3% to $3.56 and $0.868, respectively. Notably, XRP hit a new ATH of $3.65 today. In the top 100 coins category, 96 coins are green and 4 are red. Of the green ones, 14 have double-digit rises in the past days. At the top is Uniswap (UNI) with a 19% rise to $10.53. It’s followed by Hedera (HBAR) , which saw a 16.1%, now trading at $0.281. On the other side, Bonk (BONK) is down 7.4%, changing hands at $0.00003636. Pump.fun (PUMP) follows with a drop of 5% to $0.005102. The other two red coins are down below 0.2%, meaning they’re practically unchanged. Meanwhile, the crypto market surge has been fueled by positive regulatory developments. Specifically, the US House of Representatives passed three key crypto-related bills. However, Congresswoman Maxine Waters argued that the CLARITY Act, one of the above-mentioned three bills, would cause “investor harm.” “The bill presents several serious risks: it exposes consumers to exploitation by bad actors in the crypto industry, undermines national security, and ignores Donald Trump’s escalating conflicts of interest tied to his personal involvement in cryptocurrency,” Waters wrote on Thursday. ‘This Isn’t Just a Spike, It’s a Regime Change’ Sean Dawson, Head of Research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , commented on Ethereum’s surge over the past week, surpassing $3,500. “BTC is participating,” he says, “but this rally belongs to ETH.” Several factors point to a structural shift in positioning, including the technical setup, option flows, and liquidations. Thanks to macro tailwinds, falling rates, and ETF momentum, the second half of 2025 may be Ethereum’s strongest in years, he explains. “Ethereum’s moment in the sun has finally arrived,” Dawson writes in an email. “Traders are aggressively positioned for a rapid move to $4K by July 25.” Dawson argues that the sharp rally marks a potential breakout moment for ETH “fueled by bullish macro conditions, rising institutional inflows, and an overwhelming shift in sentiment.” “This isn’t just a spike, it’s a regime change. We’re seeing explosive upside bets and a wave of short liquidations. The market may finally be waking up to ETH’s asymmetric upside.” Currently, there is a 14% chance that ETH ends July above $4,000. There is also a 27% chance it surpasses $5,000 by the end of 2025. Also, there is an 18% chance that BTC moves above $125,000 by the end of July, and a 12% chance it ends the year above $170,000. Meanwhile, in the past 24 hours, 25% of Derive’s ETH trading volume has been concentrated on call options between $3,000 and $4,000 for the 25 July expiry. This is “a strong signal that traders are aligned on a fast, continued breakout,” says Dawson. Also, 8% of all open interest for that expiry is sitting on the $4,000 ETH strike. This reflects “a growing appetite for leveraged long exposure as bullish conviction builds”.

Over the last three days, the whale operating from a Bitcoin address ending in “f4au0” has been systematically disposing of its cryptocurrency reserves. Most notably, on July 15, intelligence data from Arkham, spotted by EmberCN, showed that a whale from the Satoshi era executed a transfer of 40,000 BTC, with 18,343 BTC valued at $2.172 billion being directed to Galaxy Digital, a platform that provides over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin trading services.

The recent transaction has now completed the full liquidation of the 80,000+ Bitcoin holdings, which Arkham confirms have been entirely sent to exchanges. When originally acquired fourteen years ago, these Bitcoins were valued at merely $132,000, equating to approximately $1.64 per coin. This investment has delivered the whale an extraordinary 72,000-fold return. It’s worth noting that Bitcoin began with zero value when Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2009. The cryptocurrency’s price subsequently rose from its sustained $0.10 level to $0.20 on October 26, 2010. Source: Investopedia During 2011, BTC began climbing above $1, ultimately reaching a high of $29.60 on June 8, 2011. The whale likely accumulated their Bitcoin position between February and April 2011. This transaction exemplifies the effectiveness of the popular cryptocurrency strategy “HODL,” which advocates maintaining investment positions despite market volatility. This contrasts sharply with the German Government, which many criticized for “paper handing” $3.51 billion after selling 54,000 BTC when Bitcoin traded around $58,000 in 2024. Additionally, this isn’t the first instance of dormant Bitcoin whales becoming active, particularly during bullish market phases. Last year at this time, a wallet connected to a Bitcoin miner who earned 50 BTC as a mining reward on July 14, 2010, just months following the Bitcoin network’s launch, also transferred their complete Bitcoin holdings to the Binance exchange. The miner generated over $3 million in profits from coins that were previously worth fractions of a penny. 1.75M Satoshi-era Wallets Still Hold $121B in Bitcoin A Fortune report indicates that approximately 1.75 million Bitcoin wallets have remained dormant for over ten years. These wallets collectively contain 1,798,681 BTC, representing approximately $121 billion in value. Source: Fortune Notably, the sudden reactivation of inactive wallets often generates speculation that Bitcoin whales may be preparing to liquidate substantial portions of their holdings, which can result in increased Bitcoin price volatility. For instance, during the previous occasion when the “f4au0” Bitcoin whale disposed of their holdings , approximately $236 million was deposited directly to exchanges, including Binance and Bybit, indicating that portions of the position were likely being prepared for sale. Currently, it appears the selling pressure on Bitcoin has temporarily stalled price momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,606, down 0.8% during the early trading hours of Friday. CoinGlass data reveals that traders continue to short Bitcoin, establishing a significant liquidation barrier at $121,500. However, analysts maintain that the bull run remains far from over, particularly with the emerging altcoin season, which has seen XRP establish new all-time highs above $3.7 and Ethereum break through its six-month resistance level of $3,500 .

However, analysts maintain that the bull run remains far from over, particularly with the emerging altcoin season, which has seen XRP establish new all-time highs above $3.7 and Ethereum break through its six-month resistance level of $3,500 . The total crypto market cap is rapidly approaching the $4 trillion mark, propelled by strong gains in Bitcoin, Ether, XRP. #Crypto #Trump https://t.co/xp4hohXxhE — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 Regarding Bitcoin, technical analysis suggests that surpassing the $121,000 resistance level could open the path for Bitcoin to advance toward $132,000.

One of the most significant trends in recent years has been the rise of stablecoins – digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. They act as a crucial bridge between the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and the stability of traditional finance. Now, an exciting announcement has emerged from the Qtum ecosystem, signaling a major step forward for the network and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Patrick Dai , the visionary founder of Qtum, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal ambitious plans for the launch of a native Qtum stablecoin . This move is not just another token launch; it represents a strategic enhancement designed to bolster liquidity, utility, and adoption within the Qtum network, pushing the boundaries of blockchain innovation and strengthening the overall crypto ecosystem . Unveiling the Qtum Stablecoin: What Does It Mean for the Network? The news of a native Qtum stablecoin has sent ripples of anticipation through the community. But what exactly does this mean for the Qtum network and its users? At its core, a stablecoin aims to mitigate the notorious price volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. By pegging its value to a more stable asset, it provides a reliable medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account within the blockchain environment. For Qtum, the introduction of its own stablecoin could unlock a myriad of possibilities, addressing several key needs: Enhanced Liquidity: A native stablecoin can significantly boost liquidity for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other DeFi protocols built on Qtum, making trading more efficient and less prone to slippage. Predictable Transactions: For users and businesses conducting transactions, a stablecoin offers predictability, removing the risk of value fluctuations between the start and end of a payment. New dApp Opportunities: Developers can leverage the stability of the new Qtum stablecoin to build more robust and user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps) for lending, borrowing, payments, and even complex financial instruments. Reduced Friction: Currently, users often rely on stablecoins from other chains (e.g., USDT, USDC) bridged to Qtum, which can introduce additional fees and complexities. A native stablecoin simplifies the user experience. This development is a clear signal of Qtum’s commitment to building a self-sufficient and thriving DeFi ecosystem, ensuring that its users have access to stable financial tools directly on their preferred network. Patrick Dai’s Vision: Driving Blockchain Innovation on Qtum Behind every significant blockchain development is a driving force, and for Qtum, that force is its founder, Patrick Dai . Known for his foresight and dedication to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the decentralized space, Dai’s announcement of the Qtum stablecoin is a testament to his ongoing commitment to blockchain innovation . From its inception, Qtum was designed as a hybrid blockchain, combining the robust security of Bitcoin’s UTXO model with the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum’s EVM. This unique architecture has allowed Qtum to carve out a distinct niche in the crowded crypto landscape. Dai’s vision extends beyond simply providing a platform for smart contracts; he aims to create a truly decentralized, scalable, and user-friendly blockchain that can support real-world applications. The stablecoin fits perfectly into this grander scheme. It’s a foundational layer that enables more sophisticated financial services, making the network more appealing to both developers looking to build next-generation dApps and users seeking practical blockchain solutions. This strategic move by Patrick Dai reinforces Qtum’s position as a forward-thinking project continually adapting to the evolving needs of the crypto ecosystem . Empowering Decentralized Finance: How Qtum’s Stablecoin Can Reshape DeFi The emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized traditional financial services, offering permissionless, transparent, and censorship-resistant alternatives. However, the inherent volatility of most cryptocurrencies has been a significant barrier to mainstream DeFi adoption. This is where stablecoins play a pivotal role, and Qtum’s entry into this space with its own native stablecoin holds immense potential to reshape its DeFi landscape. Consider the current state of DeFi on Qtum. While the network supports smart contracts, the absence of a deeply integrated, highly liquid native stablecoin limits the scope and efficiency of financial protocols.

While Bitcoin smashed past $123,000, XRP quietly broke its record, climbing to $3.66 for the first time in years. Here’s what’s more interesting, XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by a massive 277% in the past year, and it did so without ETF approvals or big institutional boosts. Meanwhile, Experts believe this rally could be far from over, hinting at even bigger gains ahead. XRP Outpaces Bitcoin by 277% In the last 12 months, XRP has climbed 277% against Bitcoin, while Bitcoin rose about 88%. The XRP/BTC ratio jumped from 0.00000902 to 0.0000303, showing clear relative strength. What makes this impressive is the lack of support tools XRP doesn’t have: No U.S.-approved spot XRP ETF yet. No major corporate treasury wave. No native DeFi yield is baked into the network. Still, buyers showed up. As of now, XRP is trading around $3.44 , reflecting a gain of 4.5% seen in the last 24 hours, not far from the fresh $3.66 all‑time high. One year ago, XRP was about $0.44, that’s a 9x gain. Institutional Money Flowing In Institutional interest in XRP is heating up fast. ProShares is set to launch its Ultra XRP ETF on NYSE Arca, giving investors leveraged exposure. On the top of it, big names like Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Teucrium are also lining up with active ETF filings. Apart from all, recently reported record-breaking daily volumes for XRP and Micro XRP futures, over $235 million in a single day, a sign that professional traders are piling in. Ripple Expands Global Reach Ripple isn’t slowing down, it continues building real‑world use. It recently partnered with Ctrl Alt to bring institutional-grade custody to Dubai’s real estate market, enabling tokenized property titles on the XRP Ledger. However, its Ethereum-compatible sidechain is also booming, hosting 1,300+ smart contracts since June.

2025-07-18 12:20:40+00:00,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is Bitcoin Due for a Reset Before Its Next Breakout??,"Bitcoin has seen a significant uptrend in recent weeks, climbing steadily within its ascending channel and recently hitting a new all-time high at around $123,000. However, signs of buyer exhaustion and potential distribution are starting to surface. From price action patterns to miner behavior and funding sentiment, the market seems to be entering a sensitive inflection point where a correction may be needed before the next leg up. Let’s break it down from the top. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin remains well inside its long-term ascending channel and recently printed a clean breakout above the $108K–$110K resistance zone. The price reached as high as $123K and is seemingly targeting the $140K area. This zone coincides with a potential area of profit-taking and the mid-line of the channel. The market structure remains decisively bullish, with higher highs and higher lows continuing uninterrupted. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages, located around the $100K mark, are positively sloped, offering strong dynamic support just below the price. If Bitcoin declines, this zone, along with the lower boundary of the channel, is the most probable area for a bullish reaction. Still, as long as the price holds above $108K, bulls remain in firm control, and the market might not revisit the lower boundary of the channel anytime soon. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart reveals a developing Head and Shoulders pattern, with the left shoulder already formed, the head established near $123K, and the right shoulder currently shaping up. Importantly, this pattern is not yet confirmed, as the neckline has not been broken. However, the structure suggests that if the neckline around the $117K–$116K low fails to hold, a bearish continuation toward the golden Fibonacci zone becomes highly probable. The potential rebound zone lies between $112K and $111K, which corresponds to the 0.618–0.786 retracement levels. This region aligns with the base of the rally from early July, making it a confluence of both technical and psychological support. If the neckline breaks with volume, the drop could accelerate rapidly as trapped longs exit and short-term momentum flips bearish. Until then, bulls still have time to defend the neckline and invalidate the reversal structure, but the window is narrowing. Onchain Analysis Bitcoin Retail Activity Surge Moving on to on-chain metrics, the Miners Position Index has spiked recently, indicating a notable rise in miner outflows to exchanges. Historically, this level marks increased selling activity from miners, often aligning with local tops or periods of cooling in the market. The timing of this spike, right as BTC tapped $123K, is not coincidental. Miners tend to offload during periods of price strength to maximize profits and fund their operations. This kind of on-chain behavior often precedes either a local top or a sideways grind while the market absorbs this supply. It doesn’t necessarily mean a macro reversal is coming, but it does raise short-term caution, especially when paired with overheated funding and slowing spot momentum.

Bitcoin has seen a significant uptrend in recent weeks, climbing steadily within its ascending channel and recently hitting a new all-time high at around $123,000. However, signs of buyer exhaustion and potential distribution are starting to surface. From price action patterns to miner behavior and funding sentiment, the market seems to be entering a sensitive inflection point where a correction may be needed before the next leg up. Let’s break it down from the top. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin remains well inside its long-term ascending channel and recently printed a clean breakout above the $108K–$110K resistance zone. The price reached as high as $123K and is seemingly targeting the $140K area. This zone coincides with a potential area of profit-taking and the mid-line of the channel. The market structure remains decisively bullish, with higher highs and higher lows continuing uninterrupted.

In a video posted on X, Portnoy admitted, “I would’ve made millions, and I want to cry. I don’t own it anymore, even though I was the leader of the XRP army.” Portnoy Admits He Sold Out Too Soon XRP recently broke past its yearly high of $3.29, climbing to $3.60 on Thursday and recording a 20% increase in the past 24 hours. Portnoy explained he decided to sell his XRP at $2.40 based on advice from a contact who expressed concerns that Circle, the stablecoin issuer, could compete with Ripple. This decision came just days before Ripple Labs applied for a national bank charter in the United States on July 2, shortly after Circle submitted a similar application. Speaking at Consensus 2025, Portnoy admitted his investment in XRP was driven by FOMO rather than conviction, stating he purchased the cryptocurrency simply in case it turned out to be the next Bitcoin. XRP Rally Mirrors Crypto Market Uptrend XRP’s rally was part of a broader surge across the crypto market , fueled by positive legislative developments in the United States and growing investor confidence. On Thursday alone, approximately $68.16 million worth of XRP short positions were liquidated, according to CoinGlass data , as the asset’s price spiked sharply, catching many traders off guard. The wider market upswing began on July 9, following Bitcoin’s climb past its previous May high of $112,000. However, Thursday marked a pivotal moment for the industry, with the US House of Representatives passing several key bills that could shape the future of crypto regulation in the country. Lawmakers voted 294-134 in favor of the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, aimed at establishing a clear regulatory framework for crypto markets. They also passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act with a 308-122 vote and approved the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act with a 219-210 vote.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. Amidst the bullish turn of events, as Bitcoin rose to a new ATH, the SOL price is also making positive moves. Moreover, the REX-Osprey Solana ETF saw $69.7 million worth of inflows. Talking about numbers, it is currently changing hands at $178.71 with an intraday spike of 1.74%.

However, the 6% dip in volume signals weakening momentum in the short term. If buying pressure revives, SOL may aim for $200 soon.

Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High July $158 $180 $209 Solana Price Prediction 2025 As per CoinGlass , Solana leads the crypto derivatives market with a massive $8.19 billion in open interest, far outpacing all other tokens. This indicates strong trader confidence and sustained capital inflow into SOL positions. Other notable projects like FARTCOIN, LINK, and UNI trail behind with open interest between $870M–$498M. The dominance of SOL on both the treemap and bar chart suggests it remains a favorite among leveraged traders, potentially fueling heightened volatility and price action in the near term. That’s not all, Solana is also due for the upcoming Firedancer Validator Client upgrade in Q4. If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

Why Did Chris Larsen Send $26 million worth of XRP to Coinbase Since the beginning of the year, Larsen has moved over 106 million XRP, worth approximately $344 million, to various centralized exchanges. While there is no definitive reason publicly stated by Larsen, several factors can give justification for the transfer. Amid XRP’s significant price surge, nearing its all-time high of $3.40, Ripple’s CEO moves his transaction to Coinbase, indicating a potential sale. This move also indicates that Larsen is planning a strategic adjustment to his crypto portfolio, diversifying investments or preparing for other opportunities. It also demonstrates Coinbase’s stability and key management controls to provide easy access to liquidity, allowing for quick sale for the investor.

2025-07-18 12:45:18+00:00,Federal Reserve: Waller’s Pivotal Stance and Its Crucial Economic Impact,"BitcoinWorld Federal Reserve: Waller’s Pivotal Stance and Its Crucial Economic Impact The financial world is abuzz with a significant piece of news that could reshape the landscape of global finance, including the dynamic crypto market . U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller has publicly stated his willingness to accept the role of Fed Chair if nominated by former President Donald Trump, as reported by JinSe Finance. This isn’t just a political footnote; it’s a potential shift at the helm of the world’s most influential central bank, promising profound implications for everything from interest rates to overall economic stability . Navigating the Future: Christopher Waller and the Federal Reserve’s Direction Christopher Waller, a seasoned economist and current Governor on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, brings a wealth of experience and a distinct economic philosophy to the table. Before his appointment to the Fed Board in 2020, Waller served as the Executive Vice President and Director of Research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, working closely with its then-President, James Bullard. His academic background as a professor of economics further solidifies his credentials, indicating a deep understanding of economic theory and practical application. The role of the Fed Chair is arguably one of the most powerful economic positions globally. This individual sets the tone for monetary policy , guides the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its decisions on interest rates and quantitative easing, and acts as the primary communicator of the Fed’s intentions to markets and the public. A change in leadership at this level isn’t merely symbolic; it signifies a potential recalibration of the nation’s economic strategy, impacting everything from inflation targets to employment goals. What Would Waller’s Leadership Mean for Monetary Policy? Understanding Christopher Waller’s economic philosophy is key to anticipating the potential shifts in monetary policy . Generally, Waller is perceived as having a more hawkish stance compared to some of his peers, meaning he tends to prioritize controlling inflation over maximizing employment. This perspective suggests a readiness to use higher interest rates as a primary tool to cool an overheating economy. Consider the following potential aspects of monetary policy under a Waller chairmanship: Inflation Targeting: Waller has consistently emphasized the importance of bringing inflation back down to the Fed’s 2% target. His approach might involve a less patient stance on inflation, potentially advocating for quicker or more aggressive measures if inflationary pressures persist. Interest Rate Path: While no Fed Chair acts in a vacuum, Waller’s influence could lean towards a more cautious approach to rate cuts, or even a willingness to hike rates further if economic data warrants it, prioritizing price stability over growth acceleration. Balance Sheet Management: His views on the Fed’s balance sheet, which expanded significantly during the pandemic, would likely favor continued quantitative tightening (reducing the Fed’s holdings of bonds) or at least a strong resistance to expanding it again unless absolutely necessary. This contrasts with a more dovish approach, which might tolerate higher inflation for longer to support employment and economic growth. The table below illustrates a simplified comparison: Policy Aspect Potential Waller Approach (Hawkish) Alternative Approach (Dovish) Inflation Focus Primary concern; aggressive action to curb. Balanced with employment; more patient. Interest Rates Higher for longer; quick to hike, slow to cut. Lower for longer; slow to hike, quick to cut. Balance Sheet Prefers reduction; less inclined for QE. More open to expansion (QE) if needed. Economic Growth Sacrificed if necessary to control inflation. Prioritized, even with moderate inflation. Interest Rates Under a Potential Waller Chairmanship: What to Expect? The direct and immediate impact of a new Fed Chair is often felt most acutely in the realm of interest rates . These rates, set by the Federal Reserve, are the bedrock upon which the entire financial system rests. They influence the cost of borrowing for consumers (mortgages, car loans, credit cards) and businesses (investment, expansion), and thus have a ripple effect across the economy. If Waller’s hawkish tendencies translate into policy, we could see a scenario where the Fed maintains a higher federal funds rate for a longer period than some market participants might anticipate. This could mean: Higher Borrowing Costs: Consumers and businesses might face elevated costs for loans, potentially dampening demand for housing, vehicles, and capital investments. Stronger Dollar: Higher interest rates tend to attract foreign investment, strengthening the U.S. dollar. A strong dollar makes U.S. exports more expensive but imports cheaper.

However, recent polls indicate that there is a significant possibility that the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito will fall short,"" ING noted, adding that the possibility of a sooner than expected Bank of Japan rate hike is another source for jitters in Japanese markets. But, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, investors'' aversion to the yen is likely to be short-lived. ""The macroeconomic fundamentals of the United States have not improved significantly. The data have confirmed the rebound in US inflation, and Trump''s threats to Powell, as well as the passing of the OBBBA bill , have led to a further increase in inflation expectations,"" Ardern said. OBBA stands for the recently approved one big beautiful bill in the U.S thats expected boost fiscal deficit by $3 trillion over coming years. ""As the uncertainty in Japan decreases, DXY''s performance is likely to return to decline,"" he added."

2025-07-18 12:55:23+00:00,Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: How 210K Capital Achieved a Staggering 640% Return,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury Strategy: How 210K Capital Achieved a Staggering 640% Return In a world constantly seeking new avenues for significant financial growth, one hedge fund has recently captured the attention of the global financial community with its remarkable performance. 210K Capital , led by the visionary BTC Inc. CEO David Bailey , has reported an astonishing 640% return in the past year, primarily by pioneering a unique Bitcoin treasury strategy . This groundbreaking approach has not only validated the potential of digital assets but has also redefined what’s possible in strategic corporate finance. If you’ve been wondering how some companies are navigating the volatile yet lucrative crypto landscape, prepare to be amazed by a success story that could shape the future of corporate treasuries. Unlocking Value: What is a Bitcoin Treasury Strategy ? At its core, a Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company converting a portion of its cash reserves into Bitcoin (BTC). This isn’t merely about speculating on price movements; it’s a calculated move to optimize a company’s balance sheet, hedge against inflation, and potentially unlock significant growth opportunities. While traditional corporate treasuries typically hold cash, bonds, or short-term investments, the digital age has introduced Bitcoin as a compelling alternative. Why are more companies, particularly those advised by entities like 210K Capital , adopting this strategy? Here are a few key reasons: Inflation Hedge: With central banks globally printing more fiat currency, Bitcoin’s capped supply of 21 million coins offers a strong hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power over time. Growth Asset: Bitcoin has historically outperformed traditional assets over longer periods, presenting an opportunity for significant capital appreciation. Balance Sheet Optimization: Holding Bitcoin can make a company’s balance sheet more dynamic and appealing to a new generation of investors who understand and value digital assets. Innovation and Forward-Thinking: Adopting Bitcoin signals a company’s willingness to embrace innovation and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. Pioneers like MicroStrategy famously embraced this strategy, turning their corporate treasury into a Bitcoin powerhouse. Now, David Bailey and 210K Capital are showing how this model can be replicated and even surpassed across a diverse portfolio of companies. The Genius Behind the Gains: David Bailey and 210K Capital ‘s Astounding Success The 640% return posted by 210K Capital is not just a number; it’s a testament to the strategic foresight of David Bailey and his team. Bailey, widely recognized as a key architect behind Donald Trump’s evolving pro-crypto stance, has leveraged his deep understanding of the digital asset space to guide his hedge fund to unprecedented heights. According to Bloomberg, the fund’s incredible performance stems from its investments in approximately 12 companies that strategically began acquiring Bitcoin for their treasury. What makes 210K Capital ‘s approach so effective? It’s their ability to identify promising businesses across various sectors – from hospitality to website development – and then provide them with the guidance and confidence to implement a robust Bitcoin treasury strategy . This isn’t about blind speculation; it’s about integrating Bitcoin into a company’s core financial operations in a structured, long-term manner. One of the most compelling examples of this strategy’s success is UK-based Smarter Web. This company, under the guidance of 210K Capital , adopted a Bitcoin strategy and subsequently saw an astounding 14,000% return. Such a monumental gain underscores the transformative power of integrating digital assets into traditional business models when executed with expert precision. Demystifying the Mechanics: How Were Such Massive Crypto Returns Achieved? The secret to 210K Capital ‘s success lies in a combination of astute market timing, deep research, and a commitment to educating and empowering their portfolio companies. It’s not just about buying Bitcoin; it’s about a comprehensive strategy that includes: Strategic Acquisition: Advising companies on the optimal timing and methods for acquiring Bitcoin, often through dollar-cost averaging to mitigate volatility. Risk Management: Implementing robust security protocols for storing Bitcoin and understanding the associated risks, including market fluctuations and regulatory changes. Long-Term Vision: Encouraging companies to view Bitcoin as a long-term strategic asset rather than a short-term trading instrument. This patient approach allows companies to ride out market cycles and benefit from Bitcoin’s overall upward trend.

2025-07-18 13:00:24+00:00,Historic Bitcoin Realized Cap Soars Past $1 Trillion: A Deep Dive into True Bitcoin Valuation,"BitcoinWorld Historic Bitcoin Realized Cap Soars Past $1 Trillion: A Deep Dive into True Bitcoin Valuation A monumental shift is underway in the world of digital assets. For the first time ever, Glassnode , a leading on-chain analytics firm, has reported that Bitcoin’s realized capitalization has officially surpassed the staggering $1 trillion mark. This isn’t just a number; it’s a profound indicator of the growing conviction and capital flowing into the Bitcoin network, signaling a new era of maturity for the world’s premier cryptocurrency. What does this historic milestone truly signify for investors and the broader crypto market analysis ? Understanding Bitcoin’s Realized Cap: A Trillion-Dollar Foundation To fully grasp the significance of this achievement, it’s crucial to understand what Bitcoin’s realized cap actually represents. Unlike traditional market capitalization, which simply multiplies the current price by the total circulating supply, the realized cap offers a much more nuanced and arguably more accurate picture of the capital invested in Bitcoin. It works by valuing each Bitcoin at the price it was last moved on-chain. This means: It Filters Out Lost Coins: Bitcoins that haven’t moved in years (and are potentially lost) are valued at their last transaction price, which is often much lower than current market prices, preventing them from artificially inflating the market cap. It Reflects Investor Cost Basis: Essentially, it approximates the aggregate cost basis of all Bitcoin investors. When the realized cap goes up, it means more capital is flowing into the network at higher prices, or long-term holders who acquired Bitcoin at lower prices are now selling, and new investors are buying at higher prices. It Measures True Inflow: It provides a clearer measure of the actual capital that has entered the Bitcoin ecosystem, rather than being swayed by speculative price fluctuations that don’t necessarily reflect new money. This metric is a powerful tool for crypto market analysis because it cuts through the noise of short-term volatility. It tells us about the underlying conviction of the investor base and the aggregate value at which Bitcoins were acquired. The fact that it has crossed $1 trillion indicates an enormous amount of capital has been committed to Bitcoin at various price points, culminating in this significant aggregate value. The $1 Trillion Milestone: What Does it Mean for Bitcoin Valuation? The journey to a $1 trillion realized cap is a testament to Bitcoin’s resilience and growing adoption. Glassnode highlighted that approximately a quarter of this total was added in 2025 alone, underscoring a period of rapid and substantial capital inflow. This accelerated growth in realized capitalization has several profound implications for Bitcoin valuation and its future trajectory: Increased Investor Conviction: The higher the realized cap, the more capital has been locked into Bitcoin at higher price levels. This suggests a strong belief among investors in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition, as they are willing to acquire and hold it even after significant price appreciation. Maturity as an Asset Class: Reaching such a high realized value solidifies Bitcoin’s position as a mature, trillion-dollar asset class. It moves beyond being a speculative novelty and enters the realm of established investment vehicles, attracting more institutional interest and broader mainstream acceptance. Foundation for Stability: While Bitcoin is known for its volatility, a rising realized cap can, over time, contribute to greater price stability. As more capital is invested at higher cost bases, the incentive for large-scale, panic-selling by early investors diminishes, creating a more robust foundation. Network Security and Health: A higher realized cap also indirectly reflects the health and security of the Bitcoin network. More invested capital means more participants, more miners, and a stronger, more resilient decentralized system. This milestone isn’t just about price; it’s about the collective belief and investment in the fundamental technology and economic principles that Bitcoin represents. Who is Driving This Unprecedented Bitcoin Network Growth? The surge past the $1 trillion mark in realized capitalization isn’t just a random occurrence; it’s the culmination of various forces driving Bitcoin network growth . Several key investor groups and trends have contributed significantly to this monumental achievement: Long-Term Holders (HODLers): These are the bedrock of Bitcoin’s stability. Investors who acquire Bitcoin and hold it for extended periods, often through multiple market cycles, contribute significantly to the realized cap.

At the forefront of this key advancement in the ETH spot ETFs is BlackRock, which has recently taken steps to bring this idea into reality. Integrating Staking Into Ethereum Spot ETFs As the Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) gain momentum in the crypto sector, BlackRock has taken a bold step to enhance its exchange fund. The largest asset management company has recently filed for an application to add ETH staking in its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This move was highlighted in the amended 19b-4 filing submitted by Nasdaq to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Thursday. Such a move would allow BlackRock’s fund to use Ethereum’s proof-of-stake mechanism to increase returns for investors. Thus, the exchange fund could earn rewards by confirming transactions on the ETH network. BlackRock’s action toward integrating staking in its ETHA marks a pivotal moment for the asset manager and its fund, redefining crypto investment. Should this application get a green light from the US SEC, it is likely to pave the way for a new era of cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds that combine decentralized financial mechanisms with conventional accessibility. According to TerraNewsEN on the social media platform X, “staking in Ethereum ETFs is not new.” In the X post, the informative platform noted that BlackRock and the US SEC have already discussed this move before the asset manager took a decisive step to submit an application. With positive news swelling around Ethereum, the platform is confident that BlackRock ‘s demand for staking will yield promising results, particularly in terms of price. “BlackRock did not acquire ETH for nothing,” the platform added. While ETH rose to $3,600 mark following the news, TerraNewsEN has highlighted $4,200 as the next critical level for the altcoin to reclaim. If the asset surpasses the $4,200 level, the platform anticipates a massive rally to a new all-time high of $5,000 and beyond. ETH Adoption Has Not Cooled Down Yet Another exciting news concerning Ethereum that is making headlines in the crypto landscape is GameStop’s latest attempt to acquire more ETH into its treasury . Filing Tracker reported that the leading retail gaming company could be on the verge of purchasing ETH worth over $70 million. It is worth noting that the $70 million was generated from a public offering where the firm sold about 46,666,667 shares of common stock at a price of $1.50 each.

2025-07-18 13:10:23+00:00,Bitcoin Acquisition Abruptly Halted: US Regulatory Uncertainty Causes Major Concerns,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition Abruptly Halted: US Regulatory Uncertainty Causes Major Concerns In a move that sent ripples through the cryptocurrency community, Basel Medical Group, a Singapore-based healthcare company, recently announced a significant decision: it has paused its ambitious plan to purchase 10,000 BTC. This substantial Bitcoin acquisition , initially revealed in May, has been put on hold due to ongoing and pronounced regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies in the United States. This development, first reported by Bitcoin News on X, highlights a critical challenge facing institutional players looking to embrace digital assets. Why Are U.S. Crypto Regulations Causing Such a Stir? The core of Basel Medical Group’s decision lies squarely with the current landscape of U.S. crypto regulations . Unlike many other major economies that are striving for clear frameworks, the United States has been characterized by a fragmented and often aggressive regulatory approach. This lack of clarity creates a precarious environment for large corporations considering significant crypto investments. Fragmented Oversight: Multiple agencies, including the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) and the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission), claim jurisdiction, leading to overlapping and sometimes conflicting guidance. Enforcement by Litigation: Instead of issuing clear rules, U.S. regulators have often resorted to lawsuits against crypto companies, creating a ‘regulation by enforcement’ model that fosters fear and unpredictability. Lack of Comprehensive Legislation: Despite numerous calls from the industry, comprehensive federal legislation to govern digital assets has yet to materialize, leaving a vacuum that breeds hesitation. For a company like Basel Medical Group, which operates in a highly regulated sector like healthcare, the prospect of navigating such an unpredictable regulatory environment for a massive Bitcoin acquisition is simply too risky. The potential for sudden policy shifts, new interpretations, or even legal challenges makes long-term strategic planning incredibly difficult. The Broader Impact: A Growing Crypto Investment Pause? Basel Medical Group’s decision is not an isolated incident; it’s a symptom of a larger trend. Many institutional players, while expressing interest in digital assets, are adopting a ‘wait and see’ approach. This crypto investment pause extends beyond just Bitcoin and affects the entire digital asset ecosystem. The hesitation stems from several factors: Compliance Costs: The cost and complexity of ensuring compliance in an unclear regulatory environment can be prohibitive for large entities. Reputational Risk: Companies are wary of associating with an asset class that is frequently targeted by regulators or perceived as risky by the public. Operational Uncertainty: Without clear rules, basic operations like custody, trading, and accounting for digital assets become fraught with legal ambiguities. This widespread regulatory uncertainty is arguably the biggest impediment to mainstream institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, more so than price volatility or technological complexities. Is This a Setback for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? While the news from Basel Medical Group represents a pause, it’s crucial to understand whether this is a temporary setback or a long-term deterrent for institutional Bitcoin adoption. Many analysts believe it’s the former, arguing that institutions are not abandoning crypto but rather waiting for the dust to settle. The demand for Bitcoin and other digital assets from institutional investors remains strong, driven by diversification benefits, inflation hedging properties, and the potential for significant returns. However, the path to widespread adoption requires a predictable and stable regulatory framework. What Needs to Happen for the Pause to End? For companies like Basel Medical Group to resume their plans, and for a broader influx of institutional Bitcoin investment, several key developments are needed: Clear Legislative Frameworks: Congress needs to pass comprehensive laws that define digital assets, establish clear jurisdictional lines, and set out rules for their issuance, trading, and custody. Regulatory Harmony: Greater cooperation and consistent guidance from U.S. regulatory bodies would reduce confusion and provide a unified front. International Alignment: While not essential, some level of alignment with global regulatory standards (like the EU’s MiCA regulation) could provide further confidence. The decision by Basel Medical Group serves as a stark reminder that while the crypto market continues to evolve, the path to mainstream institutional integration is heavily dependent on regulatory clarity.

2025-07-18 13:15:18+00:00,BlackRock Investment: A Landmark 5.6% Stake in KULR Technology Signals Future Growth,"BitcoinWorld BlackRock Investment: A Landmark 5.6% Stake in KULR Technology Signals Future Growth In the dynamic world of finance and technology, a significant development has captured the attention of investors and market watchers alike: global asset manager BlackRock has acquired a substantial 5.6% stake in KULR Technology. This pivotal BlackRock investment, announced by KULR Technology CEO Michael Mo on X, is not just another headline; it’s a powerful signal of institutional confidence and a potential harbinger of future trends. For those tracking the pulse of major financial players, especially as they navigate both traditional and emerging markets like cryptocurrency, this move by an industry titan like BlackRock is particularly compelling. BlackRock Investment: What Does This Strategic Stake Mean? The announcement that BlackRock, one of the world’s largest and most influential asset manager s, has taken a 5.6% strategic stake in KULR Technology, is more than just a transaction; it’s a profound vote of confidence. BlackRock’s involvement brings immense credibility and visibility to KULR, a company specializing in thermal management and battery safety solutions. This BlackRock investment underscores a growing institutional interest in innovative technologies that address critical industry needs, particularly in areas like electric vehicles, aerospace, and energy storage, where thermal runaway and battery safety are paramount. For KULR Technology, this strategic stake translates into several immediate and long-term benefits: Validation and Credibility: BlackRock’s seal of approval significantly validates KULR’s technology and business model, attracting further investor interest and potential partnerships. Enhanced Capital Position: While the specifics of the acquisition were not detailed, such a significant stake implies a substantial capital infusion or a strong endorsement that could facilitate future fundraising. Market Visibility: Being associated with BlackRock elevates KULR’s profile on a global scale, drawing attention from a broader spectrum of investors and industry players. Strategic Guidance: Although not explicitly stated, BlackRock’s presence as a major shareholder often comes with potential for strategic insights and corporate governance improvements. This move is particularly intriguing given BlackRock’s recent foray into the cryptocurrency space with its Bitcoin ETF. It highlights a broader strategy by the asset manager to diversify its portfolio across high-growth, high-impact sectors, whether it’s digital assets or cutting-edge material science. The Power of Institutional Adoption: Why It Matters for KULR Technology The concept of institutional adoption is a powerful catalyst in financial markets. When major players like BlackRock commit capital to a company, it sends a ripple effect across the investment landscape. For KULR Technology , this isn’t just about the money; it’s about the stamp of approval from an entity known for its rigorous due diligence and long-term investment horizons. Consider the typical journey of a technology company: Early Stage: Relying on venture capital and angel investors. Growth Stage: Seeking private equity and smaller institutional funds. Maturity/Expansion: Attracting large-scale institutional adoption from global asset manager s. KULR Technology, with this BlackRock investment, clearly falls into the latter category, signaling its readiness for broader market recognition and expansion. This level of institutional adoption often leads to: Increased Liquidity: Larger institutional holdings can stabilize a stock and increase trading volume. Analyst Coverage: More analysts are likely to cover the stock, leading to greater transparency and informed decision-making for retail investors. Reduced Volatility: Institutional investors typically have longer holding periods, which can reduce speculative trading and price swings. Improved Corporate Governance: With major shareholders comes increased scrutiny and often, improved operational efficiency and transparency. This strategic stake by BlackRock positions KULR Technology for sustained growth, demonstrating that its innovative solutions for battery safety are not just promising, but are now recognized as essential by the financial elite. BlackRock’s Evolving Portfolio: Beyond Traditional Asset Management BlackRock, as a leading asset manager , has historically been a titan in traditional finance, managing trillions in assets across stocks, bonds, and real estate. However, recent years have seen a noticeable shift in its investment philosophy, embracing new frontiers and technologies. The BlackRock investment in KULR Technology is a prime example of this evolving strategy. This isn’t an isolated incident.

2025-07-18 13:15:43+00:00,Judge hands former Seattle rugby player 30-month sentence over $900K crypto Ponzi,"A former semi-professional rugby player from Seattle has been sentenced to 30 months in federal prison for orchestrating a fraudulent crypto mining scheme that milked over $900,000 from investors. 37-year-old Shane Donovan Moore appeared Wednesday before US District Judge Tana Lin in Seattle to face sentencing for wire fraud. Moore had previously pleaded guilty to running a Ponzi operation through his company, Quantum Donovan LLC. Acting US Attorney Teal Luthy Miller announced the sentence in a statement released after the hearing. Fraud behind crypto reward promises According to federal prosecutors, Moore launched Quantum Donovan LLC in Washington state under the pretense of buying and operating crypto mining equipment. Investors were told that their funds would be used to purchase high-powered computers capable of generating digital currency around the clock. Court case against Quantum Donovan LLC, Shane Moore. Source: Washington State Department of Financial Institutions Moore promised them daily returns of 1% on investments and even signed services agreements guaranteeing $130 per day for each mining machine over an eight-month period. In July 2021, one such proposal claimed that a $20,000 investment would yield $200 daily, totaling $48,000 by the end of the term. Payments were to be made in Bitcoin and sent directly to investors’ digital wallets. Yet, prosecutors say those mining machines never existed. Lavish spending after falsified returns Per the FBI’s findings and testimonies in court, Moore transferred the funds meant to buy equipment into his personal bank accounts. He used the funds to support a lavish lifestyle that included shopping for electronics, clothing, luggage, and paying deposits on a luxury apartment. To prevent financial authorities from flagging the questionable amount of funds he was using, Moore used a portion of investors’ money to buy crypto and send limited returns to early investors. “The Respondents made payments in Bitcoin to investors through their cryptocurrency wallets until approximately February 2022. These payments were sporadic and were not typically made on a daily basis. Several investors had only received a fraction of the returns that they expected,” the prosecutors said in a court filing. These payments gave the investors some promise that the mining operations were functional, prompting some of them to recruit friends and family into the scheme unbeknownst to them. “Mr. Moore used the newness of cryptocurrency to commit an age-old fraud, a Ponzi scheme. “He solicited more than $900,000 from some 40 investors… instead, the money went to support a lavish lifestyle and to pay off the earliest investors to keep the fraud going,” remarked US Attorney Miller. Ponzi scheme victims included friends and athletes Moore’s victims came from several states, including Utah, Oregon, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Washington. Prosecutors said many were recruited from his rugby circles, using personal relationships and trust to lure them into investing. The scheme ultimately left many of these relationships in tatters. During his sentencing hearing, Judge Lin told Moore he had “caused emotional and psychological damage to the victims.” “Most people have suffered serious trauma like you,” Judge Lin beckoned to Moore in court. “But you have also had many opportunities and advantages that many people have not.” In total, prosecutors estimate that Moore solicited over $900,000 in investment capital from approximately 40 individuals. Still, actual financial losses amounted to over $387,000, due in part to partial returns that were sent to some investors to keep the scheme running. Despite the government’s push for a 36-month sentence, the court imposed a 30-month term of imprisonment. Moore will also be required to pay restitution to the victims.

And during a hot crypto bull run, his latest comments are getting noticed. A Zillow Search = Crypto Crash?

2025-07-18 13:24:50+00:00,"Bitcoin bulls find a new target at the $136,000 resistance zone. How long until they hit it?","Bitcoin has finally broken out of its boring $100k—$110k range and ripped through to a new all-time high of $122,000. Now, every bullish trader is pointing straight at the $136,000 level, which is the next resistance/price target. And if this momentum keeps rolling, they might just get there sooner than anyone expects. This isn’t just some random breakout either. According to Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) Heatmap, the recent chop wasn’t wasted. While everyone else screamed “range-bound,” smart money was busy accumulating around $93k–$97k and again at $104k–$110k. Those zones are now loaded with bag holders who are already deep in profit, and that kind of stacked support doesn’t vanish overnight. Bulls step into profit territory and don’t look back According to Glassnode, the crypto market is different now because the spot price is above the 95th percentile of cost basis, which sits around $107,400, based on the Quantiles model. That $107K level is usually where the profit-taking begins, mostly from short-term holders trying to lock in gains fast, as per usual. That’s already happening. After topping out at $122.6k, Bitcoin quickly pulled back to $115.9k. And guess where that rejection hit? Right after pushing above the +1 standard deviation from the Short-Term Holder (STH) cost basis. Source: Glassnode That level has often worked like a magnet and a ceiling during high-momentum phases. Every time Bitcoin pushes through it, a chunk of traders dump bags and force the market to pause. But according to Glassnode, the recent Bitcoin pullback didn’t wreck the structure; it’s merely a healthy cool-off, and if momentum holds, the next real fight will happen at the +2 standard deviation zone. Short-term holders flood the market with profit-taking Let’s talk about those short-term holders. Right now, about 95% of their supply is sitting in profit. That’s more than 1 standard deviation above the long-term average of 88%, making this the third breakout above 95% since early May 2025. That kind of repeated euphoria is a classic setup for a top. If this profit number starts to fall back under 88%, that’s where the danger really starts, because it’ll mean demand is weakening and sellers are finally starting to run out of buyers. It doesn’t need to be dramatic, says Glassnode, just a slow drip of distribution from tired hands. Source: Glassnode Next up, we’ve got the Short-Term Holder Relative Unrealized Profit, which had hit 15.4%, right at the overheated threshold, then backed off to 13.6% after the recent dip to $115,000. That kind of action says the gains are real, but not insane… yet. But this is the zone where tops often start to form, even if it takes a few more weeks of back-and-forth before things unravel. What usually follows is a wave of profit spending, and guess what? We’re seeing that too. The Percent of Spent Volume in Profit for short-term holders is now above its +1 standard deviation band, which has been a clear warning sign in the past. That metric fired off right before the 2024 peak, and we’re now seeing the first major round of heavy profit-taking since that time. It doesn’t stop there. The Realized Profit to Loss Ratio also went nuclear recently. It spiked to 39.8, miles above the +2 SD line, and while it’s cooled back to 7.3, that’s still extremely high for any bull cycle. Source: Glassnode This is what you get when the market becomes a casino. Everyone’s up big, and everyone’s ready to sell. And yet… the demand hasn’t died. Not even close. Bitcoin spot ETFs are on a heater too. Institutional investors added around 20,000 BTC just this week, and that makes it seven weeks in a row of positive inflows. So even though short-term holders are selling into strength, the big players are still buying the dip, and not in small amounts either.

2025-07-18 13:29:50+00:00,"Bitcoin’s Realized Cap Taps $1T Milestone, Fueled by 25% Surge in 2025","Bitcoin has achieved a new milestone in on-chain metrics, with its realized cap reaching $1 trillion for the first time ever. According to blockchain data provider Glassnode, 25% of that total, representing around $250 billion, flowed in during 2025 alone. New Record As Glassnode explained in a July 18 post on X, Realized Cap offers a fundamentally different perspective from the more traditional Market Cap. It values each BTC based on the price it last moved on-chain, tracking the aggregate cost basis of the entire supply. This makes it a powerful indicator of the actual capital stored within the Bitcoin network. The metric has been growing steadily since 2023, when it was under $400 billion. Its milestones have historically marked pivotal points in BTC’s trajectory, with such events often bringing with them sustained upward momentum and broader market adoption. For instance, when it crossed the $850 billion threshold in early 2025, nearly $500 billion in new capital flowed into Bitcoin. This event coincided with strong bullish signals, including a price breakout above $87,000 in April, driven primarily by institutional accumulation and whale buying, not retail speculation. This record-breaking $1 trillion mark is no different. It comes after BTC hit a new all-time high (ATH) beyond $123,000, driven by increased institutional involvement in the asset. Recently, we have seen exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and major corporations trigger massive inflows into BTC. For example, spot Bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $50 billion in fresh capital in just one year, with BlackRock’s IBIT alone pulling in more than $48 billion since launch. Corporate adoption is also accelerating, with organizations like Strategy and Metaplanet expanding their BTC holdings. As of mid-2025, over 150 public companies hold the flagship cryptocurrency as a treasury asset, collectively controlling more than 725,000 BTC. This represents a 135% increase from the previous year. Market Outlook Bitcoin’s price is currently hovering around $119,500, just 3% below its recent ATH. While the last 24 hours showed slight gains of 1.5% at the time of this writing, the asset has demonstrated impressive resilience and steady appreciation across longer timeframes, with its price an 84% improvement over the past year. The OG crypto has also gained 14% in the last month and added 9.4% over the past two weeks, even though its modest 1.26% uptick across seven days means it has fared poorly compared to the global crypto market’s 6.50% jump in the same period.

For crypto enthusiasts and tech investors alike, understanding the strategic moves of AI giants is crucial. While OpenAI has solidified its stronghold in Western markets, a formidable challenger, Perplexity AI , is charting an audacious course, focusing its strategic efforts on the burgeoning India AI market to gain a critical edge. Perplexity AI’s Strategic Shift: Why India? The global artificial intelligence arena is a high-stakes game, and San Francisco-based Perplexity AI is making a significant play. Instead of directly confronting OpenAI where it has cemented its lead, Perplexity is taking a different route: quiet, yet aggressive, expansion into India. This move positions the search-focused AI startup for mass-market scale in what is arguably the next major phase of AI adoption. India’s Unique Position: India stands as the world’s second-largest internet and smartphone market, and its most populous country. This provides an unparalleled user base that is difficult to find in other geographies. Mass Market Potential: The sheer volume of users in India offers a shortcut to rapid user acquisition, crucial for a startup aiming to challenge established players. Direct CEO Involvement: Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has personally committed to this expansion, announcing plans to hire an Indian executive and pledging a $1 million investment, along with five hours of his time each week, to support AI development within India. This calculated pivot highlights Perplexity’s understanding that user acquisition, particularly in emerging markets, could be the decisive factor in the long-term AI race. Fueling Growth: Key Tech Partnerships in India Perplexity’s strategy in India is heavily reliant on forging strong local alliances, showcasing its commitment to leveraging the existing digital infrastructure. These tech partnerships are designed to embed Perplexity’s AI search engine deeply within the Indian digital ecosystem, making its services accessible to millions. Bharti Airtel Alliance: This week, Perplexity announced a landmark partnership with Bharti Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator. The deal offers all 360 million Airtel subscribers a free 12-month Perplexity Pro subscription, normally valued at $200. This exclusive agreement means no other Indian telco can offer similar free access to Perplexity’s services. Global Telco Strategy: The Airtel deal is a cornerstone of Perplexity’s broader global expansion, which includes partnerships with over 25 telecom operators worldwide, such as recent agreements with SoftBank in Japan and SK Telecom in South Korea. Paytm Integration: Earlier this year, Perplexity partnered with Indian fintech giant Paytm. This integration allows users to access Perplexity’s AI-powered search directly through the Paytm app, which boasts over 500 million downloads and is a dominant force on India’s Unified Payment Interface (UPI) network, processing billions of transactions. Future Outreach: Internally, the startup has also discussed offering its AI search engine to Indian students, indicating a long-term vision for cultivating its user base from an early stage. These strategic alliances are critical for Perplexity to penetrate a market where direct consumer acquisition can be challenging and costly. Unpacking the India AI Market: User Growth vs. Revenue While partnerships lay the groundwork, the true measure of success lies in user adoption and, eventually, monetization.

Notably, India was Perplexity’s largest market by MAUs in the last quarter. However, ChatGPT still maintains a significant lead in absolute user numbers, indicating the scale of the challenge for Perplexity. The significant growth underscores India’s receptiveness to AI solutions, even as monetization remains a hurdle in a price-sensitive market.

2025-07-18 13:33:54+00:00,Why The Ethereum Complex Stands To Win,"Summary Ethereum''s utility is real: the securities industry is adopting it as a core platform, driving a paradigm shift via tokenization. Tokenization will unlock liquidity in private assets, with Ethereum''s blockchain and smart contracts as the backbone for this transformation. Best ways to play this trend: consider buying Ether directly or through ETFs, or invest in Ether Treasury companies like BMNR and SBET. This is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity—volatility is inevitable, but the upside for well-managed positions could be substantial. DISCLAIMER: This note is intended for US recipients only and, in particular, is not directed at, nor intended to be relied upon by any UK recipients. Nothing in this note is intended to be investment advice, nor should it be relied upon to make investment decisions. Please read our full disclaimer here . This Time With Real Utility Whether you are a crypto-skeptic, crypto-native, or, like most people, merely crypto-curious, I believe now is the time to get smart about the Ethereum complex. Don’t switch off. This is important, and not because of NFTs, Bored Apes, Lambos, or any of that nonsense. It’s important because the securities industry is embracing Ethereum as a fundamental platform, and I think that it is serious about doing so, and I think there is a good deal of money to be made by investing behind that trend. Tokenization You may have heard of ‘tokenization’ and it may sound redundant, scammy, or both. It’s not. Tokenization is a paradigm shift in the asset management industry. Today, tradable securities all reside within a set of financial institutions that have existed for decades, more than a century in some cases. Brokerages, clearing houses, custodians, all these elements of the financial plumbing are set up to deal with common stocks issued by joint-stock companies; with ETFs issued by fund managers; with options created from those stocks and ETFs; and with futures created by market-makers enabling real-world producers and traders alike to hedge their exposures. Taken together, this is one giant pool of liquidity. Liquidity, though, is the gift that keeps on giving. If you are an asset manager, a broker, a marketmaker, an investor, an asset owner, or any part of the chain - you always want more liquidity. And the next source of liquidity is to open up private pools of assets to cash that cannot, today, invest in those pools. You’ve seen the news about 401k plans being opened up to invest in private funds - this is one part of the trend. One of the primary ways this will happen is that currently non-traded assets, those that do not fit easily within the financial plumbing of public markets, have to be represented in a way that can mimic the common-stock complex. This is tokenization. A “token” is simply a digital representation of part of an asset (i.e. a part claim on the asset - like a common stock) or some other right as regards the asset. Let’s say the French state decided to monetize the Palace of Versailles. The Palace could be tokenized by creating 1m part-shares in the Palace itself, claims on ownership like a common stock; and/or by creating 10 million memberships of the Palace, entitling the holder to one free visit per year. These rights - a claim on the asset, and the opportunity to visit the asset without further cost - could be combined in a single token. Tokens of this nature offer far more flexibility to the asset owner than do common stocks. Tokens may enable the asset owner to monetize an asset without surrendering any ownership whatsoever. (Tokenization is great news for asset owners. ) Tokenization needs a database of records where the rights and obligations afforded to each token, and the ownership of each token, can be recorded. And the database of choice for this is going to be, in the main, the Ethereum blockchain. Why? Because this particular blockchain was built with “smart contracts” (also known as “contracts” for non-crypto-bros) in mind from day one. In the 1980s, if you had a big dataset to run and manage, you likely paid AT&T to run it on the Tuxedo transaction processing system, and you paid them in U.S. Dollars. In the 2020s-2030s, with a big dataset of tokens to run and manage, you are likely to be paying the Ethereum blockchain to do so, and since you can only pay the blockchain in the Ether crytpocurrency, you are going to need to get some Ether. (Another translation for non-crypto-natives - don’t be blinded by terminology - when you hear the phrase “gas fees” for Ethereum, have your brain auto-translate to “transaction processing fees” - it’s the same thing.) This is going to happen. It’s going to happen, not because some bored teenagers want it to happen. It’s going to happen because the asset management industry wants it to happen.

Some Ways To Try To Make Money From The Rise Of The Ether Complex Like any new departure in finance, the road to ric",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802220-why-the-ethereum-complex-stands-to-win?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,ETH|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|REGULATION|BTC,BMNR|SBET|BTCS|BTBT|GAME|ETH-USD|ETHE|ETHA,BTC,"Why The Ethereum Complex Stands To Win. Summary Ethereum''s utility is real: the securities industry is adopting it as a core platform, driving a paradigm shift via tokenization. Tokenization will unlock liquidity in private assets, with Ethereum''s blockchain and smart contracts as the backbone for this transformation. Best ways to play this trend: consider buying Ether directly or through ETFs, or invest in Ether Treasury companies like BMNR and SBET. This is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity—volatility is inevitable, but the upside for well-managed positions could be substantial.

This Time With Real Utility Whether you are a crypto-skeptic, crypto-native, or, like most people, merely crypto-curious, I believe now is the time to get smart about the Ethereum complex. Don’t switch off. This is important, and not because of NFTs, Bored Apes, Lambos, or any of that nonsense. It’s important because the securities industry is embracing Ethereum as a fundamental platform, and I think that it is serious about doing so, and I think there is a good deal of money to be made by investing behind that trend. Tokenization You may have heard of ‘tokenization’ and it may sound redundant, scammy, or both. It’s not. Tokenization is a paradigm shift in the asset management industry. Today, tradable securities all reside within a set of financial institutions that have existed for decades, more than a century in some cases. Brokerages, clearing houses, custodians, all these elements of the financial plumbing are set up to deal with common stocks issued by joint-stock companies; with ETFs issued by fund managers; with options created from those stocks and ETFs; and with futures created by market-makers enabling real-world producers and traders alike to hedge their exposures. Taken together, this is one giant pool of liquidity. Liquidity, though, is the gift that keeps on giving. If you are an asset manager, a broker, a marketmaker, an investor, an asset owner, or any part of the chain - you always want more liquidity. And the next source of liquidity is to open up private pools of assets to cash that cannot, today, invest in those pools. You’ve seen the news about 401k plans being opened up to invest in private funds - this is one part of the trend. One of the primary ways this will happen is that currently non-traded assets, those that do not fit easily within the financial plumbing of public markets, have to be represented in a way that can mimic the common-stock complex. This is tokenization. A “token” is simply a digital representation of part of an asset (i.e. a part claim on the asset - like a common stock) or some other right as regards the asset. Let’s say the French state decided to monetize the Palace of Versailles. The Palace could be tokenized by creating 1m part-shares in the Palace itself, claims on ownership like a common stock; and/or by creating 10 million memberships of the Palace, entitling the holder to one free visit per year. These rights - a claim on the asset, and the opportunity to visit the asset without further cost - could be combined in a single token. Tokens of this nature offer far more flexibility to the asset owner than do common stocks. Tokens may enable the asset owner to monetize an asset without surrendering any ownership whatsoever. (Tokenization is great news for asset owners. ) Tokenization needs a database of records where the rights and obligations afforded to each token, and the ownership of each token, can be recorded. And the database of choice for this is going to be, in the main, the Ethereum blockchain. Why? Because this particular blockchain was built with “smart contracts” (also known as “contracts” for non-crypto-bros) in mind from day one.

2025-07-18 13:40:18+00:00,Schwab Unveils Transformative Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot Trading Plans,"BitcoinWorld Schwab Unveils Transformative Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot Trading Plans The financial world is abuzz with news that could redefine how mainstream investors engage with cryptocurrencies. Charles Schwab, a titan in the traditional brokerage space, is poised to launch spot trading for two of the largest digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This pivotal move signals a significant acceleration in the integration of digital currencies into conventional investment portfolios, marking a new era for Schwab Bitcoin trading and beyond. What Does Rick Wurster’s Announcement Mean for Investors? Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster recently confirmed plans to introduce spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This announcement, initially hinted at in April as a key goal for the year, solidifies Schwab’s commitment to expanding its digital asset offerings. For individual and institutional investors alike, this development brings several compelling advantages: Enhanced Accessibility: Investors who are already comfortable with Schwab’s platform can now directly buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum without needing to navigate dedicated crypto exchanges. This lowers the barrier to entry significantly. Trusted Brand: Schwab’s reputation for reliability and robust customer service can provide a sense of security for those wary of the often-unregulated crypto market. Integrated Portfolios: The ability to hold traditional stocks, bonds, and digital assets within a single account simplifies portfolio management and reporting. Rick Wurster’s strategic vision highlights a recognition of the growing demand for digital assets among a broad client base, moving beyond mere curiosity to direct investment opportunities. This proactive step by a major player like Schwab is likely to encourage other traditional financial institutions to follow suit, further legitimizing the asset class. Why is Ethereum Spot Trading a Game-Changer? While Bitcoin often grabs headlines, the inclusion of Ethereum spot trading alongside BTC is equally, if not more, significant for the evolving digital asset landscape. Ethereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), represents a broader exposure to the innovation within the blockchain space. Here’s why Ethereum’s inclusion is a game-changer: Diversified Exposure: Investors gain access to a cryptocurrency with different use cases and growth drivers compared to Bitcoin, allowing for more diversified digital asset investment strategies. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum’s network supports thousands of decentralized applications. Direct access to ETH trading through a regulated platform like Schwab could funnel more capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, fostering further development and adoption. Institutional Validation: Schwab’s decision to offer Ethereum spot trading signals a growing institutional confidence not just in Bitcoin as “digital gold,” but in the broader utility and potential of programmable blockchains like Ethereum. This move underscores the maturation of the crypto market beyond its initial speculative phase. The Broader Impact on Institutional Crypto Adoption The entry of a financial giant like Charles Schwab into the spot crypto trading arena is a powerful catalyst for institutional crypto adoption . This isn’t just about one company; it’s a ripple effect that validates the asset class and paves the way for wider acceptance. Consider these implications for the broader market: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing through regulated channels typically leads to increased market liquidity, which can reduce volatility and improve price discovery. Regulatory Clarity: As major players enter, they often work with regulators to establish clearer guidelines, benefiting the entire industry. This push for clarity is crucial for long-term growth and stability. Competitive Pressure: Schwab’s move will undoubtedly put pressure on competitors like Fidelity, Vanguard, and others to accelerate their own digital asset strategies, leading to a race for market share in the crypto space. This competition ultimately benefits consumers with more options and potentially lower fees. Mainstream Normalization: When investing in Bitcoin or Ethereum becomes as straightforward as buying a stock on a familiar platform, it normalizes digital assets as a legitimate part of a balanced investment portfolio, moving them from niche speculation to mainstream consideration. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Investment As the landscape of digital asset investment rapidly evolves, investors need to be prepared for both the opportunities and the challenges that come with increased institutional involvement. While Schwab’s announcement is overwhelmingly positive, responsible investing remains paramount.

This isn’t a hypothetical scenario; it’s the groundbreaking reality unfolding with MEI Pharma. In a move that has sent ripples across both the traditional financial sector and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, the Nasdaq-listed clinical-stage pharmaceutical company has announced its ambitious plans to hold a substantial $100 million worth of Litecoin (LTC) in its treasury. This revelation, first reported by BWEnews on Telegram, marks a significant moment, potentially signaling a new wave of corporate crypto adoption among mainstream companies. MEI Pharma’s Bold Foray into Litecoin: What Does it Mean? The news that MEI Pharma, a company primarily focused on developing novel therapies for cancer, is venturing into the volatile yet promising realm of cryptocurrencies has captured widespread attention. This isn’t a small, experimental allocation; a $100 million MEI Pharma Litecoin treasury represents a considerable commitment to digital assets. For a company rooted in a highly regulated and traditional industry like pharmaceuticals, such a decision is nothing short of revolutionary. Typically, corporate treasuries are managed with a focus on liquidity, capital preservation, and a modest return, often investing in low-risk assets like government bonds or money market funds. MEI Pharma’s decision to allocate such a significant portion to Litecoin, a cryptocurrency known for its price volatility, suggests a strategic re-evaluation of traditional treasury management principles. It raises questions about their long-term financial strategy and their outlook on the future of digital assets as a store of value or even a potential growth engine. The Accelerating Trend of Corporate Crypto Adoption: Is This the New Norm? MEI Pharma’s announcement is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a growing trend: Corporate Crypto Adoption . Over the past few years, several high-profile companies have made headlines by adding cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, to their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, viewing it as a superior inflation hedge and a strategic asset in a world of depreciating fiat currencies. Tesla, under Elon Musk, also famously invested in Bitcoin, though their stance has varied. This trend highlights a shift in perception. What was once dismissed as a niche, speculative asset class is increasingly being considered by mainstream corporations as a legitimate component of a diversified treasury strategy. Companies are seeking alternatives to traditional cash holdings, which are vulnerable to inflation, especially in an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and low interest rates. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized nature and finite supply (in the case of Bitcoin and Litecoin), offer a compelling narrative as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Why are companies increasingly considering digital assets for their treasuries? Inflation Hedge: Many see cryptocurrencies, especially those with capped supplies like Bitcoin and Litecoin, as a defense against the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. Diversification: Adding non-correlated assets to a treasury can reduce overall portfolio risk and potentially enhance returns. Innovation & Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing digital assets can project a modern, innovative image, potentially attracting new talent and investors. Potential Capital Appreciation: While volatile, cryptocurrencies have shown significant growth potential over long periods, offering a chance for substantial returns. Why a $100 Million LTC Treasury? Unpacking MEI Pharma’s Strategic Choice Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of MEI Pharma’s announcement is their specific choice of Litecoin for their LTC Treasury . While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) typically dominate the headlines for institutional adoption, Litecoin’s selection prompts a deeper dive into its unique characteristics and potential strategic advantages. Often referred to as ‘silver to Bitcoin’s gold,’ Litecoin was created with the aim of faster transaction times and a larger total supply. Here are a few reasons why MEI Pharma might have opted for Litecoin: Faster Transactions and Lower Fees: Litecoin boasts significantly faster block generation times (2.5 minutes) compared to Bitcoin (10 minutes), leading to quicker transaction confirmations and generally lower fees. For a company that might foresee potential transactional uses or simply values efficiency, this could be a factor.

2025-07-18 14:05:18+00:00,US Stock Market Surges: A Crucial Boost for Investor Confidence,"BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Surges: A Crucial Boost for Investor Confidence The financial world is buzzing with optimism as the US stock market kicks off the day with a robust performance. For anyone tracking the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape, understanding the pulse of traditional financial markets is paramount. Today’s positive open on Wall Street sends a clear signal of strengthening market sentiment , a factor that often ripples through various asset classes, including digital currencies. Why Are US Stock Markets Opening Higher Today? Today’s upward trajectory in the US stock market indices reflects a renewed sense of optimism among investors. As trading commenced, the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posted gains, indicating broad-based positive momentum. Here’s a quick look at the opening figures: S&P 500: +0.26% NASDAQ: +0.23% Dow Jones: +0.19% Several factors contribute to such an encouraging start. Often, positive corporate earnings reports, favorable economic data releases, or even shifts in monetary policy expectations can fuel investor enthusiasm. A strong start like this typically suggests that investors are shrugging off immediate concerns and focusing on potential growth opportunities. This positive outlook cultivates a healthier environment for various investments. How Does This Positive Market Sentiment Influence Crypto? The correlation between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning crypto space has become increasingly evident, particularly over the past few years. When market sentiment in the stock market is positive, it often translates into increased risk appetite across the board. Cryptocurrencies, often viewed as risk-on assets, tend to benefit from this shift. Historically, the NASDAQ, with its heavy weighting towards technology stocks, has shown a notable correlation with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. This is because many crypto investors are also tech-savvy individuals or institutions who participate in both markets. A buoyant NASDAQ can suggest a willingness among these investors to allocate capital towards growth-oriented assets, including digital assets. This ripple effect is a crucial aspect of understanding the broader crypto market impact . What Key Economic Indicators Should Crypto Investors Watch? While the immediate gains in the US stock market are encouraging, savvy crypto investors understand that these movements are often driven by underlying economic indicators . Keeping an eye on these broader economic signals can provide foresight into future market trends: Inflation Data (CPI, PCE): High inflation can prompt central banks to raise interest rates, potentially making riskier assets like crypto less attractive. Conversely, cooling inflation might signal a more accommodative monetary policy. Interest Rate Decisions (Federal Reserve): The Fed’s stance on interest rates directly influences borrowing costs and investor liquidity. Lower rates generally favor growth assets. Employment Reports (Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate): Strong employment figures often indicate a healthy economy, which can bolster consumer spending and corporate profits, indirectly supporting risk assets. GDP Growth: A robust Gross Domestic Product suggests economic expansion, which typically correlates with stronger equity markets and, by extension, a more confident environment for crypto investments. Monitoring these indicators helps investors gauge the overall economic health and anticipate potential shifts in investor confidence that could affect both stocks and crypto. Are There Any Challenges Amidst This Optimism? While today’s market open paints a rosy picture, it’s essential for investors to maintain a balanced perspective. Even during periods of high investor confidence , challenges can emerge. These might include: Persistent Inflation Concerns: Despite recent improvements, inflation could prove stickier than anticipated, leading to renewed hawkishness from central banks. Geopolitical Tensions: Unforeseen global events can quickly dampen market sentiment and trigger risk-off behavior, impacting both traditional and crypto markets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly in the US, remains a significant factor that can introduce volatility and uncertainty.

BitcoinWorld US Stock Market Surges: A Crucial Boost for Investor Confidence The financial world is buzzing with optimism as the US stock market kicks off the day with a robust performance. For anyone tracking the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape, understanding the pulse of traditional financial markets is paramount. Today’s positive open on Wall Street sends a clear signal of strengthening market sentiment , a factor that often ripples through various asset classes, including digital currencies. Why Are US Stock Markets Opening Higher Today? Today’s upward trajectory in the US stock market indices reflects a renewed sense of optimism among investors. As trading commenced, the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posted gains, indicating broad-based positive momentum. Here’s a quick look at the opening figures: S&P 500: +0.26% NASDAQ: +0.23% Dow Jones: +0.19% Several factors contribute to such an encouraging start. Often, positive corporate earnings reports, favorable economic data releases, or even shifts in monetary policy expectations can fuel investor enthusiasm. A strong start like this typically suggests that investors are shrugging off immediate concerns and focusing on potential growth opportunities. This positive outlook cultivates a healthier environment for various investments. How Does This Positive Market Sentiment Influence Crypto? The correlation between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning crypto space has become increasingly evident, particularly over the past few years. When market sentiment in the stock market is positive, it often translates into increased risk appetite across the board. Cryptocurrencies, often viewed as risk-on assets, tend to benefit from this shift. Historically, the NASDAQ, with its heavy weighting towards technology stocks, has shown a notable correlation with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. This is because many crypto investors are also tech-savvy individuals or institutions who participate in both markets. A buoyant NASDAQ can suggest a willingness among these investors to allocate capital towards growth-oriented assets, including digital assets.

For investors tracking the digital economy, the recent performance of Coinbase stock has been nothing short of electrifying. On July 18, Coinbase (COIN) made headlines by hitting an unprecedented $435.7, marking a significant milestone for the leading crypto exchange and the broader cryptocurrency market. This surge wasn’t just a fleeting moment; it represented a remarkable 71% increase over the past month and a solid 5.97% jump from the previous trading day, according to TradingView data. But what exactly fueled this impressive climb, and what does it signify for the future of digital assets and the companies building their infrastructure? The Unprecedented Ascent of Coinbase Stock: A Deep Dive into COIN’s Record High The journey of Coinbase (COIN) to its all-time high of $435.7 on July 18 is a story of market confidence and a growing appetite for exposure to the digital economy. This isn’t just a number; it reflects strong investor belief in Coinbase’s business model and its position at the forefront of the burgeoning crypto space. When a stock reaches such a peak, it often signals a combination of robust company performance, positive market sentiment, and increasing adoption of the underlying industry. For COIN, this particular high point came after a period of significant growth. The 71% climb in just one month highlights intense buying pressure and a rapid re-evaluation of the company’s value by the market. This kind of momentum often attracts further attention, drawing in new investors eager to participate in the rally. It also solidifies Coinbase’s status as a bellwether for the crypto industry within traditional financial markets. Understanding the significance of this all-time high requires looking beyond just the daily fluctuations. It speaks to the long-term potential investors see in Coinbase as a regulated, publicly traded gateway to the world of cryptocurrencies. This sustained interest in Coinbase stock suggests that many view it not just as a speculative play, but as a fundamental infrastructure provider for the financial system of tomorrow. Unpacking the Factors Driving the COIN Price Surge: What’s Fueling the Rally? The remarkable surge in COIN price isn’t attributable to a single factor but rather a confluence of powerful forces shaping both the crypto industry and traditional financial markets. Let’s explore some of the key drivers: Broader Cryptocurrency Market Bull Run: Perhaps the most direct influence, the overall upward trend in the cryptocurrency market has provided a significant tailwind for Coinbase. When Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major digital assets experience rallies, trading volumes on platforms like Coinbase naturally increase, directly boosting the company’s revenue from transaction fees. A buoyant crypto market translates to more activity, which directly benefits a leading crypto exchange. Increasing Institutional Adoption: More and more institutional investors, from hedge funds to corporate treasuries, are allocating capital to digital assets . Coinbase, with its robust security, regulatory compliance efforts, and institutional-grade services (like Coinbase Prime), is a preferred partner for these large players. This influx of institutional money not only legitimizes the crypto space but also drives significant volume through Coinbase’s platforms. Strong Company Fundamentals and Product Expansion: Beyond market sentiment, Coinbase’s own performance plays a crucial role. The company has consistently demonstrated strong user growth, expanding product offerings (such as staking services, Coinbase Wallet, and NFT marketplace initiatives), and strategic acquisitions. These developments enhance its ecosystem and diversify its revenue streams beyond just trading fees. Anticipation of Regulatory Clarity: While the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains evolving, any signs of potential clarity or favorable frameworks can significantly boost investor confidence in regulated entities like Coinbase. The prospect of clearer rules can attract more traditional investors who have been hesitant due to uncertainty. Retail Investor Enthusiasm: A new wave of retail investors, often driven by social media trends and a desire to participate in disruptive technologies, has also contributed to increased trading activity. Coinbase’s user-friendly interface and brand recognition make it a go-to platform for many entering the crypto space for the first time. These interconnected factors create a powerful positive feedback loop, pushing the COIN price higher and reinforcing its position as a key player in the digital economy.

2025-07-18 14:11:29+00:00,Commerce Secretary''s son Brandon Lutnick plans to be ''sitting at the heart of crypto'',"Brandon Lutnick is trying to build his own lane in crypto, not ride on his father’s legacy. The 27-year-old son of billionaire U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick flew into Las Vegas in late May with Cantor Fitzgerald bankers to push deeper into crypto during the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Brandon showed up with a new company called Twenty One Capital , backed by Tether Holdings, SoftBank, and the family firm. The goal was direct—buy Bitcoin in bulk and figure out how to build Cantor’s future around it. According to Bloomberg, investors didn’t waste time. Dozens pitched Cantor teams at the Venetian hotel, offering ideas for new treasury companies or asking for help funding them. These weren’t vague interest checks. They wanted Cantor to lead deals that looked like Strategy’s treasury model—public companies that raise money just to buy more Bitcoin. Cantor combines SPAC with BSTR for Bitcoin-focused firm By Thursday, Cantor gave them an answer. The firm merged one of its SPACs with a new Bitcoin treasury company called BSTR , which will now be led by Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and an early figure in Bitcoin’s history. The deal was designed to make BSTR one of the biggest treasury-style crypto firms in the market. “I want to be sitting at the heart of crypto,” Brandon said in an interview the same day the BSTR deal was announced. “As a young leader, crypto is really where I can try to drive growth in the firm.” The model isn’t new, but it’s working. Strategy, the renamed MicroStrategy, has jumped 56% this year. Bitcoin is only up 27%. Investors are paying a premium for shares in companies that hold large crypto positions, and Brandon’s betting Cantor can do the same… but bigger. Twenty One Capital is already considering applying for money-transmitter licenses, a move that would allow the firm to process funds and exchange currencies legally across the U.S. People involved say the company could expand into trading, lending, asset management, and advisory services, all of it tied to crypto. Jack Mallers, the CEO of Twenty One, said, “We really do feel there’s nothing we can’t do,” when asked if the firm planned to build out financial services. Washington moves help Cantor’s crypto expansion The timing lines up. Washington is starting to support crypto publicly. Lawmakers are pushing new stablecoin legislation , and regulators are cutting back pressure. Major U.S. banks are talking about building stablecoins. That’s giving institutional investors more reasons to fund crypto projects. “With legislation now coming out for stablecoins, they’ll all get more comfortable over time,” Brandon said, pointing to the shift in investor attitude as lawmakers begin to outline rules. Cantor, meanwhile, has been busy beyond BSTR. The firm has launched more SPACs than any other bank this year. It also launched a Bitcoin-backed lending product, made senior hires in its investment bank, and bought hedge fund O’Connor from UBS. Inside Cantor, the crypto push is backed by Brandon’s older brother Kyle Lutnick, the firm’s executive vice chairman, along with investment bank co-CEOs Sage Kelly, Pascal Bandelier, and Christian Wall. Richard Wu, a former healthcare banker at Cantor, has also moved into the crypto unit. He’s now focused fully on the firm’s digital asset operations, including work related to Ethereum and TON, not just Bitcoin. Brandon knows he’s not replacing his father, but he doesn’t have to. “I’m not my Dad, and there was a hole to fill,” he said. “I’m proud of how this firm has been able to step up.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

For the crypto community, announcements made via non-traditional channels like Truth Social often carry an additional layer of intrigue and can sometimes bypass mainstream media filters, leading to more direct, unfiltered reactions within online communities.

Crypto markets, known for their volatility, are particularly susceptible to news cycles, especially those that hint at shifts in economic or regulatory environments.

2025-07-18 14:21:46+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Struggles To Stay Above $120,000","Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crossed $120,000 during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $120,800. However, it failed to sustain momentum and fell back, dropping to its current level of $118,970. The flagship cryptocurrency is marginally up over the past 24 hours. The US House of Representatives cleared three crucial bills aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for crypto, which has buoyed the market, as BTC and other cryptocurrencies trade in positive territory. Not All Bitcoin Treasury Companies See Surging Stock Prices The rapid growth of Bitcoin treasury companies shows that the asset has become a key part of the traditional financial system. However, while many firms hold BTC as a reserve asset, markets are taking into account how they hold it. According to a Nansen report, new regulatory standards and macroeconomic factors have changed how corporations view exposure to BTC . This change has led to the largest firms holding over 700,000 BTC . Companies like Strategy, Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, Twenty One Capital, and Metaplanet collectively hold over $81 billion worth of BTC . Strategy holds the most substantial chunk of these Bitcoin holdings with 601,550 BTC . However, not all of these companies register the same effect on their stock prices. While Strategy trades at nearly double the value of its Bitcoin holdings, Marathon Digital, with Bitcoin accounting for 85% of its market cap, trades at par with its Bitcoin reserves. According to Nansen, this shows that markets care about how a Bitcoin treasury company structures its holdings. Strategy uses debt, which allows the company to consistently accumulate Bitcoin and act as a leveraged bet on its price. This gives the company’s stock greater upside, but also leaves it vulnerable to more volatility. As a result, Strategy’s stock has outperformed Bitcoin in the long term. Nansen stated in its report, “Investors treat MicroStrategy akin to a leveraged Bitcoin ETF, amplifying exposure to Bitcoin price movements. Consequently, its stock typically exhibits 2–3× Bitcoin’s volatility.” Regulatory Environment Pushing Bitcoin Higher Bitcoin (BTC) is riding on optimism that a clear US regulatory framework will encourage wider adoption. Investor optimism has surged after the US House of Representatives passed the GENIUS Act, which will create a new regulatory framework for stablecoins. It also passed two other bills, the CLARITY Act, which aims to create a clear market structure for cryptocurrencies, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Additionally, some reports have claimed that President Trump intends to sign an executive order to open up the retirement market to alternative investment avenues, including cryptocurrencies. Economist Mohit Kumar stated, “The regulatory environment remains supportive, and we see further upside in crypto assets.” However, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said nothing should be considered official unless it comes from President Trump himself. “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future. No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself.” Satoshi-Era Whale Moves Final 40,191 BTC To Trading Desks A long-dormant Satoshi-era whale has moved their entire Bitcoin stash of 80,000 BTC to trading desks, with the final tranche of 40,191 BTC moved to Galaxy Digital on Friday, likely indicating a potential sale. While sending crypto to exchanges or trading desks does not confirm a sale, large amounts such as this are typically held in cold wallets, which gives market watchers reason to believe a sale is imminent. Data from Arkham Intelligence shows that the coins were transferred to a Galaxy-labeled address across 15 transactions. The Bitcoin whale, who acquired their stash over 14 years ago, began moving their Bitcoin on July 4, sending the tokens to a new wallet address. The whale moved 40,010 BTC to Galaxy Digital on Tuesday. The coins are being rerouted to Coinbase, Gemini, Bitstamp, and other addresses, suggesting potential offloading. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to reclaim $120,000 as sellers prevent a move higher. The flagship cryptocurrency has traded below this level since Tuesday, when it plunged to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising to $118,641, and reached an intraday high of $120,812 on Thursday before settling at $119,101. The current session saw another push above $120,000 before the price declined to current levels. BTC’s rally is taking a breather after Monday’s unprecedented push above $123,000. The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $123,091 on Monday, but has failed to reclaim $120,000 since Tuesday’s decline.

2025-07-18 14:30:29+00:00,Bitcoin Whale Activity: Unveiling Critical Profit Taking Trends,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Activity: Unveiling Critical Profit Taking Trends In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, few movements capture attention quite like those of Bitcoin whales. These colossal holders of BTC, often with thousands of coins, have the power to sway market sentiment and price action with their significant transactions. Recently, a notable surge in Bitcoin whale activity has been observed, with substantial deposits flowing into crypto exchanges. This trend, according to Glassnode data, is nearing yearly highs, sparking intense discussion and speculation across the crypto community. What does this heightened activity truly signify? Is it a precursor to a major price correction, or simply a strategic maneuver by seasoned investors? Understanding Bitcoin Whale Activity: What’s Behind the Surge? When we talk about Bitcoin whale activity , we’re referring to large entities – individuals or institutions – moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin. These movements are closely tracked because of their potential impact. Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics firm, recently highlighted a significant uptick in BTC transfers to exchanges. Their data reveals that the 7-day moving average for these transfers is approaching 12,000 BTC. To put this in perspective, this level is one of the highest seen this year, mirroring a similar spike observed in early November 2024. While still below the absolute peak of last year, the current trajectory is undeniable and warrants close examination. Definition: A Bitcoin whale typically holds a large amount of BTC, enough to influence market dynamics with a single transaction. Current Trend: The 7-day moving average of BTC deposits to exchanges is nearing 12,000 BTC, indicating significant movement. Historical Context: This level is comparable to a spike seen in early November 2024, though it remains below last year’s highest peak. Significance: Such large movements often precede notable price action or shifts in market sentiment, making them crucial for market watchers. Why Are BTC Exchange Deposits Surging? Unpacking the Motives The primary question on everyone’s mind is: what motivates these massive BTC exchange deposits ? Historically, increased transfers to exchanges often signal an intent to sell. When Bitcoin moves from a cold wallet (offline storage) to an exchange, it makes it easier and quicker for the owner to execute a trade, whether that’s selling for fiat, swapping for stablecoins, or trading into altcoins. There are two main interpretations currently dominating the discussion: 1. Crypto Profit Taking This is the most common and immediate assumption. After periods of significant price appreciation, whales might decide it’s time to realize gains. If Bitcoin has seen a substantial rally, moving coins to an exchange allows them to ‘take profits’ by selling at elevated prices. This strategic move helps them secure their returns and manage their portfolio risk. The recent upward trajectory of Bitcoin’s price could certainly be a catalyst for such decisions, especially as psychological resistance levels are approached or breached. This is a classic example of crypto profit taking , where investors capitalize on market highs. 2. Capital Rotation Alternatively, these deposits might not be solely for selling into fiat.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Whale Activity: Unveiling Critical Profit Taking Trends In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, few movements capture attention quite like those of Bitcoin whales. These colossal holders of BTC, often with thousands of coins, have the power to sway market sentiment and price action with their significant transactions. Recently, a notable surge in Bitcoin whale activity has been observed, with substantial deposits flowing into crypto exchanges. This trend, according to Glassnode data, is nearing yearly highs, sparking intense discussion and speculation across the crypto community. What does this heightened activity truly signify? Is it a precursor to a major price correction, or simply a strategic maneuver by seasoned investors? Understanding Bitcoin Whale Activity: What’s Behind the Surge? When we talk about Bitcoin whale activity , we’re referring to large entities – individuals or institutions – moving substantial amounts of Bitcoin. These movements are closely tracked because of their potential impact. Glassnode, a leading on-chain analytics firm, recently highlighted a significant uptick in BTC transfers to exchanges. Their data reveals that the 7-day moving average for these transfers is approaching 12,000 BTC. To put this in perspective, this level is one of the highest seen this year, mirroring a similar spike observed in early November 2024. While still below the absolute peak of last year, the current trajectory is undeniable and warrants close examination. Definition: A Bitcoin whale typically holds a large amount of BTC, enough to influence market dynamics with a single transaction. Current Trend: The 7-day moving average of BTC deposits to exchanges is nearing 12,000 BTC, indicating significant movement. Historical Context: This level is comparable to a spike seen in early November 2024, though it remains below last year’s highest peak. Significance: Such large movements often precede notable price action or shifts in market sentiment, making them crucial for market watchers. Why Are BTC Exchange Deposits Surging? Unpacking the Motives The primary question on everyone’s mind is: what motivates these massive BTC exchange deposits ? Historically, increased transfers to exchanges often signal an intent to sell. When Bitcoin moves from a cold wallet (offline storage) to an exchange, it makes it easier and quicker for the owner to execute a trade, whether that’s selling for fiat, swapping for stablecoins, or trading into altcoins. There are two main interpretations currently dominating the discussion: 1. Crypto Profit Taking This is the most common and immediate assumption. After periods of significant price appreciation, whales might decide it’s time to realize gains. If Bitcoin has seen a substantial rally, moving coins to an exchange allows them to ‘take profits’ by selling at elevated prices. This strategic move helps them secure their returns and manage their portfolio risk. The recent upward trajectory of Bitcoin’s price could certainly be a catalyst for such decisions, especially as psychological resistance levels are approached or breached. This is a classic example of crypto profit taking , where investors capitalize on market highs. 2. Capital Rotation Alternatively, these deposits might not be solely for selling into fiat. Whales could be rotating their capital within the crypto ecosystem. This means they might be preparing to: Swap BTC for Altcoins: Anticipating an ‘altcoin season’ where smaller cryptocurrencies outperform Bitcoin, thus moving their Bitcoin to exchanges to trade for other assets. Move into Stablecoins: Parking funds in stablecoins like USDT or USDC to hedge against potential volatility or wait for better entry points, without necessarily exiting the crypto market entirely.

2025-07-18 14:30:31+00:00,Bitcoin Refugee Adoption Could Hit 7.5 Million By 2035: New Study,"The Digital Assets Research Institute (DARI) has published the first quantitative study of Bitcoin’s role in humanitarian crises, concluding that the cryptocurrency has already helped an estimated 329,000 refugees safeguard, transport or rebuild their savings after fleeing conflict or persecution. The analysts warn that the figure is a floor, not a ceiling: if present adoption and displacement trends persist, between 6.5 million and 7.5 million refugees could be relying on Bitcoin by 2035, a ten-fold increase that would move the asset “from anecdote to infrastructure” in global relief dynamics. Because on-the-ground surveys are often impossible in war zones or camps, DARI combined UNHCR country-level refugee data with TripleA’s 2024 crypto-ownership rates, then isolated Bitcoin users by applying a 65 percent share derived from Binance Research. To stay conservative, the team subtracted the roughly 22 percent of displaced people who remain in long-term camps without reliable internet or smartphones. The remaining cohort—those who actually cross borders and reach connectivity—produced the 329,000 baseline. The model also assumes digital-asset ownership among refugees mirrors that of their home population, an assumption the authors describe as “erring on the side of understatement” because educated, mobile citizens are disproportionately represented among people able to flee. Why Bitcoin, Not Stablecoins DARI finds that refugees gravitate toward Bitcoin for the same properties that once made physical gold attractive: portability, censorship-resistance and independence from failing banks. By contrast, stablecoins such as USDC can be frozen by issuers and require intermediaries that often collapse in wartime. “There are no verified cases of refugees independently using stablecoins like USDC or Tether to escape conflict zones,” the report notes, adding that Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer architecture “gives it an edge as a grassroots tool for those fleeing authoritarian regimes and collapsing economies”. The aggregate numbers are grounded in vivid case studies. During Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, a 20-year-old IT worker known as Fadey escaped to Poland with $2,000 in Bitcoin on a USB stick after ATMs capped withdrawals at the hryvnia equivalent of thirty-three dollars. “I couldn’t withdraw cash at all… the queues were so long, and I couldn’t wait that much time,” he told reporters; the cryptocurrency paid for food, lodging and onward travel, sparing his family a refugee-camp limbo. In Gaza’s 2023 siege, taxi-driver Yusef Mahmoud crowdfunded more than 1.5 billion satoshis—about one Bitcoin at the time—to buy water, food and generator fuel for hundreds trapped behind the blockade. “We only have cash or Bitcoin,” he said after banks and payment apps collapsed. Grass-roots experiments extend beyond war. After the 2021 Nyiragongo eruption displaced thousands in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local volunteers distributed QR-coded Bitcoin to families and persuaded merchants to accept it for soap, medicine and building materials, seeding a micro-economy where traditional aid channels had stalled. Economic Shock-Absorber For Host Nations DARI argues that refugees who arrive with even modest Bitcoin holdings integrate faster and require less public assistance. Field interviews suggest that crypto-enabled newcomers can rent accommodation, arrange transport and search for work without waiting for bureaucratic cash-aid programmes, relieving pressure on already-strained host budgets. “Refugees who carry Bitcoin can re-establish their lives more quickly,” the authors write, urging regulators to treat self-custodied wallets as personal property and to carve out humanitarian exemptions in anti-money-laundering rules. With global displacement topping 117 million people and Bitcoin adoption still compounding at roughly twenty percent per year, the report calls on governments and NGOs to prepare for a world in which “a memorised twelve-word seed phrase may be the last vestige of a person’s economic identity”. Rather than viewing the cryptocurrency solely through the lens of illicit-finance risk, policymakers should recognise its emerging humanitarian function and support responsible, rights-preserving use, DARI says.

This surge has positioned ETH as one of the strongest performers in the current crypto market cycle, igniting optimism among investors and analysts alike. With bulls in control, many are pointing to growing momentum across altcoins as a sign that the long-anticipated altseason may finally be underway.

This achievement reflects not only price appreciation but also a rising wave of global recognition and adoption. Institutional demand is climbing, spot ETF inflows are surging, and technical indicators remain firmly in bullish territory. As Bitcoin consolidates after reaching new all-time highs, Ethereum’s relative strength is drawing attention. The coming days will be key in confirming whether ETH can sustain this momentum and push toward new highs, or if it will face resistance at this psychological level. For now, market sentiment remains optimistic, and Ethereum’s positioning among the world’s top assets hints at a maturing digital economy with ETH at its center. Global Adoption Increases For Ethereum Ethereum has officially become the 26th most valuable asset globally by market capitalization, according to data shared by top analyst Ted Pillows. With a market cap of over $416 billion, Ethereum now sits among the world’s financial giants—an impressive milestone that underscores the asset’s growing legitimacy and investor interest. Pillows added that this positioning could mark the beginning of Ethereum FOMO, as both retail and institutional investors react to rising momentum and market structure. This surge in valuation comes on the heels of a major legislative breakthrough. The US House of Representatives passed three critical crypto bills yesterday, including the GENIUS Act and the Clarity Act. These laws aim to bring much-needed regulatory transparency to the crypto sector, further reinforcing investor confidence. The passage of these bills is viewed as a turning point in US crypto policy, setting the stage for broader institutional adoption and innovation. Meanwhile, institutions are ramping up ETH accumulation. On-chain data reveals steady inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs, while a noticeable premium on Coinbase suggests strong demand from US-based whales. Combined with a bullish price structure and improving macro conditions, Ethereum appears to be entering an expansive phase, not only in price but also in network usage and adoption.
