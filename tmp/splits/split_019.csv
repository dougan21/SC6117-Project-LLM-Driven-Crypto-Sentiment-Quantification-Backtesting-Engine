2025-07-28 12:55:10+00:00,Mara Bitcoin Mining: Unlocking a Massive $950M for Future Growth,"BitcoinWorld Mara Bitcoin Mining: Unlocking a Massive $950M for Future Growth The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with significant financial moves, and U.S.-based crypto mining giant MARA Holdings has just made headlines with a strategic funding initiative that could reshape its future. In a move signaling robust confidence in its growth trajectory and the long-term potential of digital assets, Mara Bitcoin Mining has successfully completed a substantial $950 million offering of 0% convertible senior notes due 2032. This monumental raise, as reported via a GlobeNewswire press release, is poised to fuel the company’s ambitious plans, primarily focusing on expanding its Bitcoin reserves, settling existing debts, and bolstering general corporate operations. But what exactly do these “convertible notes” mean, and how will this capital infusion impact the broader crypto landscape? What are Convertible Notes and Why are they Strategic for Mara Bitcoin Mining ? To fully grasp the significance of MARA Holdings’ latest financial maneuver, it’s essential to understand the instrument at its core: convertible senior notes. These aren’t your everyday loans. Think of them as a hybrid financial product, blending elements of both debt and equity. Here’s a quick breakdown: Debt Component: Initially, these notes function like bonds. Investors lend money to the company (MARA Holdings) and typically receive interest payments. In this specific case, the notes are 0% interest, making them particularly attractive for MARA as they avoid immediate cash outflows for interest. Equity Component: The “convertible” aspect is key. At a pre-determined future date, or under specific conditions, these notes can be converted into shares of the company’s common stock. This gives investors the potential to participate in the company’s growth if its stock price rises. So, why is this a strategic choice for Mara Bitcoin Mining ? Several reasons stand out: Cost-Effective Capital: With a 0% interest rate, MARA avoids the ongoing interest payments associated with traditional debt, preserving cash flow for operations and investments. Deferred Dilution: Unlike issuing new shares directly, convertible notes allow a company to raise capital without immediately diluting the ownership stake of existing shareholders. Dilution only occurs if and when the notes are converted into equity, typically at a higher stock price. Flexibility and Market Confidence: Issuing such a large volume of notes indicates strong investor confidence in MARA’s future and the Bitcoin market. It also provides MARA with significant financial flexibility to execute its growth strategy. How Will Mara Bitcoin Mining Deploy This Massive Capital? The $950 million raised isn’t just sitting idle; it’s earmarked for specific, high-impact purposes that align with Mara Bitcoin Mining ‘s core business and long-term vision. According to the press release, the funds will be allocated as follows: Additional Bitcoin Purchases: A significant portion of the funds will be dedicated to acquiring more Bitcoin. For a crypto mining company, Bitcoin isn’t just a product; it’s a strategic asset. Accumulating more Bitcoin allows MARA to benefit directly from any appreciation in Bitcoin’s value, strengthening its balance sheet and providing a hedge against market fluctuations. This move underscores MARA’s conviction in Bitcoin’s enduring value proposition. Repayment of $50 Million in Existing Debt: While $50 million might seem like a smaller slice of the pie, debt repayment is a crucial step for financial health. By reducing its existing liabilities, MARA improves its balance sheet, lowers its financial risk, and potentially enhances its creditworthiness for future endeavors. This demonstrates responsible financial management alongside aggressive growth. General Corporate Purposes: This broad category provides MARA with operational flexibility. It could encompass a range of uses, including: Investing in new, more efficient mining hardware and infrastructure. Expanding existing mining facilities or establishing new ones. Funding research and development into new mining technologies or energy solutions. Covering general operating expenses and ensuring smooth day-to-day business functions. This multi-pronged approach showcases a balanced strategy of growth (Bitcoin purchases, general corporate purposes) and financial prudence (debt repayment). The Broader Implications for Mara Bitcoin Mining and the Crypto Market MARA Holdings’ substantial convertible notes offering isn’t just a win for the company; it sends ripples across the entire crypto mining sector and the broader digital asset market. What does this mean? A Vote of Confidence: A $950 million raise, especially at 0% interest, is a strong signal that institutional investors have significant confidence in MARA’s business model and the long-term viability of Bitcoin mining. This can attract more investment into the sector.

2025-07-28 13:00:00+00:00,Bitcoin Rally Builds Amid US-China Tariff Pause,"For now, analysts are divided on whether Bitcoin can sustain this rebound, with some pointing to $119.5K as a crucial breakout level and others expecting a retest of lower support near $114.5K. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet doubled down on its Bitcoin strategy by purchasing an additional 780 BTC for $92 million, bringing its total to 17,132 BTC. The company’s aggressive BTC accumulation fueled a 246% year-to-date surge in its stock price, making it Japan’s top-performing stock with plans to expand into digital banking. Bitcoin Gains Ground Bitcoin surged past $119,000 on Sunday, staging an impressive rebound from two-week lows close to $114,500. The move reignited bullish momentum and started fresh discussions among traders about whether BTC could soon break above key resistance levels. BTC price action over the past 7 days (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Charts show BTC/USD approaching a critical reclaim area, with bulls trying to close the day above the 10-day simple moving average. This recovery came despite recent bearish pressure after one of the largest-ever Bitcoin sales, and coincided with news that the US and China agreed to postpone the implementation of new trade tariffs, which may have eased broader market tension. Crypto investor Ted Pillows commented that Bitcoin needs to decisively clear $119.5K for a breakout, and added that if it fails to do so, current consolidation could persist. He is optimistic that BTC might achieve this breakout next month, initiating the next leg higher. Popular analyst Rekt Capital pointed out that Bitcoin successfully closed above the lower boundary of its recent range, suggesting that the asset could be reentering a previously lost trading zone. He warned, however, that any pullbacks into that range low could serve as critical retests to confirm the move. Not all analysts are convinced the uptrend will hold without further tests to the downside. Trader CrypNuevo identified a potential mid-term target in the $114.5K–$113.6K range, which aligns with a concentration of order-book liquidity and prior liquidation zones. From this perspective, a revisit to lower support levels is still very much on the table. According to CoinGlass data , the current “max pain” point for short positions lies around $119,650. If BTC were to push back toward its all-time highs near $123,000, the resulting short liquidations could surpass $1.1 billion. Coinank''s own liquidity models also indicate strong resistance between $119,000 and $120,000 due to dense liquidation clusters at those levels. Adding to the volatility picture, analyst TheKingfisher warned that short-term price swings may become more pronounced. His gamma exposure analysis showed dealers heavily short gamma, a condition that tends to increase market turbulence as they hedge their positions. This dynamic suggests that traders should brace for amplified volatility in the immediate future. Metaplanet Buys More BTC Some companies are not too worried about whether BTC’s price will go up or down next. In fact, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet acquired an additional 780 Bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 17,132 BTC. The company revealed the purchase on Monday, and shared that it paid an average of approximately $118,145 per Bitcoin—just under the current trading price of $118,656. The total cost of the latest buy was about $92 million, and in total, Metaplanet invested roughly $1.7 billion in Bitcoin, with an average acquisition cost of $99,640 per coin. This strategic move places Metaplanet seventh on the list of top Bitcoin corporate treasuries worldwide. It sits just behind Trump Media & Technology Group, which holds 18,430 BTC, and ahead of Galaxy Digital Holdings, led by Michael Novogratz, which owns 12,830 BTC. While Metaplanet’s holdings are impressive, they still fall far short of Strategy, the global leader with over 607,770 BTC, valued at more than $72 billion. Top Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) Metaplanet made it clear that its Bitcoin purchases are part of a broader vision. Reports suggest the company plans to eventually leverage its digital assets to acquire cash-generating businesses, potentially including a digital bank in Japan. This approach reflects a tailored strategy, which CEO Simon Gerovich described in a recent Forbes Japan interview as “Japan-native,” designed to align with local regulatory and tax frameworks.

Brandt tells his 803,900 followers on the social media platform X that while most cryptocurrencies will eventually go to zero, one token he envisions becoming a “rock star” is the XRP ( XRP) rival Stellar ( XLM ). “Every crypto nerd has his/her/its own pet rock or Beanie Baby. I believe 95%+ of the 11,000 actively traded coins will become near worthless – your pet rock included. Already 3.7 million coins are dead (source: CoinGecko). Only about 50% of most actively traded cryptos are trading at greater than 10% of their peak value. One coin I think could become a rock star is XLM.” Source: Peter Brandt/X Looking at Brandt’s chart, he seems to suggest that XLM is gearing up to break out from a massive triangle pattern on the monthly chart. The chart also appears to suggest that Brandt is targeting $1.51 for XLM. XLM is trading for $0.452 at time of writing, a fractional decrease on the day. Moving on to silver (XAG), Brandt says the commodity could reach a staggering price – nearly twice its all-time high set in 1980 – if it can break through its current resistance level. “This is my long-term silver chart. While not technically a cup and handle, the chart nevertheless could support an advance to $95 per ounce if overhead resistance is hurdled. True for paper silver as well as physical silver.” Source: Peter Brandt/X According to Brandt, Silver needs to reach $100 per ounce just to keep pace with the growth of other assets. “For the record, I am long Silver. I am not a silver hater. The last big call I made on silver was to alert the world that [the] price was topping out at $50 an ounce back in 2011. Wow, in the last 14 years, silver’s been quite a performer. Silver needs to go to $100 an ounce just to catch up with the rest of the world.” Silver is valued at $38.42 per ounce at time of writing.

This outlook is supported by insights from Bitcoin’s weekly chart, which point to a strong rally that began after BTC rebounded from the 50-week Moving Average ( MA ) on April 7, 2025, according to analysis by TradingShot in a TradingView post published July 28.

Notably, this was the second time Bitcoin found support at the 0.236 Fibonacci level within this structure, an area historically tied to major bullish reversals. The current setup also mirrors earlier price movements. In late 2022 and again in early 2023, Bitcoin surged approximately 106.37% following similar technical signals. A more aggressive rally between late 2023 and early 2024 resulted in a 197.23% gain.

The feature went live on 28 July, marking a significant expansion of the firm’s digital finance strategy and targeting one of the most crypto-active countries in the region. The crypto top-up service was first introduced in Singapore in 2024. Its extension into the Philippines reflects both market readiness and growing consumer appetite for digital currencies in daily use. The development also places Grab among the few mainstream platforms in the Asia-Pacific region currently integrating decentralised payment options into everyday services. Grab partners with Triple-A and PDAX for crypto rollout Grab is enabling this functionality through a collaboration with Singapore-based payment processor Triple-A, a registered digital payment token service provider. The firm previously helped Grab pilot the same top-up feature in Singapore, where the response reportedly exceeded expectations. Triple-A’s platform is integrated with crypto wallets and exchanges, allowing for seamless fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat transactions. To facilitate local operations in the Philippines, Grab has partnered with the Philippine Digital Asset Exchange (PDAX), one of the country’s leading crypto trading platforms. PDAX’s involvement ensures compliance with local regulations and offers a familiar interface for local crypto users. With this move, Grab now sits at the intersection of fintech, mobility, and decentralised finance. Philippines among the global leaders in crypto adoption The Philippines continues to rank among the top countries for retail crypto adoption, driven by remittances, mobile-first internet penetration, and limited access to traditional banking. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has also provided a regulatory framework for virtual asset service providers (VASPs), which has encouraged domestic fintech development and consumer engagement. According to data from Triple-A, over 11.6 million Filipinos owned cryptocurrencies in 2024, accounting for more than 10% of the country’s adult population. The country also ranks third globally in terms of play-to-earn adoption and decentralised finance usage. The latest integration with Grab further enhances crypto utility across transportation, food delivery, and financial services. Broader shift in Southeast Asia toward digital assets The expansion of crypto payments into the Philippines is part of a broader regional trend. Companies like Grab are tapping into Southeast Asia’s fast-growing digital economy. With a young, mobile-first population, the region has emerged as a fertile ground for crypto-based solutions—especially where traditional banking infrastructure is limited. Triple-A’s ongoing partnership with Grab could see further rollouts across other Southeast Asian markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Malaysia. As central banks in the region explore digital currencies and clearer regulatory standards, mainstream apps offering crypto-based payment options may become more prevalent. Grab’s adoption of digital currencies for wallet top-ups reflects a larger shift towards embedding crypto in consumer ecosystems, not as an investment, but as a daily transaction tool.

The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty. It is measured in exahashes per second (EH/s). The profitability boost came as extreme summer heat across the U.S. drove up energy prices, prompting less efficient miners to throttle operations. So far in July, bitcoin has surged past $123,000, to set a new all-time high driven by increasingly favorable crypto regulation and a weakening U.S. dollar following tariff-related comments from President Donald Trump. The macro and regulatory backdrop has intensified investor interest and provided a fresh tailwind for mining firms, the report said. Despite the improved profitability, North American public miners saw a month-over-month decline in bitcoin production, analysts Jonathan Petersen and Jan Aygul wrote. In June, they mined a total of 3,382 BTC, down from 3,754 in May. They accounted for 25.1% of the global network, versus 26.3% the prior month, the report noted. MARA (MARA) led in output with 713 BTC mined, followed by CleanSpark with 685 tokens. MARA also maintained its lead in energized hashrate, posting 57.4 EH/s at the end of June, down slightly from May’s 58.3 EH/s. CLSK held the second-highest hashrate at 45.3 EH/s, the bank said.

2025-07-28 13:21:29+00:00,Why Vitalik Buterin Chose Transparency Over Anonymity in Building Ethereum,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained in an episode of The Network State podcast why, unlike Satoshi Nakamoto, he did not create the blockchain platform anonymously. Buterin said the decision stemmed from the peculiarities of that time. Buterin was 19 when he started working on Ethereum in 2013. He admitted that he hadn''t thought about anonymity, partly due to inexperience and eagerness. I was just a passionate developer with an idea and didn''t think about hiding my identity, he explained. However, the main reason was the desire to make the platform open to everyone, including developers and investors. Publicity helped. It was easier for me because I could speak at conferences, convey the essence of Ethereum, and build trust. Anonymity could have prevented the community from gathering in the early stages, Buterin noted. He also highlighted the difference in context. When Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin in 2008, cryptocurrencies were new and risky, and the government''s response was unclear. By 2013, the blockchain had become more understandable; the Ethereum founder said he was able to build the platform without worrying about potential risks. How can Ethereum be made even better? During the conversation, Buterin emphasized that the two main goals of the project remain scalability and utility, and a clear technical roadmap will help achieve them. Ethereum, broadly speaking, has two guiding stars. One is to be a widely used and scalable platform. The other is to remain truly valuable, meaning it''s significantly more secure and decentralized than the systems that people would use instead, he said. According to the programmer, if the platform cannot process millions of transactions or becomes similar to traditional finance, it will lose its value. To scale, Ethereum is developing L1 and L2 solutions. At the first level, developers are implementing preliminary block confirmation, access lists, and decentralized data storage. At the second level, they are increasing the number of BLOB-objects, using PeerDAS and technologies such as ZK-SNARKs and STARKs for transaction proofs. These technologies enable processing millions of transactions per second while maintaining the security of the network. Buterin noted the limitations of Bitcoin''s early ideas that Nakamoto did not fully consider: The main thing that I think Satoshi didn''t fully understand was the asymmetry between creation and verification. In the network of the first cryptocurrency, creating and verifying blocks require equal effort. However, technologies like ZK-SNARKs and data sampling allow the builder nodes to do the main work, simplifying verification for others. This reduces the load and makes the network accessible to more users. An example of failure is the use of custodial wallets in the Lightning Network in El Salvador, which reduced decentralization. Buterin proposed a hub model: The solution is a hub model, where a small number of powerful nodes concentrate the work of generating proofs, while verification remains widely distributed. L2 rollups perform computations outside the main blockchain but prove them on L1, providing the same guarantees. Data sampling allows the chain to be verified by downloading only a portion of the information, increasing scalability without losing decentralization. We are committed to continuing to move forward, making Ethereum better, more accessible, more secure, and more useful for everyone, Buterin concluded.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10217/why-vitalik-buterin-chose-transparency-over-anonymity-in-building-ethereum,ETH|BTC|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING,News|Ethereum,BTC,"Why Vitalik Buterin Chose Transparency Over Anonymity in Building Ethereum.

These technologies enable processing millions of transactions per second while maintaining the security of the network. Buterin noted the limitations of Bitcoin''s early ideas that Nakamoto did not fully consider: The main thing that I think Satoshi didn''t fully understand was the asymmetry between creation and verification. In the network of the first cryptocurrency, creating and verifying blocks require equal effort. However, technologies like ZK-SNARKs and data sampling allow the builder nodes to do the main work, simplifying verification for others. This reduces the load and makes the network accessible to more users. An example of failure is the use of custodial wallets in the Lightning Network in El Salvador, which reduced decentralization. Buterin proposed a hub model: The solution is a hub model, where a small number of powerful nodes concentrate the work of generating proofs, while verification remains widely distributed. L2 rollups perform computations outside the main blockchain but prove them on L1, providing the same guarantees. Data sampling allows the chain to be verified by downloading only a portion of the information, increasing scalability without losing decentralization. We are committed to continuing to move forward, making Ethereum better, more accessible, more secure, and more useful for everyone, Buterin concluded."

At Consensus 2025, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed that 1.2 billion NIGHT tokens will go to XRP holders as part of the Midnight network’s massive airdrop. With over 37 million wallets eligible, this could become the biggest airdrop in crypto history. But how much will you get, and how can you claim it? One Snapshot, One Chance The snapshot for the airdrop was already taken on June 11 to see who qualifies. If your XRP wallet had at least $100 worth of tokens at that time, you’re in. This isn’t just about XRP, Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, AVAX, and BAT holders are all part of this massive event. But XRP holders stand out with a dedicated 5% share of the 24 billion NIGHT tokens. However, this isn’t just about free tokens. Hoskinson believes this wide-reaching airdrop is a step toward uniting the crypto community. Instead of competing in silos, different blockchains are being connected through shared ownership in Midnight, a new privacy-focused network that runs on both NIGHT and DUST tokens. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : GrabPay Now Accepts BTC ETH USDC and USDT in the Philippines , When and How to Claim The claim portal went live on July 15 and will remain open for 60 days, closing sometime in mid-September. Anyone who misses the window won’t be left out, they can still recover their tokens through a mining-based system called the Scavenger Mine. However, unclaimed tokens will eventually go to Midnight’s treasury after four years. How Much Will XRP Holders Get? Out of the 24 billion NIGHT tokens available, XRP holders will receive 5%, which is 1.2 billion tokens. The amount each person receives depends on how much XRP they had during the snapshot. Cardano holders will get the most (50%), Bitcoin holders will get 30%, and the rest will be shared by other supported tokens. Why This Airdrop Matters Hoskinson said this is the largest airdrop ever based on the number of wallets involved, over 37 million. His goal is to bring different crypto communities together instead of competing. Meanwhile, Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, also shared support, saying Midnight’s privacy tech is “very interesting.” It shows that XRP, often seen as a payments coin, can play a much bigger role in the growing Web3 space. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-28 13:28:54+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Steady Around $118,000 As Fed Decision, Tech Earnings Loom","Bitcoin (BTC) steadied itself over the weekend while altcoins declined, entering a holding pattern ahead of the Fed decision on rate cuts, tech earnings, and crucial ETF data. The Fed is expected to announce its decision on interest rates, while tech earnings from major companies, including Microsoft and Amazon, could also impact market sentiment. ETF inflows have continued, but tariff tension could spark market volatility. Robert Kiyosaki Recommends Bitcoin ETFs For The Average Investor Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has recommended spot Bitcoin ETFs for average investors. However, he called them inferior to the real asset, and urged sophisticated investors to hold real gold, silver, and Bitcoin (BTC) above ETFs. The author said ETFs were like “having a picture of a gun for personal defense,” emphasizing their limitations compared to Bitcoin . Kiyosaki stated, “I realize ETFs make investing easier for the average investor, so I do recommend ETFs for the average investor. Yet I extend these words of caution. For the average investor, I recommend: Gold ETFs, Silver ETFs, and Bitcoin ETFs. Yet an ETF is like having a picture of a gun for personal defense. Sometimes it’s best to have real gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a gun. Know the differences when it is best to have real and when it’s best to have paper. If you know the differences and how to use them… you’re better than average.” Kiyosaki’s position highlights his conviction that traditional savings methods fail during monetary debasement. The author had recently outlined his intention to buy “one more Bitcoin” after the asset crossed $120,000. However, he warned investors against excessive greed while explaining his decision to pause purchases until the economic situation becomes clearer. Bitcoin Will No Longer Expect Parabolic Rallies Or Plunging Bear Markets Blockware Bitcoin analyst Mitchell Askew believes Bitcoin’s (BTC) parabolic rallies and devastating bear markets are a thing of the past thanks to Bitcoin ETFs. According to Askew, spot Bitcoin ETFs have permanently reduced volatility and altered market dynamics. The analyst stated, “ BTC /USD looks like two entirely different assets before and after the ETF. The days of parabolic bull markets and devastating bear markets are over. BTC is going to $1 million over the next 10 years through a consistent oscillation between ‘pump’ and ‘consolidate.’ It will bore everyone to death along the way and shake the tourists out of their positions.” According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, reduced volatility has helped Bitcoin attract even bigger fish, giving it a fighting chance at mainstream adoption. However, the tradeoff is that there will likely be no more “God Candles.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs isolate capital into traditional investment vehicles that lack in-kind redemption and keep funds off-chain. This prevents the rotation of capital into altcoins, which is something investors have come to expect from previous market cycles. Net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs crossed the $50 billion mark in July. However, the surge of capital into the asset has not translated into on-chain activity. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) faced substantial volatility last week, tumbling to an intraday low of $114,779 on Friday. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $117,565. The recovery continued over the weekend as the price registered a marginal increase on Saturday and then rose 1.31% on Sunday to cross $119,000 and settle at $119,398. The flagship cryptocurrency enters a crucial week, with several macroeconomic factors influencing price action. BTC is expected to react to the Fed’s decision on interest rates, which will be announced on Wednesday. Economists expect the Fed to leave interest rates unchanged between 4.25% and 4.50%. While the Fed believes the economy is doing alright, it remains concerned about the impact of Trump’s tariffs on inflation. Inflation has steadily picked up in the past few months, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising from 2.4% in June to 2.7% in July. The second catalyst for the flagship cryptocurrency will be the second-quarter earnings. The Magnificent 7, including Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Meta Platforms (META), will publish their earnings this week. Over 50% of all companies listed in the S&P 500 will publish their earnings this month. Market watchers believe that earnings growth has been more resilient than expected, explaining why the S&P 500 has reached record levels. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to register inflows, adding $72 million in inflows last week. While this has been the smallest weekly gain since June, Bitcoin ETFs continue to register strong investor interest.

2025-07-28 13:32:20+00:00,Interactive Brokers open to launching its own crypto offerings,"Interactive Brokers Group is considering creating its own digital token for customers, joining other big financial firms as U.S. regulators relax crypto rules. Founder of Interactive Brokers, Thomas Peterffy told Reuters that the company is evaluating methods to integrate stablecoins into its range of offerings. Although it hasn’t settled on a specific path, multiple options are under consideration for delivering these tokens directly to end users. As a major discount brokerage with a market capitalization of nearly $110 billion, the firm presently collaborates with Paxos for its crypto offerings and maintains a stake in the Zero Hash platform. Because of these partnerships, its clients currently have access to trading various cryptocurrencies via the platform. Peterffy added that the group is concentrating on facilitating 24/7, immediate top‑ups of brokerage accounts through stablecoins. Meanwhile, it is investigating smoother transfer mechanisms for widely held digital assets in and out of customer accounts. Among the proposals is permitting funding from stablecoins supplied by other established entities, contingent on those issuers satisfying specified criteria. Stablecoins represent digital units tied to underlying assets, often the U.S. dollar, and are intended to facilitate cross‑border value transfers outside conventional banking rails. However, detractors caution that these instruments can be misused by criminals to evade standard bank AML safeguards. ForecastEx expands Interactive Brokers’ innovation push Earlier in July, Robinhood launched a dollar‑backed token dubbed USDG as part of its Global Dollar Network alliance alongside firms like Kraken and Galaxy Digital. That move illustrates how fast the market for these tokens is growing. Along with stablecoins, the firm unveiled ForecastEx, a prediction‑market platform launched last year, enabling users to wager “yes” or “no” on diverse event outcomes. By the close of June, it reported roughly 3.87 million active accounts, marking a 32 % year‑over‑year increase. Elevated trading activity caused by tariff‑related market fluctuations has boosted the firm’s revenues. Since January, its stock has climbed approximately 47%, outpacing the S&P 500 Investment Banking & Brokerage index’s 20% gain in that interval. In a July 18 research update, Morningstar’s team said its prediction‑market and crypto moves offer a strategic counterbalance to potential volatility in its traditional equities, futures, and options sectors. IBKR founder stays cautious on crypto growth Peterffy has previously suggested allocating a modest 2–3% of one’s portfolio to Bitcoin, capping overall cryptocurrency exposure at 10%. He cautioned that although investors might benefit from some Bitcoin exposure, heavy concentrations expose holders to big price swings. He believed Bitcoin should stay outside the regular economy, even though Bitcoin futures have long been listed on the CME. After the tariff deal with the EU was confirmed, Bitcoin jumped above $120,000 for the first time in nearly two weeks. Just before that surge, it had been trading between $114,000 and $119,000. At $120,000, Bitcoin was only $3,080 away from its all‑time high. Peterffy’s recent comments underscore a cautious stance on rapid crypto expansion, but he hasn’t come to terms with the asset’s isolation from normal financial systems. “It’s basically hard to grasp its fundamental value. If we see people adopting it and ascribing a value to it, I’m okay with that, but I’m still not convinced,” he said.

Additionally, he hinted that the US might “wipe out” Iran fast if the Middle Eastern country restarts its nuclear program. With the rise of these geopolitical issues, the question now arises whether bitcoin’s uptrend is at risk. Recall that the POTUS set a 50-day ultimatum for Russia to conclude a peace deal with Ukraine on July 14, otherwise the largest nation by landmass will face “very severe tariffs.” Earlier today, reports emerged that Trump was disappointed by the lack of any progress being made on that front. Moreover, he threatened that there will be a new, shorter deadline for less than two weeks, which will be announced tomorrow. TRUMP ON RUSSIA: I’M GOING TO MAKE A NEW DEADLINE FOR ABOUT 10 OR 12 DAYS FROM TODAY TRUMP ON RUSSIA: WE JUST DON’T SEE ANY PROGRESS BEING MADE — *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) July 28, 2025 Building on the geopolitical tension, Trump touched upon the sensitive Iranian topic as well, as the country has been “sending out nasty signals.” According to Walter Bloomberg’s post, Trump warned that if Iran restarts its nuclear program, the US will “wipe it out fast.” Bitcoin’s price has historically reacted negatively to Trump’s warnings and threats against other countries, especially if there’s a potential war involved. It tapped a new all-time high after the Iran-Israel conflict ended and now trades inches below it. However, its progress could stall or be halted as a whole if there’s further escalation on each front. From a technical standpoint, BTC was already rejected today at a crucial resistance at $120,000, which pushed it south to roughly $118,500 as of now, where it filled one of the CME gaps. #Bitcoin rejects at the crucial resistance, again.

This pivotal moment, confirmed by Solid Intel on X, marks a significant step in the ongoing economic dialogue between the world’s two largest economies. For anyone tracking market shifts, from traditional stocks to the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, these discussions carry immense weight. What’s at stake, and how might these talks reshape the economic landscape we navigate? Understanding the Stakes: What Are These China-U.S. Trade Negotiations All About? For years, the relationship between China and the United States has been defined by a complex interplay of cooperation and competition, particularly in the economic sphere. Trade disputes, tariffs, and intellectual property concerns have often cast a shadow over global markets. These latest China-U.S. trade negotiations in Stockholm represent an effort to address these long-standing issues, aiming to find common ground that can foster more stable and predictable trade relations. While specific agendas are often kept under wraps, historical context suggests several key areas are likely on the table: Tariff Reductions: Discussions around the removal or reduction of tariffs imposed during previous trade wars. Intellectual Property Rights: Strengthening protections for patents, copyrights, and trademarks to prevent infringement. Market Access: Addressing barriers that restrict foreign companies from fully operating in each other’s markets. State Subsidies: Concerns over government support for domestic industries that may create unfair competitive advantages. Supply Chain Resilience: Efforts to diversify and secure global supply chains, especially in critical sectors. The very act of sitting down for these talks, especially in a neutral venue like Stockholm, signals a willingness from both sides to engage in constructive dialogue. This is a crucial first step, but the path to resolution is often fraught with challenges. Why Do China-U.S. Trade Negotiations Matter for the Global Economy? The economic health of China and the United States is inextricably linked to the global economy. Any significant shift in their trade relationship sends ripples across continents, affecting everything from manufacturing costs to consumer prices. These China-U.S. trade negotiations are not just about two countries; they are about setting the tone for international commerce and geopolitical stability. Here’s why their outcome is so vital: Impact on Global Supply Chains Many industries rely heavily on intricate global supply chains that crisscross both China and the U.S. Disruptions or uncertainties stemming from trade tensions can lead to: Increased Costs: Tariffs and trade barriers can raise the price of imported goods and components. Production Delays: Companies may struggle to source necessary parts or materials, leading to manufacturing slowdowns. Diversification Efforts: Businesses might seek to move production out of one country, a costly and time-consuming process. Inflationary Pressures Trade policies can directly influence inflation. If tariffs remain high or new trade barriers emerge, the cost of goods for consumers can rise. Conversely, a successful negotiation leading to tariff reductions could help ease inflationary pressures globally. Investor Confidence and Market Volatility Uncertainty in trade relations often translates into market volatility. Investors tend to shy away from risk when there’s a lack of clarity on future trade policies. Positive developments in China-U.S. trade negotiations can boost confidence, leading to market rallies, while negative news can trigger sell-offs. This sentiment often spills over into various asset classes, including commodities and digital currencies. Navigating the Hurdles: Challenges and Opportunities in China-U.S. Trade Negotiations While the start of talks is positive, the road ahead for China-U.S. trade negotiations is rarely smooth. Both nations come to the table with deeply entrenched economic interests and national security concerns. The challenges are significant: Deep-Seated Issues: Moving beyond surface-level agreements to tackle fundamental disagreements on economic models and intellectual property. Geopolitical Context: Trade talks are often intertwined with broader geopolitical tensions, making pure economic solutions harder to achieve. Domestic Pressures: Leaders on both sides face domestic political pressures that can influence their negotiating positions. However, opportunities also abound.

While the immediate focus might be on traditional equities, understanding these movements is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrency. The interconnectedness of these markets means that a strong showing in one often ripples into the other, creating both opportunities and challenges for investors. Understanding Today’s US Stock Market Performance The opening bell today brought smiles to investors as all major US indices posted gains, signaling a positive sentiment gripping the market. Here’s a quick look at the initial numbers: Index Change Today Significance S&P500 +0.09% Broad market indicator, representing large US companies. NASDAQ Composite +0.29% Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks. Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.10% Measures the performance of 30 significant US companies. These early gains suggest a prevailing optimism among investors, potentially driven by a confluence of factors. This positive US stock market performance can often be attributed to favorable economic data, strong corporate earnings reports, or perhaps anticipation of future monetary policy decisions. Understanding these underlying drivers is key to predicting broader market sentiment. What’s Fueling This Positive Momentum? Several factors typically contribute to an upward swing in the markets. When considering the current positive US stock market performance , we often look at: Economic Indicators: Positive reports on inflation, employment, or GDP growth can boost investor confidence, suggesting a healthy economic environment. Corporate Earnings: Stronger-than-expected earnings from major companies signal robust business health and profitability, encouraging investment. Monetary Policy Expectations: Anticipation of interest rate cuts or a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve can make borrowing cheaper and boost liquidity, fueling market rallies. Geopolitical Stability: A period of reduced global tensions or positive diplomatic developments can also contribute to a more stable investment climate. Today’s specific catalysts will become clearer as the day progresses, but the initial reaction points to a ‘risk-on’ appetite, where investors are more willing to take on riskier assets in pursuit of higher returns. The Interconnectedness: How Does US Stock Market Performance Impact Crypto? For a long time, cryptocurrencies were seen as an uncorrelated asset class, moving independently of traditional markets. However, in recent years, this narrative has shifted significantly. The increasing institutional adoption of digital assets and the entry of more mainstream investors have forged stronger links between the crypto market and traditional finance. Here’s how a strong US stock market performance can influence the crypto space: 1. Risk-On Sentiment and Capital Flow When traditional markets like the S&P500 and NASDAQ perform well, it often signals a ‘risk-on’ environment. In such periods, investors feel more confident about taking on higher-risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. This can lead to a flow of capital from safer havens into more speculative investments, potentially driving up crypto prices. Conversely, during ‘risk-off’ periods, capital tends to flow out of crypto and into perceived safer assets like the US dollar or bonds. 2. Institutional Adoption and Mainstream Integration As more institutional players—hedge funds, asset managers, and even public companies—allocate portions of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, the correlation with traditional markets strengthens. These institutions often view Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies as part of their broader investment strategy, making them susceptible to the same macroeconomic forces that drive stock markets. The performance of these traditional indices can therefore serve as a barometer for institutional appetite for digital assets. 3. Investor Confidence and Liquidity A booming stock market can boost overall investor confidence, making individuals and firms more comfortable with deploying capital across various asset classes. Increased liquidity in the broader financial system, often a byproduct of positive market sentiment, can also find its way into the crypto ecosystem, supporting higher trading volumes and price stability. Navigating Opportunities and Challenges While a positive US stock market performance can be a tailwind for crypto, it’s essential to consider both the opportunities and potential challenges: Opportunities for Crypto Investors: Increased Demand: A ‘risk-on’ environment can spur demand for cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to price appreciation for major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

One of them is PayPal, which is bringing cryptocurrency deeper into mainstream commerce. The payments giant has announced a new feature called “Pay With Crypto,” allowing U.S. merchants to accept over 100 cryptocurrencies at checkout. However, these are not insured by the FDIC or the SIPC. PayPal Reduces Cross-Border Costs to 0.99% The “Pay With Crypto” feature is designed to reduce transaction fees and widen the access to global customers. The press release revealed that merchants can now accept crypto from wallets like MetaMask, Binance, Coinbase, and others, while getting paid in U.S. dollars or PayPal’s stablecoin (PYUSD) instantly. PayPal will start by charging a 0.99% transaction fee for the first year, which will go up to 1.5% after that. The company says this is still low compared to typical fees for international credit card payments. PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said, “Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations. Today, we’re removing these barriers and helping every business of every size achieve their goals. He added, “By enabling seamless cross-border crypto payments, we’re breaking long-standing barriers in global commerce.” The feature supports major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, XRP, and Solana. Once a customer pays in crypto, the funds are converted in real time and deposited directly into the merchant’s PayPal account. No additional setup is required beyond enabling the option in PayPal’s business tools. PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, is likely to benefit from the regulatory clarity provided by the GENIUS Act, potentially leading to increased adoption and integration into PayPal’s services. PayPal’s PYUSD Faces Regulatory Review and Key Usage Risks PayPal’s new payment feature will even support popular memecoins like TRUMP and FARTCOIN. Depending on the type of token, PayPal will sell it on either a centralized exchange or a decentralized one like Uniswap, then send the merchant U.S. dollars. However, PYUSD has not received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) for use by New York residents. This means availability in New York may be limited until regulatory clearance is obtained. Importantly, PYUSD and other digital assets are not insured by the FDIC or SIPC. This lack of federal protection means users are exposed to greater financial risk in the event of service failure. The GENIUS Act has reshaped how stablecoins are used—moving them away from earning interest and focusing more on payments.

Speaking on the Master Investor podcast with Wilfred Frost, Dalio reiterated gold and Bitcoin can play a critical role in shielding wealth from the consequences of excessive money printing and loose monetary policy. He repeated his longstanding preference for gold but acknowledged Bitcoin as a viable diversifier. “I have gold, and I have some Bitcoin — but not much. I’m not going to describe my own portfolio, but I’ll say the following,” Dalio began. Dalio then laid out a framework for investors who want to optimize their portfolio against currency debasement: “If you were neutral on anything, and you were optimizing your portfolio for the best return‑to‑risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin. I’m strongly preferring gold to Bitcoin, but that’s up to you. Dalio says the issue is the devaluation of money “The issue is the devaluation of money. It’s an effective diversifier, so if you had no view, you would have about 15% of your portfolio as a hedge against the other.” Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, has long been vocal about his concerns regarding U.S. fiscal policy, ballooning national debt, and the erosion of purchasing power in fiat currencies.

2025-07-28 14:05:28+00:00,"Ether Treasuries Target Yield, but Risk Looms, Says Wall Street Broker Bernstein","Ether ETH treasury firms are emerging with a new playbook: Treat the cryptocurrency not just as a reserve asset, but as yield-generating capital. In recent months, several companies have unveiled ether treasury strategies that generate passive yield through ETH staking. These include BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR) and SharpLink Gaming (SBET). According to a report from Wall Street broker Bernstein published on Monday, these companies are structuring treasuries around the second-largest cryptocurrency, staking assets to earn operating income while supporting the network’s financial base. While bitcoin (BTC) treasuries like Strategy’s (MSTR) favor liquidity and passive holding, ether treasuries are leaning into staking yields, currently just under 3%, though historically ranging between 3%–5%, the report noted. A $1 billion ether treasury could generate $30million–$50 million in annual yield, Bernstein estimates. But with that income comes complexity. Ethereum’s staking model offers yield to holders rather than miners, requiring active capital deployment and more intensive risk oversight. Unlike Strategy''s highly liquid bitcoin reserves, ether staking introduces liquidity constraints. Unstaking can take days, creating potential mismatches in times of volatility. More advanced strategies, such as re-staking or decentralized finance-based (DeFi) yield farming, amplify smart contract and security risks, the report said. Treasury managers will need to balance yield optimization with institutional-grade custody and risk infrastructure. Still, Bernstein expects leading ether treasuries to manage these trade-offs effectively. With nearly 30% of ether supply staked and another 10% locked in DeFi, combined with ongoing ETF inflows, the report suggests strong structural demand for ETH in the near-to-medium term. Supply, meanwhile, remains relatively flat. The analysts remain bullish on ether and its ability to support treasury-scale capital strategies, as long as liquidity and risk are handled with discipline.

XRP in the Spotlight: What’s Driving Investor Interest in 2025 Ripple’s XRP is once again making headlines, trading around $3.14 after a strong recovery in Q2. Its growing adoption in institutional cross-border transactions and clearer U.S. regulatory positioning have boosted investor confidence. Analysts on Investing.com now forecast XRP to push toward $6 by year-end, with bullish targets as high as $10. For investors seeking passive exposure to XRP’s growth potential, Quid Miner provides a seamless, contract-free entry point. Redefining Access to Mining Founded in the UK in 2010, Quid Miner simplifies crypto mining for the modern investor. Users can mine top cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, and LTC—no hardware required. The platform’s AI engine dynamically allocates computing power for optimal efficiency, mirroring the professional infrastructure used by institutional miners. “Mining used to be a high-barrier activity,” a Quid Miner spokesperson noted. “We’ve changed that. Anyone can now earn crypto securely and efficiently in just a few taps.” Why Cloud Mining? Cloud mining allows users to lease computing resources from enterprise-grade data centers. This eliminates the need for technical setup, maintenance, or upfront hardware investment. Daily earnings are deposited directly into the user’s account, offering a hands-free stream of passive income. Why Quid Miner Stands Out As inflation, fluctuating interest rates, and global trade tensions reshape financial strategies, Quid Miner emerges as a practical solution for diversified income: AI Optimization Engine – Maximizes earnings by reallocating hash power across multiple coin pools Full Multi-Asset Support: BTC, ETH, XRP, DOGE, LTC, SOL, BCH, and USDT supported with multi-chain compatibility. Community Reward Mechanism: Recommend friends to participate in mining and get up to 4.5% rebate, realizing the dual income model of “mining + promotion”. Bank-grade security – Dual-layer protection with McAfee® and Cloudflare® for robust asset and data security. Mobile First: Full mining control via iOS or Android — manage operations anytime, anywhere. Simple steps to start cloud mining with Quid Miner 1.

Now, another penguin-themed project is exploding onto the scene and it’s already making noise. Bitcoin Penguins raised $187K in the first 90 seconds of its presale, kicking off what could be the fastest-moving meme coin campaign of the summer. Building on Bitcoin’s name, powered by penguins, and stacked with viral mechanics, BPENGU looks like a serious contender to follow in Pudgy Penguins’ footsteps. With a 30-day flash presale and a $10M hard cap, the project is racing toward a September 2nd listing and early buyers are betting this is the next 1000x opportunity. Memecoin meta has shifted fast in 2025. BONK surged 182% in a month. Even low-effort plays like Fartcoin have pumped. But the real story has been the rise of the penguins, with PENGU’s NFT revival now seen as the spark that reignited altseason. Bitcoin Penguins taps into two of the biggest narratives in crypto right now: Bitcoin dominance and penguin mania. It offers massive staking rewards, a BTC-BPENGU pair, and aims to build a meme empire complete with a community-driven plan to “buy Antarctica.” If you missed PENGU, this might be your best shot at catching the next penguin rocket early. What is Bitcoin Penguins? Bitcoin Penguins is a meme coin built for the two biggest trends of 2025: Bitcoin dominance and penguin mania. Pudgy Penguins took Ethereum. BPENGU is built for Bitcoin and it’s here to ride the wave. Launched on July 28th, Bitcoin Penguins kicked off a 30-day flash presale, offering 55% of its 10B supply to early buyers starting at just $0.00100. Prices increase every 2 days by 5%, and with demand already spiking, this one could hit its $10M cap well before September. But it’s not only hype. BPENGU is backed by real mechanics: 1 BTC weekly jackpots, 100% APY staking rewards, and an ambitious meme plan to literally buy Antarctica. The team is also set to launch a BTC-BPENGU trading pair, a first-of-its-kind meme-to-Bitcoin link that aligns perfectly with the season’s most explosive narratives. With Bitcoin pushing new highs and meme coins leading the charge, Bitcoin Penguins is aiming for a $1B FDV and 1000x returns by October. The rocket is fueled. It’s just a matter of how high it flies. Is Bitcoin Penguins (BPENGU) a good investment? The market is in full risk-on mode. The Greed Index is glowing, altseason is in motion, and momentum is snowballing far earlier than expected this year. This might have surprised some, especially as previous cycles have heated up more after the summer period. And the positive sentiment is triggering some incredibly bullish predictions for Q4 when things could really heat up. If the presale pace continues, BPENGU could become a potential monster heading into Q4’s euphoric phase. A chance at the next PENGU FOMO is inevitable in crypto, and BPENGU is going to leave heaps of it in its wake as it rockets through its presale. With more coins being minted than ever, picking the winners is a challenge, but in a world where those who shout the loudest win, Bitcoin Penguins frenzied raise indicates this could spread like wildfire. Bitcoin is breaking out. Meme coins are mooning. And BPENGU is the next one lining up to make headlines.

Analyst Explains Two Possible Scenarios!,"The FED interest rate decision, which is followed with great curiosity in the Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrency markets, will be announced this week. The Fed will announce this month''s interest rate decision on Wednesday, July 30. The market is generally pricing in a 97.4% probability that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged in July, while the probability of a 25 basis point hike is priced in at just 2.6%. While no surprise decision is expected from the Fed this week, crypto analyst Paul Barron noted that there is a small possibility of a surprise interest rate cut. Despite the general market expectation, the analyst predicted that the Fed could make a surprise interest rate cut in July, which could lead to massive gains in stocks, real estate and cryptocurrencies. At this point, Paul Barron outlined what could happen if the Fed unexpectedly cuts interest rates at this week''s FOMC meeting. The analyst said that a surprise move could lead to massive gains in many sectors, especially BTC and altcoins. Historically, the S&P 500 has performed well after such cuts, according to the analyst. However, a surprise interest rate cut could have a significant impact on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; lower interest rates generally benefit riskier assets. Although some altcoins like XRP and Cardano (ADA) are facing profit-taking, they could regain upward momentum with the interest rate cut. While the rate cut sounds optimistic for markets, the analyst also outlined potential downsides. One of the biggest risks is rising inflation. He also noted that if the Fed cuts interest rates this month, it could signal economic weakness, fuel consumer insecurity, and wouldn''t be good news for consumers.

2025-07-28 14:24:10+00:00,"PayPal launches crypto checkout for US merchants, accepting 100+ coins including BTC","PayPal has rolled out a new crypto payment feature in the US, enabling merchants to accept more than 100 cryptocurrencies at checkout, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. The move comes amid growing regulatory clarity following the introduction of the GENIUS Act , which has spurred major financial companies to expand their digital asset offerings. Branded as “ Pay With Crypto ,” the feature is being offered with a 0.99% transaction fee for the first year, giving PayPal merchants an alternative to traditional cross-border payment methods. Merchants can now accept Bitcoin, Ethereum, and memecoins The Pay With Crypto feature allows US merchants to receive payments in US dollars or PayPal USD (PYUSD) after customers pay using cryptocurrencies through third-party wallets like MetaMask, Binance, and Coinbase. The list of supported coins includes Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, XRP, Solana, and even memecoins such as TRUMP and FARTCOIN. Unlike traditional cross-border payments, which often carry high processing fees and delays, the crypto checkout system converts crypto to fiat in real time and deposits the funds directly into the merchant’s account. This eliminates the need for merchants to manage cryptocurrency wallets or go through separate exchanges. For the first 12 months, PayPal will charge merchants a reduced transaction fee of 0.99%, increasing to 1.5% thereafter. By comparison, international credit card payments often attract fees in the range of 2% to 4%, making PayPal’s offering competitive for small and medium-sized businesses engaging in global commerce. PayPal stablecoin PYUSD at centre of integration PayPal’s stablecoin PYUSD plays a key role in this new offering, serving as a bridge between crypto assets and fiat currencies. Payments made in unsupported or volatile tokens may be routed through decentralised exchanges like Uniswap before being converted to PYUSD or USD for merchants. However, PYUSD is still undergoing regulatory scrutiny. It has not yet received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), limiting its availability for New York-based users and businesses. This regulatory gap could affect early adoption in one of the US’s most active financial markets. Moreover, PYUSD and all supported cryptocurrencies on Pay With Crypto are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). This means users and merchants are exposed to asset loss in case of technical failure or insolvency. GENIUS Act drives stablecoin shift towards payments The feature launch follows the passage of the GENIUS Act, which limits interest-earning on stablecoins and refocuses their use toward payments and trading. As a result, issuers like PayPal are redesigning their offerings to prioritise speed, low fees, and integration into real-world transactions. The GENIUS Act has also provided clearer legal parameters for companies operating in the stablecoin space. While PYUSD is yet to secure full approval in all jurisdictions, the broader framework has encouraged PayPal and others to invest in crypto infrastructure for global trade. Cross-border crypto payments expected to grow The introduction of Pay With Crypto comes at a time when businesses are actively seeking low-cost, compliant alternatives to move money across borders. Traditional options often involve intermediaries, long settlement times, and conversion losses. In contrast, crypto transactions can settle within minutes and reduce reliance on banking networks. By simplifying integration and enabling auto-conversion, PayPal’s new feature could position it as a leading gateway for crypto payments in retail. The long-term success, however, will depend on regulatory approvals, stablecoin trust, and market response from both merchants and customers.

The move, first reported by Bloomberg , marks an escalation of the company''s already aggressive crypto strategy. It now combines traditional holdings with high-risk options linked to exchange-traded funds (ETFs), blockchain equities, and convertible bonds.This allows TMTG to profit from price movements across the crypto sector without increasing its direct Bitcoin stake. It''s a calculated bet on market volatility that could bring significant upside. However, if prices dip, the company could be left with worthless contracts.$2 Billion in Holdings and a Bet on Market TimingEven before this latest investment, TMTG held around $2 billion in Bitcoin and related assets, accounting for roughly two-thirds of its liquid reserves. Now, with the addition of derivatives, the company is embracing a two-pronged strategy. It aims to hedge against short-term price fluctuations while remaining committed to Bitcoin in the long term.Experts Warn of Policy-Market OverlapThe investment has sparked ethical concerns, especially given Trump’s outsize influence in both political and digital spheres. His social media posts on Truth Social have previously moved crypto markets. Most notably, in March, his call for a U.S. Bitcoin reserve sent Bitcoin and Ethereum prices soaring.With TMTG now financially positioned to benefit from such price movements, analysts are warning that the overlap between Trump’s political clout and his business interests could create serious conflicts of interest. “When someone with market-moving power also holds a financial stake, the incentive structure gets murky,” said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. “Derivatives only amplify that risk.” Nick Carter, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, echoed those concerns, noting that Trump’s dual roles as a political leader and a crypto-adjacent business figure could distort market conditions if left unchecked.A Broader Pro-Crypto AgendaThe move is not happening in isolation. Trump and his allies have recently ramped up pro-crypto rhetoric, including backing the GENIUS Act and proposing a federally backed Bitcoin reserve. TMTG’s financial moves align with this broader vision, positioning the company at the intersection of political messaging and cryptocurrency strategy.While a handful of public companies hold Bitcoin, few are deploying derivatives at this scale, making TMTG’s approach both unconventional and risk-laden.White House Pushes Back Amid Industry SkepticismIn response to mounting criticism, White House spokesperson Seth Fields stated that “President Trump has never been involved in conflicts of interest and will never be involved.” However, many in the financial community remain unconvinced, citing the unprecedented mix of public influence and private capital exposure.",thecryptobasic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/07/28/trump-media-invests-300-million-in-bitcoin-linked-derivatives/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=trump-media-invests-300-million-in-bitcoin-linked-derivatives,MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|FIAT,Market|Donald Trump and Crypto: News|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today,BTC,"Trump Media Invests $300 Million in Bitcoin-Linked Derivatives.

In a new report seen by the Financial Times , Citigroup analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert offer a new way of valuing digital assets, ostensibly suggesting that the price of Bitcoin is influenced simply by how many people want to own it. While Citi’s previous Bitcoin price models incorporated various data inputs like mining electricity costs, adoption rates and more, the analysts have updated their forecast to account for the reality that crypto assets are very much a part of the traditional macroeconomic picture, rather than an isolated subset without relevance to the average investor’s portfolio. “Around the fall of FTX, the majority of client questions were, ‘How does crypto effect MY market or the macroeconomy?’ – the answer then was, probably not much. We think that is changing. Firstly, crypto assets have grown and now represent a more meaningful amount of capital. Crypto market-caps now rival all but the largest-cap equity names. Secondly, crypto-related assets are now meaningful parts of some of the largest financial indices. Crypto-related securities are now members of the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell. Importantly, this means even crypto-agnostic clients need to have a view to manage their portfolios.” Citi now has a “bull case” price target of $199,340 for BTC at the end of this year, a “base case” for $135,133, and a “bear” case for $63,675. Source: Citi/The Financial Times As of late, the analysts say that the price of BTC is primarily driven by one factor. The Citi analysts say that the net weekly flows into Bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have had a “very strong contemporaneous relationship” with the returns on BTC. “Since launch, 41% of Bitcoin return variation can be explained by flows alone (the relationship is just as strong even accounting for equity returns). So far this year, we have seen just over $19 billion of flows, including $5.5 billion month-to-date. We expect flows to continue for the rest of the year as more institutions approve and potentially advise underlying clients on these vehicles. There is significant uncertainty around these flows; we forecast $15 billion given the pace seen so far year-to-date. This would slightly exceed last year’s launch, but the recent acceleration in flows presents upside risk – given each $1 billion of weekly flows is associated with a 3.6% return increase, flows have a meaningful impact on our forecast.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-28 14:30:34+00:00,Crypto Debate Heats Up As US Lawmakers Question FHFA Home Loan Policy,"A new political debate is unfolding as a group of Senate Democrats has officially raised concerns about the growing intersection of crypto and the US housing market. The lawmakers sent a letter to William Pulte, Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), challenging his recent directive that asks Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to submit proposals for including unconverted cryptocurrency assets in mortgage underwriting decisions. This marks a potential shift in how digital assets could influence loan eligibility and financial risk assessments. The senators—led by Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders—warn that the inclusion of volatile and largely unregulated crypto holdings in underwriting processes may pose significant dangers to consumers and the broader housing market. They argue the directive lacks sufficient detail on how these proposals will be developed, evaluated, or regulated, creating uncertainty and possible systemic risks. Under current rules, only converted crypto with proper documentation can be considered in mortgage applications. Including unconverted assets, critics say, opens the door to volatility , liquidity risks, and potential loss from scams or hacks. With Pulte also chairing the boards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, questions around conflict of interest and procedural oversight are intensifying. Senators Raise Red Flags Over Crypto In Mortgage Underwriting In their sharply worded letter, the senators highlighted that current federal guidelines prohibit the use of unconverted cryptocurrency in mortgage underwriting. “Expanding underwriting criteria to include the consideration of unconverted cryptocurrency assets could pose risks to the stability of the housing market and the financial system,” the senators warned. They argue that crypto’s volatility, lack of regulatory clarity, and limited liquidity—especially during market downturns—could amplify risks for both lenders and borrowers. As the letter notes, “a borrower using crypto faces an increased risk that they may not be able to exit a crypto position and convert to cash at a price that would allow them to buffer against risk of mortgage default.” The lawmakers argue that the recent directive from FHFA Director William Pulte could disrupt the financial system’s stability by enabling lenders to consider unconverted crypto assets—assets that are volatile, hard to value in real-time, and prone to liquidity constraints. Beyond financial concerns, the senators also questioned potential conflicts of interest between Pulte, the Trump Administration, and the cryptocurrency industry, particularly regarding his dual role as FHFA Director and Chair of the Enterprises’ Boards. These overlapping positions could allow for outsized influence in approving policies that lack independent scrutiny. As the US inches closer to integrating this asset class into traditional financial frameworks, this letter signals intensifying scrutiny from lawmakers. With institutional adoption growing and regulatory frameworks evolving, the coming weeks will be crucial for determining how the US government balances innovation with systemic financial stability. Total Market Cap Approaches $4 Trillion The weekly chart of the total crypto market cap reveals a powerful uptrend, with the market currently sitting at $3.89 trillion—just shy of the psychological $4 trillion mark. After a steep rally that began in late 2023, the market has continued to push higher with strong bullish momentum, confirming a breakout from its previous consolidation phase. All major moving averages (50, 100, and 200) are trending upward, and the price remains well above them. This suggests a healthy structure in both short- and long-term perspectives. The 50-week SMA at $2.95 trillion is now acting as solid macro support, underlining the strength of the current cycle. Notably, this level also aligns with the prior all-time high region from early 2022, now flipped into support—an important technical signal in bullish cycles. Volume is increasing in the up weeks, confirming buying interest as the market gains traction.

2025-07-28 14:30:37+00:00,BTC Drops to $118K Amid Institutional Selling But WeWake Stuns Investors With a Big Launch,"As Bitcoin slipped to $118,000 amid rising institutional sell pressure, fresh energy has arrived from one of the newest crypto presale projects, WeWake Finance. While most eyes are on BTC’s fluctuations, WeWake has launched its presale cryptocurrency with clear user benefits and a strong technical foundation. This new crypto token presale completed its Stage 2 quickly and is already deep into Stage 3, showing early demand for user-first infrastructure. The WeWake platform removes two of the biggest hurdles to crypto adoption, wallet setup and gas fees. By allowing users to join with just a social login, it is making Web3 intuitive and simple. As investors scan the crypto presale list for utility-based innovation, WeWake is emerging as a top crypto presale to watch. The current price stands at $0.0130, with the next stage moving up to $0.0145. Over $100,000 has already been raised. WeWake Delivers a Gasless, Wallet-Free Crypto Experience WeWake Finance introduces a plug-and-play solution that simplifies access to crypto for the masses. Instead of using browser wallets or remembering seed phrases, users can log in using Google or Telegram and start interacting with dApps instantly. The entire process is gasless, meaning users never pay transaction fees. This approach makes WeWake accessible to those new to crypto. Without the usual barriers, more users can participate in token swaps, play games, claim airdrops, or join DAOs. Community members can vote without holding gas tokens or paying fees, increasing engagement and participation. WeWake’s Layer 2 design focuses on scaling Web3 access while maintaining speed and security. By eliminating technical friction, it reduces drop-off rates and boosts user conversion. The Stage 3 presale price is currently $0.0130, and with $100k already raised out of $110,000, momentum is clearly building. This new crypto presale is gaining attention among those looking to buy presale crypto that solves real problems. BTC Sees Pressure Amid Broader Market Movements Bitcoin (BTC) has slipped to $115,000 after a short rally. Institutional activity and macroeconomic concerns have driven some selling across the crypto market, which has created temporary price pressure. The BTC price drop comes as traders eye new support zones and rebalance portfolios. Despite this, trading volume remains high, signaling continued interest and engagement. Bitcoin’s correction has encouraged investors to diversify, often leading them to look at crypto coins on presale. Token presales tend to offer entry at lower price points with strong utility potential. With Bitcoin in a correction phase, some investors are exploring new crypto token presales with long-term value. Platforms like WeWake provide a different kind of opportunity, rooted in accessibility, user experience, and functional use cases. WeWake’s Approach to Simpler, Scalable Blockchain Use WeWake isn’t just about making transactions easier, it’s about making crypto more human.

As Bitcoin slipped to $118,000 amid rising institutional sell pressure, fresh energy has arrived from one of the newest crypto presale projects, WeWake Finance. While most eyes are on BTC’s fluctuations, WeWake has launched its presale cryptocurrency with clear user benefits and a strong technical foundation. This new crypto token presale completed its Stage 2 quickly and is already deep into Stage 3, showing early demand for user-first infrastructure. The WeWake platform removes two of the biggest hurdles to crypto adoption, wallet setup and gas fees. By allowing users to join with just a social login, it is making Web3 intuitive and simple. As investors scan the crypto presale list for utility-based innovation, WeWake is emerging as a top crypto presale to watch. The current price stands at $0.0130, with the next stage moving up to $0.0145. Over $100,000 has already been raised. WeWake Delivers a Gasless, Wallet-Free Crypto Experience WeWake Finance introduces a plug-and-play solution that simplifies access to crypto for the masses. Instead of using browser wallets or remembering seed phrases, users can log in using Google or Telegram and start interacting with dApps instantly. The entire process is gasless, meaning users never pay transaction fees. This approach makes WeWake accessible to those new to crypto. Without the usual barriers, more users can participate in token swaps, play games, claim airdrops, or join DAOs. Community members can vote without holding gas tokens or paying fees, increasing engagement and participation. WeWake’s Layer 2 design focuses on scaling Web3 access while maintaining speed and security. By eliminating technical friction, it reduces drop-off rates and boosts user conversion. The Stage 3 presale price is currently $0.0130, and with $100k already raised out of $110,000, momentum is clearly building. This new crypto presale is gaining attention among those looking to buy presale crypto that solves real problems. BTC Sees Pressure Amid Broader Market Movements Bitcoin (BTC) has slipped to $115,000 after a short rally. Institutional activity and macroeconomic concerns have driven some selling across the crypto market, which has created temporary price pressure. The BTC price drop comes as traders eye new support zones and rebalance portfolios. Despite this, trading volume remains high, signaling continued interest and engagement. Bitcoin’s correction has encouraged investors to diversify, often leading them to look at crypto coins on presale. Token presales tend to offer entry at lower price points with strong utility potential. With Bitcoin in a correction phase, some investors are exploring new crypto token presales with long-term value. Platforms like WeWake provide a different kind of opportunity, rooted in accessibility, user experience, and functional use cases. WeWake’s Approach to Simpler, Scalable Blockchain Use WeWake isn’t just about making transactions easier, it’s about making crypto more human.

2025-07-28 14:35:11+00:00,Fed Rate Cuts: Trump’s Bold Call to Unleash Economic Growth,"BitcoinWorld Fed Rate Cuts: Trump’s Bold Call to Unleash Economic Growth In the dynamic world of global finance, few statements grab headlines quite like those from influential political figures regarding monetary policy. Recently, former U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on a topic of immense interest to markets worldwide: the potential for Fed Rate Cuts . His assertion that the U.S. economy, while already performing well, would ‘improve further’ with a rate reduction, and his direct call for the Federal Reserve to act ‘this week,’ has ignited considerable discussion. But what exactly do these comments signify for the broader economy, and perhaps more pertinently for our audience, what could they mean for the volatile and fascinating cryptocurrency market? What Exactly Did Trump Say About Fed Rate Cuts ? Donald Trump’s recent remarks were direct and unequivocal. He stated that despite the current economic strength, the United States economy would experience an even greater boost if the Federal Reserve were to lower its benchmark interest rates. This isn’t a new stance for the former President; during his time in office, he frequently criticized the Fed for not cutting rates more aggressively, arguing that higher rates were stifling economic potential. His latest comments underscore a consistent belief that lower borrowing costs are a key ingredient for accelerated economic expansion. He views the current economic performance as robust, but sees significant untapped potential that could be unlocked through monetary easing. This perspective often aligns with a desire to stimulate investment, consumer spending, and overall business activity. Understanding the Federal Reserve’s Role and the Power of Fed Rate Cuts To fully grasp the implications of Trump’s call, it’s essential to understand the Federal Reserve’s role. The Fed, as the central bank of the United States, has a dual mandate: to maximize employment and maintain stable prices (control inflation). It achieves these goals primarily through adjusting the federal funds rate, which influences interest rates throughout the economy. How Interest Rates Work: When the Fed raises rates, borrowing becomes more expensive for banks, businesses, and consumers. This can cool down an overheating economy and combat inflation. Conversely, when the Fed implements Fed Rate Cuts , borrowing becomes cheaper, encouraging spending and investment. Stimulating Growth: Lower rates mean cheaper mortgages, car loans, and business loans. This incentivizes individuals to buy homes and cars, and companies to expand, hire more staff, and invest in new projects. Controlling Inflation: The delicate balance lies in stimulating growth without triggering excessive inflation. Too much money chasing too few goods can lead to rising prices, eroding purchasing power. The Fed’s decisions are based on a complex assessment of economic data, including inflation rates, employment figures, GDP growth, and global economic conditions. They aim for a ‘soft landing’ – guiding the economy without causing a recession or runaway inflation. What Are the Potential Benefits of Fed Rate Cuts for the Economy? A reduction in interest rates, as advocated by Trump, is generally seen as a powerful tool to inject liquidity and stimulate various sectors of the economy. Here are some key potential benefits: Lower Borrowing Costs: For businesses, this means cheaper loans for expansion, equipment, and innovation. For consumers, it translates to lower mortgage rates, reduced credit card interest, and more affordable car loans, freeing up disposable income. Increased Investment: With lower borrowing costs and a potentially brighter economic outlook, businesses are more likely to invest in new projects, expand operations, and create jobs. This can lead to a virtuous cycle of growth. Boost to Consumer Spending: Cheaper credit and increased confidence often lead to higher consumer spending, which is a major driver of economic activity. People might be more inclined to make big purchases or take on new debt for consumption. Stronger Exports: Lower interest rates can sometimes lead to a weaker domestic currency, making a country’s exports more competitive on the global market. This can benefit export-oriented industries and improve the trade balance. Higher Asset Valuations: Lower rates can make equities and other assets more attractive compared to fixed-income investments, potentially boosting stock market performance and wealth for investors. Are There Any Risks or Challenges Associated with Aggressive Fed Rate Cuts ? While the benefits of rate cuts can be appealing, the Federal Reserve must also consider the potential downsides and risks. An overly aggressive or ill-timed easing can lead to unintended consequences: Inflationary Pressures: If the economy is already strong, significant rate cuts could lead to too much money chasing too few goods, resulting in inflation that erodes purchasing power.

The Bridgewater Associates founder revealed during a Master Investor podcast appearance that the U.S. government spends $7 trillion annually while collecting only $5 trillion in revenue, resulting in a $ 2 trillion deficit that requires $12 trillion in new debt sales over the next year. Interest payments alone consume $1 trillion annually, accounting for half of the budget deficit.

The federal debt stands at six times annual revenue, while the government cannot meaningfully reduce spending due to fixed obligations. Federal Debt: Total Public Debt Source: Fred The billionaire expressed a strong preference for gold over Bitcoin, noting gold’s status as the second-largest reserve currency globally. “ If you were neutral on everything and optimizing your portfolio for the best return-to-risk ratio, you would have about 15% of your money in gold or Bitcoin ,” Dalio stated. However, he acknowledged Bitcoin’s perceived value as an alternative currency with a limited supply and global transaction benefits, while questioning its effectiveness as a central bank reserve currency due to concerns about privacy. Dalio’s recommendation comes as Bitcoin trades near $119,000, with technical analysis suggesting the cryptocurrency may be poised for a final rally toward cycle highs between $135,000 and $155,000.

Dalio emphasized that similar patterns preceded the decline of previous reserve currencies, including the British pound and Dutch guilder. The federal government debt has reached 125% of GDP, with a fiscal deficit of 7% of GDP, the highest among industrialized nations. Federal Debt: Total Public Debt as Percent of Gross Domestic Product Source: Fred Dalio proposed a “3% solution,” requiring immediate action to reduce the deficit from 7.5% to 3% of GDP through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts. The debt doom loop affects capital flows as higher taxation drives wealthy individuals to relocate, creating a vicious cycle. Approximately 75% of income taxes are paid by the top 10% of earners, meaning losing 5% of this population could eliminate 35% of tax revenue. Historical precedents include the U.S. successfully reducing its budget deficit by 5% of GDP between 1991 and 1998; however, Dalio expressed skepticism about the political willingness to implement the necessary fiscal discipline. The mechanics indicate that without corrective action, the debt accumulation will accelerate beyond manageable levels. Central banks worldwide face similar pressures, leading to coordinated currency debasement rather than competitive devaluations. All major fiat currencies are expected to decline together relative to hard assets like gold, creating the classic devaluation scenario Dalio describes.

Kiyosaki’s comments come as the U.S. national debt hits historic levels. This month alone, debt rose by $367 billion, reaching $36.6 trillion, an all-time high. The jump followed President Trump’s approval of a sweeping spending bill that raised the debt ceiling by $5 trillion.

The company skipped its weekly BTC purchase for the first time since July 7, when the quarterly reporting delayed the purchase on technicalities.

The oversubscribed placement suggests Strategy has not lost any of its appeal, and there is mostly optimism about its ability to continuously turn cash into BTC. The past week saw BTC show some weakness, dipping to $115,000. However, this was not due to lower spot demand, but mostly a result of liquidated long positions.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s New Clock: How Wall Street Killed The Old Cycle, According To Expert According to PayPal, businesses can save up to 90% on transaction costs when buyers pay with digital coins. Flat Fees For Crypto Payments Based on reports, every sale automatically converts crypto into fiat or stablecoins when the merchant chooses. Companies can pick from more than 100 tokens under its “Pay with Crypto” feature. Bitcoin and Ethereum lead the list. Other picks include USDT, XRP, BNB, Solana and PayPal’s own PYUSD. That stablecoin is backed by US dollar deposits, short‑term Treasuries and cash equivalents.

The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic shifts, has once again captured attention as the Bitcoin price experienced a notable dip. Recent market monitoring indicates that BTC has fallen below the significant $118,000 mark, with trading recorded at $117,970.31 on the Binance USDT market. This movement has sparked discussions among investors and enthusiasts alike, prompting a closer look at what this latest development means for the world’s leading cryptocurrency and the broader digital asset landscape. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Movement For many, the sight of a Bitcoin price correction can be unsettling, yet it’s a characteristic feature of volatile markets. This recent dip, while sharp, is part of Bitcoin’s historical tendency for significant price swings. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, the drop below $118,000 marks a key psychological and technical level that investors often watch closely. It’s crucial to understand that such movements are rarely isolated events; they are often influenced by a confluence of factors. While the immediate trigger for this specific drop might be complex, market corrections are a natural part of any asset class, especially one as nascent and rapidly evolving as cryptocurrency. Traders and analysts constantly monitor support and resistance levels, and a breach of a major support level, like $118,000, can trigger further selling pressure as automated trading systems and human traders react. What Factors Influence Bitcoin Price Volatility? The journey of Bitcoin price is influenced by a complex interplay of global economic, technological, and psychological factors. When we see a sudden drop, it’s natural to ask: what’s truly behind this sudden dip? Here are some common drivers: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic uncertainty, inflation concerns, interest rate changes, or a strengthening U.S. dollar can often lead investors to de-risk, moving away from volatile assets like Bitcoin into safer havens. Regulatory News: Announcements or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can cause significant jitters in the market, leading to sell-offs as investors anticipate potential restrictions. Market Sentiment and FUD: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) can spread rapidly through social media and news cycles, triggering panic selling even without a fundamental change in Bitcoin’s underlying value. Conversely, positive news can fuel a buying frenzy. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly impact the market with their buying or selling activities. A large sell-off by a whale can quickly depress the Bitcoin price . Technical Analysis: Breaking key support levels, as we’ve seen with the $118,000 mark, can trigger algorithmic trading strategies designed to sell when certain price points are breached, accelerating a downward trend. Liquidity and Exchange Activity: Issues on major exchanges, such as liquidity crunches or large liquidation events, can also contribute to sudden price movements. Navigating the Waters: What Should Investors Do During a Bitcoin Price Dip? For both seasoned and novice investors, a dip in the Bitcoin price can be a test of resolve. Instead of panic, it often presents an opportunity for strategic re-evaluation. Here are some actionable insights: 1. Reassess Your Investment Strategy It’s crucial to stick to your long-term investment goals. If you’re a long-term holder, short-term fluctuations might be less concerning. If you’re a short-term trader, this might be a signal to adjust your positions based on your risk tolerance. 2. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) DCA involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset’s price. This strategy helps mitigate the risk of buying at a peak and can be particularly effective during market downturns, allowing you to accumulate more Bitcoin at a lower average price. 3. Diversify Your Portfolio While Bitcoin is a cornerstone of many crypto portfolios, diversification across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can help cushion the impact of a single asset’s decline. However, remember that diversification does not guarantee profits or protect against losses. 4. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed Follow reliable news sources like Bitcoin World and avoid making impulsive decisions based on sensational headlines or social media chatter. Understanding the underlying reasons for market movements is key. 5. Manage Risk Effectively Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders if you are trading actively to limit potential losses, and always be prepared for the possibility of further price declines.

Diversify Your Portfolio While Bitcoin is a cornerstone of many crypto portfolios, diversification across different cryptocurrencies or asset classes can help cushion the impact of a single asset’s decline. However, remember that diversification does not guarantee profits or protect against losses. 4. Stay Informed, Not Overwhelmed Follow reliable news sources like Bitcoin World and avoid making impulsive decisions based on sensational headlines or social media chatter. Understanding the underlying reasons for market movements is key. 5. Manage Risk Effectively Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders if you are trading actively to limit potential losses, and always be prepared for the possibility of further price declines. The Road Ahead: What Does the Future Hold for Bitcoin Price? Predicting the exact future of the Bitcoin price is impossible, given the inherent volatility and numerous influencing factors. However, historical data"

2025-07-28 15:00:16+00:00,Ethereum Quiet Takeover: How Declining BTC Dominance Is Fueling ETH’s Rise,"Ethereum is steadily gaining ground as Bitcoin’s dominance continues to decline, signaling a quiet shift in market power. As ETH captures a larger share of the crypto landscape, key support and resistance levels are now in focus, pointing to potential for further upside. Ethereum Captures Larger Market Slice as BTC Weakens In a recent update on X, The Boss pointed out that Ethereum’s dominance in the crypto market is steadily increasing, aligning with previous expectations. As Bitcoin dominance begins to slip, Ethereum is gaining momentum, gradually capturing a larger share of the total market capitalization. This shift highlights the growing confidence in Ethereum’s relative strength compared to Bitcoin under current market conditions. Related Reading: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Says Ethereum Will Enter Price Discovery If It Takes Out This Level The Boss also emphasized the technical significance of a green line marked on the dominance chart, identifying it as a key support zone. As long as Ethereum dominance remains above this level, the bullish outlook remains intact. This support has previously acted as a reliable floor during past consolidations, and holding above it could provide the foundation for further gains in dominance. Attention is now turning to potential resistance zones, which The Boss illustrated using yellow lines derived from Fibonacci retracement levels. These levels represent likely areas where ETH dominance could face selling pressure or hesitation. However, surpassing them could indicate further strengthening of Ethereum’s position in the market. Overall, The Boss’s analysis suggests that the decline in Bitcoin dominance may be fueling Ethereum’s rise, and the technical setup remains favorable for ETH as long as it stays above the highlighted support. ETH Eyes Key Resistance Zone At $3,900 Within Rising Channel Thomas Anderson recently shared his analysis of the ETHUSD H1 chart, observing that Ethereum was trading at $3,851.25 and approaching a key resistance zone between $3,876 and $3,900.

Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst He further noted that the 200-day moving average, represented by the red line on the chart, is offering dynamic support around the $2,900 level. This moving average has played a crucial role in sustaining the uptrend and remains an important level to monitor in case of a retracement. The analyst highlighted that Ethereum is now testing the upper boundary of a larger ascending channel, with the $3,287.74 level acting as a solid support zone in the 4H context. Anderson emphasized that this level has served as a major floor during recent consolidations, indicating that any near-term pullback may stabilize there.

2025-07-28 15:03:07+00:00,10x Research Founder Markus Thielen Reveals the Optimal Entry Level for Bitcoin Bulls! Here Are the Details,"As Bitcoin price continues to hover around $119,000, investors are waiting for the right time to join a new bull rally. However, current levels pose a dilemma for investors: Should they enter now or wait for a better pullback? Is $111,673 the Optimal Entry Level for Bitcoin Bulls? 10x Research founder Markus Thielen offers a clear answer to this question. He argues that Bitcoin''s $111,673 level, which acted as resistance in May and has now become support, could be the entry point offering the best risk-reward ratio for investors. “We would prefer Bitcoin to retest the $111,673 breakout level. This level would offer a better risk/reward ratio,” Thielen said in a note to clients on Monday. The risk-reward ratio helps investors determine whether to enter a position by comparing the potential loss of an investment to the potential gain. A 1:2 ratio is typically targeted; that is, an investor aims for at least 2 units of return for 1 unit of risk. This makes entries near support levels attractive for bullish trades. But what if the expected pullback doesn''t materialize? According to Thielen, a break above $120,000 could signal a market re-entry. Specifically, this level would represent a break of the falling trendline connecting the July 14 and July 23 peaks. “A sustained rally, especially above $120,000, could justify repositioning with the trend. However, stop-losses would need to be kept quite tight in this situation,” Thielen says. At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading sideways around $119,500. The rally, which gained over 1% on Sunday, was fueled by news of the signing of the largest trade agreement in history between the US and the European Union. In light of technical analysis, two levels stand out for investors to watch carefully: $111,673 is the ideal support point for a healthier entry, while $120,000 stands out as a potential breakout level that indicates the trend is gaining strength again. *This is not investment advice.

The feature, dubbed Pay with Crypto and available in the coming weeks, enables shoppers to use crypto wallets like MetaMask and Coinbase at checkout. Payments can be made with digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), XRP (XRP) and stablecoins like USDC and USDT, covering 90% of the total crypto market cap. The merchants receive U.S. dollars, settling the transaction almost instantaneously, a spokesperson said Monday. The company will charge a 0.99% service fee, some 90% less than international credit card processing, PayPal said. ""Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations,"" President and CEO Alex Chriss said in a statement. ""Imagine a shopper in Guatemala buying a special gift from a merchant in Oklahoma City,"" he cited as an example. ""Using PayPal''s open platform, the business can accept crypto for payments, increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4% when held on PayPal."" The rollout extends PayPal’s push into digital assets, which includes its U.S. dollar stablecoin (PYUSD) and recent partnerships to expand stablecoin use globally. Merchants can also earn yield on PYUSD balances held within PayPal accounts.

2025-07-28 15:14:06+00:00,IBIT: A Simple Way To Play Bitcoin,"Summary IBIT is the largest Bitcoin ETF in the market, offering easy access to Bitcoin’s upside amid favorable regulatory changes and market optimism. Bitcoin’s dominance and recent all-time highs, fueled by supportive GENIUS Act legislation, make IBIT a compelling vehicle for cryptocurrency exposure. IBIT’s strong historical performance and low expense ratio add to the appeal of the Bitcoin ETF. Key risks include crypto volatility and potential outflows during risk-off periods, but IBIT remains an excellent low-cost choice for bullish Bitcoin investors. BlackRock''s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) is a publicly-traded Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) ETF, the largest in its category, with a strong historical net asset value record and a low expense ratio, allowing investors to participate in Bitcoin''s recent bull-run. The ETF is a cost-efficient way for investors to get exposure to the world’s largest digital currency which continues to dominate the cryptocurrency market. Recently we have seen favorable stablecoin legislation with the GENIUS Act that resulted in new investor optimism with regards to digital assets, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Bitcoin also reached multiple new all-time highs lately which has put the digital currency back on the map for investors. Data by YCharts Previous rating I did not cover the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in the past, but I have had a very favorable opinion on Bitcoin for a very long period time . In fact, only recently did AI GPU maker Nvidia ( NVDA ) replace my Bitcoin holding as the largest position in my portfolio. I also covered Coinbase Global ( COIN ), a leading U.S.-oriented trading platform for cryptocurrencies, which I continue to rate as a buy, chiefly due to rising institutional adoption. Further, favorable regulation in the form of the GENIUS Act lifted up the price of Bitcoin to new all-time highs lately. Bitcoin continues to dominate the market, GENIUS Act legislation legitimizes the world''s #1 cryptocurrency Currently, the Bitcoin price is hovering around $123,000 and has seen a series of consecutive all-time highs in the last month. Bitcoin is the number one global currency by market capitalization as well as market dominance. The outstanding supply of Bitcoins is currently worth $2.4T and Bitcoin represents approximately 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market. Coin Market Cap Recently, U.S. congress made a concerted effort to make America the capital for crypto investors in the world. This drive has led to the passing of the so-called GENIUS Act , a specific piece of legislation that regulates stablecoin issuers and lays out a regulatory framework for companies that issue them. Stablecoins are key to the cryptocurrency market as they provide investors with an opportunity to exit volatile cryptocurrency positions and park money safely on the sidelines. The GENIUS Act has led to renewed interest in cryptocurrencies and with Bitcoin flirting with new all-time highs, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF could be a vehicle for investors to invest in the world''s biggest cryptocurrency. A key driver for Bitcoin is growing cryptocurrency adoption in both retail and institutional markets. In my last work on Coinbase -- A Directional Bet On Bitcoin -- I highlighted the importance of Bitcoin for trading platforms as a main driver of revenue and income growth. In the first-quarter, Bitcoin represented 27% of Coinbase''s trading volume and 26% of its transaction revenue, highlighting the cryptocurrency''s dominating position in the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act could further accelerate especially institutional interest in Bitcoin, as well as other digital assets, which in turn could boost the cryptocurrency''s dominance in the market. Companies like Strategy ( MSTR ) are also aggressively raising capital to make more Bitcoin purchases which, given the limited supply of Bitcoin, could be a catalyst for the cryptocurrency''s price as well. Coinbase The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest ETF in the crypto universe with investable assets of ~$86.0B which makes it about 3.6X larger than the second-largest Bitcoin ETF, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), and 4.0X larger than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). IBIT owns a total of 738,000 Bitcoins and therefore offers investors a direct way to invest in the growth, not only of Bitcoin, but of the entire cryptocurrency universe. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF also has a very competitive expense ratio of 0.25% annually, compared to 0.25% for the FBTC and 1.5% for the GBTC. Data by YCharts So far, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has done a decent job in growing investors'' investment: A $10,000 investment made at the beginning of 2024 would have grown to about $25,000 today, representing a 2.5X factor increase (~150% gain). Further, with the regulatory environment turning profoundly more pro-crypto with the passing of the GENIUS Act, I believe Bitcoin is in a position to achieve new record hi",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805127-ibit-a-simple-way-to-play-bitcoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|REGULATION,IBIT,BTC,"IBIT: A Simple Way To Play Bitcoin.

Recently we have seen favorable stablecoin legislation with the GENIUS Act that resulted in new investor optimism with regards to digital assets, specifically Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). Bitcoin also reached multiple new all-time highs lately which has put the digital currency back on the map for investors. Data by YCharts Previous rating I did not cover the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF in the past, but I have had a very favorable opinion on Bitcoin for a very long period time . In fact, only recently did AI GPU maker Nvidia ( NVDA ) replace my Bitcoin holding as the largest position in my portfolio. I also covered Coinbase Global ( COIN ), a leading U.S.-oriented trading platform for cryptocurrencies, which I continue to rate as a buy, chiefly due to rising institutional adoption. Further, favorable regulation in the form of the GENIUS Act lifted up the price of Bitcoin to new all-time highs lately. Bitcoin continues to dominate the market, GENIUS Act legislation legitimizes the world''s #1 cryptocurrency Currently, the Bitcoin price is hovering around $123,000 and has seen a series of consecutive all-time highs in the last month. Bitcoin is the number one global currency by market capitalization as well as market dominance. The outstanding supply of Bitcoins is currently worth $2.4T and Bitcoin represents approximately 60% of the entire cryptocurrency market. Coin Market Cap Recently, U.S. congress made a concerted effort to make America the capital for crypto investors in the world. This drive has led to the passing of the so-called GENIUS Act , a specific piece of legislation that regulates stablecoin issuers and lays out a regulatory framework for companies that issue them. Stablecoins are key to the cryptocurrency market as they provide investors with an opportunity to exit volatile cryptocurrency positions and park money safely on the sidelines. The GENIUS Act has led to renewed interest in cryptocurrencies and with Bitcoin flirting with new all-time highs, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF could be a vehicle for investors to invest in the world''s biggest cryptocurrency. A key driver for Bitcoin is growing cryptocurrency adoption in both retail and institutional markets. In my last work on Coinbase -- A Directional Bet On Bitcoin -- I highlighted the importance of Bitcoin for trading platforms as a main driver of revenue and income growth. In the first-quarter, Bitcoin represented 27% of Coinbase''s trading volume and 26% of its transaction revenue, highlighting the cryptocurrency''s dominating position in the cryptocurrency market. The GENIUS Act could further accelerate especially institutional interest in Bitcoin, as well as other digital assets, which in turn could boost the cryptocurrency''s dominance in the market. Companies like Strategy ( MSTR ) are also aggressively raising capital to make more Bitcoin purchases which, given the limited supply of Bitcoin, could be a catalyst for the cryptocurrency''s price as well. Coinbase The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF is the largest ETF in the crypto universe with investable assets of ~$86.0B which makes it about 3.6X larger than the second-largest Bitcoin ETF, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), and 4.0X larger than the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ). IBIT owns a total of 738,000 Bitcoins and therefore offers investors a direct way to invest in the growth, not only of Bitcoin, but of the entire cryptocurrency universe. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF also has a very competitive expense ratio of 0.25% annually, compared to 0.25% for the FBTC and 1.5% for the GBTC. Data by YCharts So far, the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF has done a decent job in growing investors'' investment: A $10,000 investment made at the beginning of 2024 would have grown to about $25,000 today, representing a 2.5X factor increase (~150% gain). Further, with the regulatory environment turning profoundly more pro-crypto with the passing of the GENIUS Act, I believe Bitcoin is in a position to achieve new record hi"

2025-07-28 15:25:10+00:00,Bitcoin: Why Ray Dalio’s Bold 15% Gold & Crypto Allocation Could Safeguard Your Wealth,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin: Why Ray Dalio’s Bold 15% Gold & Crypto Allocation Could Safeguard Your Wealth The financial world often buzzes with insights from legendary investors, and few command as much attention as Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates. When Dalio speaks, the investment community listens. His recent suggestion for investors to allocate a significant portion—at least 15%—of their portfolios to both gold and Bitcoin has sent ripples through traditional and crypto markets alike. This isn’t just a casual tip; it’s a strategic recommendation aimed at safeguarding wealth against a backdrop of escalating macroeconomic risks, particularly the burgeoning global government debt. But why this specific allocation, and what makes Bitcoin , a relatively young asset, stand alongside the age-old safe haven of gold? Understanding Ray Dalio’s Vision for Bitcoin Ray Dalio, a titan in the investment world, is renowned for his pragmatic, data-driven approach to markets. His firm, Bridgewater Associates, manages vast sums and is known for its “all-weather” portfolio strategy, designed to perform well in various economic climates. Initially skeptical, Dalio’s perspective on Bitcoin has evolved. As Decrypt reported, his current stance reflects deep concern over the global economic trajectory, marked by unprecedented government spending, increasing debt, and continuous fiat money printing. Dalio views gold as a timeless store of value, a “barbarous relic” perhaps, but one that has consistently protected wealth through centuries of economic upheaval. His embrace of Bitcoin , however, signals a recognition of its emerging role as “digital gold” – a decentralized, finite asset that exists outside the control of any government or central bank. This makes it an attractive hedge against currency debasement and inflation, similar to gold but with unique digital properties. The 15% allocation is a strategic percentage, providing meaningful protection against systemic risks without overwhelming a diversified portfolio. For Dalio, it’s about creating a balanced defense against a potentially perilous future for traditional currencies and bonds, emphasizing diversification into non-debt-based assets that are less susceptible to governmental fiscal policies. Gold vs. Bitcoin: The Dual Hedge Against Uncertainty When considering portfolio hedges, gold has long been the undisputed champion. But in the digital age, Bitcoin has emerged as a formidable contender, leading many to ask: why not both? Dalio’s recommendation leverages the unique strengths of each asset, creating a powerful dual hedge. Gold’s Enduring Appeal: Historical Store of Value: Gold has preserved wealth for millennia, acting as a reliable safe haven during economic crises and geopolitical turmoil. Inflation Hedge: Its limited supply and intrinsic value make it a traditional shield against the erosion of purchasing power. Tangible Asset: Unlike digital currencies, gold is a physical asset, offering a sense of security and tangibility. The Rise of Bitcoin: Digital Scarcity: With a hard cap of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is even scarcer than gold, making it deflationary by design. Decentralization: Operating on a peer-to-peer network, it’s free from government control, censorship, or seizure. Global Accessibility: Easily transferable across borders, 24/7, with relatively low transaction costs compared to traditional finance. High Growth Potential: As a nascent asset class, it offers significant upside potential as adoption grows. The synergy between gold and Bitcoin is compelling. Gold provides the stability of a time-tested asset, while Bitcoin offers the potential for exponential growth and a hedge against a purely digital future where traditional financial systems might face unprecedented challenges. Together, they offer a comprehensive defense strategy for your portfolio. Comparison: Gold vs. Bitcoin as Portfolio Hedges Feature Gold Bitcoin Supply Limited, but new supply mined continually Absolutely finite (21 million coins) Volatility Relatively low High History as Store of Value Thousands of years Just over a decade Decentralization Market-driven, but physical control can be centralized Fully decentralized blockchain network Portability Difficult for large amounts Easy (digital) Navigating Macroeconomic Headwinds with Strategic Bitcoin Allocation The global economy faces unprecedented challenges. Enormous government debts, fueled by expansive fiscal policies and quantitative easing, risk inflation and currency devaluation. In this environment, traditional investments like cash and bonds can see their real value eroded. This is precisely where Dalio’s advice becomes critical. By allocating a portion of your portfolio to assets like gold and Bitcoin , you are essentially purchasing an “insurance policy” against these systemic risks.

Notably, the crypto market has picked up serious momentum in recent weeks. On July 22, the total market cap hit a record high of $3.94 trillion. Altcoin Season Heating UpAlthough the market briefly dipped to $3.7 trillion between July 23 and 25, bulls quickly stepped in, triggering a rebound that pushed the valuation back to $3.86 trillion. With this pace, the $4 trillion milestone now sits within reach.While Bitcoin played a major part in driving this growth, altcoins have taken on a bigger role lately. Remarkably, Ethereum (ETH) led the charge , and its growing influence has led to growing talk of a full-blown altcoin season. As altcoins continue to gain ground, the Bitcoin dominance has dropped significantly. After peaking at 66% in late June, Bitcoin''s share of the market now sits at 61%, a level last seen in early March. This shows that more traders are rotating their capital into alternative assets.Bitcoin Dominance Could Drop FurtherNotably, market veteran Michaël Van de Poppe recently discussed this change using a 3-day Bitcoin dominance chart. He pointed to a strong bearish divergence, where Bitcoin dominance kept making higher highs from mid-May to late June, but the RSI (Relative Strength Index) printed lower highs. This contrast usually signals weakness in the trend and hints at an incoming reversal. This reversal occurred in late June, leading to the recent drop in Bitcoin dominance. Bitcoin Dominance Drop Allowing for Altcoin Season However, Van de Poppe noted that the Bitcoin dominance could record further declines, allowing altcoins to gain more dominance in the coming days. Nonetheless, he admitted that BTC price might still see brief bursts of strength, which could cause altcoins to pull back temporarily. Despite this, he stressed that the broader trend has already turned. The drop from the 66% dominance peak confirms this change in trend. Van de Poppe''s analysis suggests that altcoins are set to take the lead in the next chapter of this market cycle.Altcoin Market Adds $361B in JulyMeanwhile, the altcoin market cap (the TOTAL2 index) continues to grow. In July alone, the market added a massive $361 billion. Ethereum contributed $160 billion to that figure, showing just how much capital flowed into the network. XRP, the second-largest altcoin by market value, added $56 billion. Solana (SOL) brought in $18.64 billion, and BNB (BNB) jumped by $24.31 billion, as it hit new all-time highs in price.Ethereum now aims to reclaim the $4,000 level. Notably, it came close recently by reaching $3,940 before pulling back slightly to $3,810. XRP also eyes a new all-time high above $4. It currently trades at $3.17, about 26% below that mark.Meanwhile, trader Niels, co-founder of Ted Labs, explained in an analysis today that the altcoin market has just reclaimed an eight-year trendline and turned it into support.

2025-07-28 15:51:27+00:00,PayPal enables US merchants to accept over 100 cryptos,"The US payments giant, PayPal, has rolled out a new payment feature that allows small businesses to accept more than 100 cryptocurrencies. This i ncorporates leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. More unconventional tokens, such as Trump’s meme coin and the novelty coin Fartcoin, will be included, too. A spokesperson confirmed that the option is available to any US merchant using the company’s online payment platform. To attract early adoption, PayPal will charge merchants a promotional transaction fee of 0.99% during the first year, which will rise to 1.5% later. According to the Nilson Report, these rates still undercut the 1.57% average fee paid by US businesses to credit card networks in 2024. “There’s a worldview where you can imagine that the world is moving on chain,” said Frank Keller, PayPal’s executive vice president. “Is that happening overnight? No. Some say it’ll take a long time, others say it’ll happen quickly. I think we will see movement.” PayPal streamlines crypto checkout with wallet integration and instant conversions The payment process will allow customers to connect their existing crypto wallets at checkout. Depending on the wallet, PayPal will facilitate a crypto sale via centralized exchanges like Coinbase or decentralized ones like Uniswap. The proceeds will be converted first into PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD, and then into US dollars for the merchant. CEO Alex Chriss illustrated the platform’s global reach by describing how a shopper in Guatemala could use crypto to buy a gift from a merchant in Oklahoma City, which was made possible through the company’s open platform. This development is the firm’s latest effort to deepen its presence in the digital asset space. The company first enabled crypto trading for US users in 2020, later extending the service to Venmo. PayPal reignites crypto push as market recovers and political support grows During the 2022 “crypto winter,” PayPal scaled back its crypto messaging. However, with the market rebounding and growing political support for digital assets under President Donald Trump’s administration, the firm is ramping up again. The company intends to expand the ability for merchants to accept crypto to larger enterprise customers in the US and globally; however, a spokesperson declined to provide a timeline. According to PayPal, this move taps into a $3 trillion crypto market and provides access to more than 650 million crypto wallet holders worldwide. The platform also facilitates near-instant settlements by converting crypto to PYUSD and then fiat, drastically reducing the time and costs of international bank transfers. PayPal’s platform handles everything from KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks to fraud prevention and chargeback management. This means merchants can accept crypto without having to contend with the risks and complexity of the base blockchain. PYUSD, which rolled out in 2023 and is issued by Paxos , a regulated trust company, also provides another layer of compliance. The stablecoin’s market cap is up nearly 70% to $850 million since the beginning of 2025, according to CoinGecko. PayPal’s new offering puts it ahead of other fintech rivals in the crypto space. Though Block (formerly Square) and Stripe have each integrated crypto payments in some form, PayPal’s end-to-end experience integrating a wallet, exchange routing, a stablecoin, and fiat conversion is arguably the most comprehensive offering. Trump has framed his administration as a hard pivot away from the policies of former President Joe Biden, who took a more aggressive approach to investigating cryptocurrency-linked enterprises.

CEO Alex Chriss illustrated the platform’s global reach by describing how a shopper in Guatemala could use crypto to buy a gift from a merchant in Oklahoma City, which was made possible through the company’s open platform. This development is the firm’s latest effort to deepen its presence in the digital asset space. The company first enabled crypto trading for US users in 2020, later extending the service to Venmo. PayPal reignites crypto push as market recovers and political support grows During the 2022 “crypto winter,” PayPal scaled back its crypto messaging. However, with the market rebounding and growing political support for digital assets under President Donald Trump’s administration, the firm is ramping up again. The company intends to expand the ability for merchants to accept crypto to larger enterprise customers in the US and globally; however, a spokesperson declined to provide a timeline. According to PayPal, this move taps into a $3 trillion crypto market and provides access to more than 650 million crypto wallet holders worldwide. The platform also facilitates near-instant settlements by converting crypto to PYUSD and then fiat, drastically reducing the time and costs of international bank transfers. PayPal’s platform handles everything from KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks to fraud prevention and chargeback management. This means merchants can accept crypto without having to contend with the risks and complexity of the base blockchain. PYUSD, which rolled out in 2023 and is issued by Paxos , a regulated trust company, also provides another layer of compliance. The stablecoin’s market cap is up nearly 70% to $850 million since the beginning of 2025, according to CoinGecko. PayPal’s new offering puts it ahead of other fintech rivals in the crypto space. Though Block (formerly Square) and Stripe have each integrated crypto payments in some form, PayPal’s end-to-end experience integrating a wallet, exchange routing, a stablecoin, and fiat conversion is arguably the most comprehensive offering. Trump has framed his administration as a hard pivot away from the policies of former President Joe Biden, who took a more aggressive approach to investigating cryptocurrency-linked enterprises.

Bitcoin has gained strong recognition, not just in the crypto and financial sectors. The digital asset has pivoted to the political landscape as prominent figures in the sector continue to endorse BTC and its decentralized nature. US President Trump Praises Bitcoin Publicly In a notable development that could reshape the political narrative around digital assets, United States President Donald Trump has publicly praised Bitcoin, calling it amazing. The US President made the statement and expressed his confidence in the flagship asset in a recent speech at the White House . Trending Bitcoin posted a short clip of the speech on the social media platform X, which has triggered robust optimism within the crypto community. Trump was once known for being skeptical of cryptocurrencies, but his current endorsement represents a significant shift that suggests a broader acceptance of crypto at the highest levels of government. During the speech, the US President made reference to his skepticism about Bitcoin before pivoting to being a big believer in the asset. After gaining notable knowledge about the crypto king, Trump now considers BTC an amazing asset . According to the president, Bitcoin has become amazing due to the many jobs that have been created with the asset over time. He also drew attention to the huge wave of payments being carried out with BTC in recent times, especially in the US. With significant payments being carried out with Bitcoin , many in the community claim it is taking away massive pressure on the United States dollar. Trump, offering his insights on the development, declares that the asset is “a great thing “for the US. As a result, the president reiterated his confidence in investing in the crypto king, adding that his family is a strong believer in Bitcoin. As the president, Trump stated that he has built an industry with crypto that is important to the US, and possibly to the world. “If we don’t have it, China would,” the president added.

He emphasizes that once the index breaches 75, history shows altcoins like XRP tend to peak, followed by significant corrections.

2025-07-28 16:04:13+00:00,From 232% to 13%: What Happened to Bitcoin’s Short-Term Gains?,"Bitcoin has been trading above $118K, down just over 3% from its recently established all-time high. Despite this, its short-term holders are now seeing just 13% in unrealized profits, according to on-chain data. This group, which is defined as wallets holding BTC between one and three months, often reflects broader sentiment among spot market participants aiming to optimize returns. Capitulation Incoming? In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant explained that while Bitcoin continues to trade near its record highs, these holders are far less profitable than in past cycles. At previous tops in 2012 and 2021, this cohort enjoyed average profits of 232% and 150%, respectively. On the other hand, their gains in the current cycle peaked at 69% and have since dropped sharply. With an average realized price around $104,000, many of these traders bought in near the cycle’s top. Their limited cushion makes them sensitive to market volatility, though current conditions do not yet suggest mass selling. However, should losses deepen, there’s a risk of capitulation from these short-term holders – an event that could pressure the market further. CryptoQuant explained that historically, such shakeouts have often hinted at local bottoms, drawing in strategic buyers looking to capitalize on temporary weakness. Meanwhile, institutional analysts anticipate a potential pause in the crypto asset’s rally. Tactical Pause for Bitcoin Matrixport stated that the setup for this week suggests that momentum may stall as traders confront a wave of market-moving events – including peak US earnings season, a White House report on digital assets, and the Federal Reserve’s rate decision. While sentiment has shifted to near-universal bullishness, history urges caution. August and September have consistently ranked among Bitcoin’s weakest-performing months. August, for one, has delivered an average return close to zero and positive returns in only three of the past ten years. Because of these factors, some traders might start selling, which could cause Bitcoin to dip or move sideways for now. Although the broader outlook remains positive heading into year-end, this week could mark a tactical pause before Bitcoin resumes its longer-term uptrend.

2025-07-28 16:10:06+00:00,Metaplanet Deepens Bitcoin Strategy with Fresh $92.5M Bet,"Metaplanet, a Tokyo-based company listed on the stock exchange, has made another big move in the crypto space. On July 28, the company announced that it had purchased 780 more Bitcoin (BTC) worth a whopping $92.5 million. This purchase shows the company’s strong confidence in the future of Bitcoin. Metaplanet Ranks Among Top Bitcoin Holders with $2B Crypto Reserve According to the announcement, the latest purchase was made at an average price of $118,622 per Bitcoin. This brings Metaplanet’s total crypto holdings to 17,132 BTC. At current market prices, those holdings are worth around $2 billion. In a recent X post , Simon Gerovich, Metaplanet’s CEO, shared that the company’s average purchase price for all its Bitcoins is $101,030. This means the company has managed to accumulate a large number of the top coins at a relatively favorable price. According to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net, Metaplanet now ranks as the seventh-largest public corporate holder of Bitcoin globally. This places it among major players, such as Michael Saylor’s company, which also holds large amounts of Bitcoin on its balance sheet. Tokyo Tech Firm Aims for 210K Bitcoin by 2027 Metaplanet, listed on CoinShares Block Index , is not slowing down. Since it began buying the flagship cryptocurrency in April 2024, the company has made it clear that it views Bitcoin as a key part of its financial future. Last month, the Japanese company announced a new goal to hold over 210,000 Bitcoins by the end of 2027. This would give the company control of 1% of the total Bitcoin supply. Furthermore, Metaplanet’s crypto strategy is already having a positive effect on its business. In the second quarter of this year, the company reported revenue of nearly 1.1 billion yen, equivalent to approximately $7.6 million. That is a 42.4% increase compared to the same period last year. These results were shared in the company’s latest quarterly report, released earlier this month. Metaplanet Stock Climbs as Bitcoin Strategy Draws Investor Attention Investors have taken notice of Metaplanet’s Bitcoin strategy . On the same day of its latest purchase, Metaplanet’s stock rose 5.6% to 1,247 yen, equivalent to $8.40 by midday trading in Japan. The stock has fallen by 16.3% in the last month, but according to Yahoo Finance data, it is still up 258.3% since the start of the year. This indicates that it is performing very well overall, despite the recent drop. Likewise, Bitcoin’s price is also seeing upward momentum in the crypto market, despite recent volatility. As of the time of writing, the top coin is trading at $118,643, up 0.32% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.

2025-07-28 16:10:11+00:00,OKX’s Pioneering Launch: Regulated Crypto Derivatives UAE Now Accessible to Retail Investors,"BitcoinWorld OKX’s Pioneering Launch: Regulated Crypto Derivatives UAE Now Accessible to Retail Investors The world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is rapidly cementing its position as a global hub for digital assets. A groundbreaking development has just reshaped this landscape: OKX, one of the world’s leading crypto exchanges, has made history by launching regulated crypto derivatives UAE for retail investors. This move marks a significant milestone, not just for OKX but for the entire digital asset ecosystem, signaling a new era of regulated and accessible financial products in a burgeoning market. Decoding Crypto Derivatives in the UAE: What’s the Buzz? For many, the term ‘derivatives’ might sound complex, but at its core, it refers to financial contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset – in this case, cryptocurrencies. OKX’s announcement brings three key types of crypto derivatives UAE to retail investors: Futures Contracts: An agreement to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a future date. This allows traders to speculate on the future price movement of an asset without owning the underlying crypto itself. Perpetual Contracts: Similar to futures, but without an expiry date. They are designed to track the spot price of the underlying asset through a funding rate mechanism, making them popular for continuous speculation. Options Contracts: Give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) a cryptocurrency at a specific price (strike price) before or on a certain date. This offers flexibility and can be used for hedging or speculation with limited risk compared to futures. The ability to trade these products with up to 5x leverage, as reported by CoinDesk, means investors can amplify their potential returns, though it also significantly increases risk. This development is particularly notable because it opens up sophisticated trading strategies to a wider audience under a regulated framework. Why is the UAE Becoming a Hub for Crypto Derivatives? The UAE has been proactive in embracing blockchain technology and digital assets, positioning itself as a forward-thinking nation in the global financial landscape. Several factors contribute to its appeal as a crypto hub: Progressive Regulation: Unlike many jurisdictions that have adopted a cautious or even prohibitive stance, the UAE has worked diligently to establish clear regulatory frameworks. The Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai, for instance, has been instrumental in creating a licensing regime that fosters innovation while ensuring investor protection. Economic Diversification: The UAE is actively diversifying its economy beyond oil, with technology, finance, and tourism playing increasingly vital roles. Digital assets align perfectly with this vision, attracting foreign investment and skilled talent. Strategic Location: Situated at the crossroads of East and West, the UAE serves as a bridge between major financial markets, making it an attractive base for global exchanges looking to expand their reach. Government Support: High-level government initiatives and a clear national strategy for blockchain adoption provide a supportive environment for crypto businesses to thrive. OKX’s move is a testament to the success of these efforts, validating the UAE’s commitment to becoming a leading global virtual asset center. OKX’s Strategic Leap: What Products are Available for Crypto Derivatives UAE? OKX’s entry into the regulated crypto derivatives UAE market is a culmination of significant efforts to comply with VARA’s stringent requirements. As the first global exchange to achieve this for retail users, OKX is setting a precedent. Their offerings include: Bitcoin (BTC) Futures, Perpetuals, and Options: Providing exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Ethereum (ETH) Futures, Perpetuals, and Options: Allowing traders to speculate on the second-largest cryptocurrency. Other Major Altcoin Derivatives: While the initial focus is on BTC and ETH, the framework allows for the potential expansion to other major cryptocurrencies as the market matures and regulatory approvals are secured. The 5x leverage offered allows retail investors to control a larger position with a relatively smaller amount of capital. This feature, while appealing for its potential for magnified gains, necessitates a thorough understanding of the associated risks. OKX’s adherence to regulatory standards means these products are offered within a framework designed to protect investors, including robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) procedures, and clear risk disclosures.

As of July 28, blockchain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence confirmed that the firm holds 17,132 Bitcoins , worth approximately $2.021 billion. Arkham @arkham · Follow METAPLANET’S HOLDINGS HIT $2 BILLION OF BITCOIN TODAYMetaplanet’s BTC holdings hit $2B this morning after $46.7M flowed into their wallets from QCP Capital.Metaplanet is the largest Japanese corporate holder of Bitcoin – and they haven’t stopped buying Bitcoin. 7:44 PM · Jul 28, 2025 271 Reply Copy link Read 28 replies This marks a sharp rise from the 12,345 BTC recorded on June 25, when Metaplanet overtook Tesla in corporate Bitcoin reserves. The rapid accumulation reflects Japan’s rising institutional appetite for digital assets, even as Metaplanet’s stock continues to struggle in equity markets. $92 million purchase adds 780 BTC to reserves Metaplanet’s most recent acquisition was linked to a $46.7 million Bitcoin transfer by QCP Capital, a key investor in the firm. Blockchain data shows this transaction was routed directly into Metaplanet’s wallet, likely forming part of a larger $92 million purchase that added 780 BTC to its balance sheet. The information was corroborated by official filings and Arkham Intelligence’s tracking tools. The sharp increase in holdings within a single month underscores the company’s aggressive accumulation strategy, which closely mirrors that of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally. Bitcoin-backed corporate strategies face equity downturn While Metaplanet’s Bitcoin portfolio is growing rapidly, its share price has moved in the opposite direction. The company’s stock is down 25% over the past 30 days and has dropped over 40% from its yearly high. This disconnect is particularly striking given Bitcoin’s current performance near all-time highs. The downturn in Metaplanet’s stock reflects a broader pattern also seen in Strategy, which has similarly lost 25% from its own peak despite holding substantial BTC assets. Both firms employ similar financial models—raising funds via debt and equity to purchase Bitcoin. This model amplifies both potential gains and losses, effectively turning company shares into a leveraged play on Bitcoin. If Bitcoin’s price were to decline significantly, Metaplanet could face liquidity pressures and may be forced to sell portions of its holdings to meet debt obligations. This introduces considerable risk for shareholders, particularly in bearish market cycles. Rising institutional adoption in Japan The pace at which Metaplanet has scaled its BTC treasury signals growing confidence in cryptocurrency among Japanese corporates. Metaplanet began its Bitcoin accumulation in April 2024 and has since executed a series of escalating purchases. From April to late July, its BTC holdings increased by nearly 40%, bolstered by support from institutional investors like QCP Capital. This trend aligns with a broader shift in Japan’s financial ecosystem, where digital assets are becoming increasingly integrated into corporate reserve strategies. While Metaplanet’s approach carries notable financial risk, it also highlights how firms in Asia are experimenting with Bitcoin as a store of value and inflation hedge, similar to some high-profile companies in the US. As of now, Metaplanet remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder in Japan, and among the top globally. The next few quarters will reveal whether this aggressive strategy pays off—or whether it leads to significant financial strain amid ongoing stock price declines.

2025-07-28 16:25:11+00:00,Spot Bitcoin ETF: SEC Delays Spark Uncertainty for Grayscale and Truth Social,"BitcoinWorld Spot Bitcoin ETF: SEC Delays Spark Uncertainty for Grayscale and Truth Social The cryptocurrency market often operates on a tightrope of innovation and regulation. In the latest development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again captured headlines, extending the review deadlines for two significant exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. This move impacts not only Grayscale’s proposed spot Solana (SOL) ETF but also the highly anticipated Truth Social Spot Bitcoin ETF . For investors and enthusiasts alike, these extensions spark crucial questions about the future trajectory of crypto integration into traditional finance. What’s Happening with the Spot Bitcoin ETF Delays? The recent announcement from the SEC underscores its cautious approach to digital asset products. Specifically, the regulatory body has pushed back its decision-making timeline for two distinct ETF proposals: Grayscale’s Spot Solana ETF: Grayscale, a prominent digital asset manager, is seeking to convert its Solana Trust into a spot ETF. This would allow investors to gain exposure to SOL without directly owning the cryptocurrency. The extension indicates the SEC requires more time to assess the unique market dynamics and regulatory considerations surrounding Solana. Truth Social Spot Bitcoin ETF: Less conventional but equally noteworthy is the proposed Spot Bitcoin ETF linked to Truth Social, the social media platform associated with Donald Trump. This application, through a partnership, aims to provide investors with a new avenue for Bitcoin exposure. The delay here highlights the SEC’s continued scrutiny over Bitcoin-related products, even after approving several others earlier this year. These extensions are not uncommon in the world of ETF approvals. The SEC’s mandate is to protect investors, and this often involves thorough reviews of market manipulation risks, liquidity, and custody arrangements for novel products like cryptocurrency ETFs. While frustrating for applicants and eager investors, these delays are part of a standard, albeit often protracted, regulatory process. Why Do SEC ETF Deadlines Matter for the Crypto Market? The SEC’s decisions on ETF applications hold significant weight for the broader cryptocurrency market. Here’s why these deadlines are so closely watched: Market Sentiment and Price Action: Anticipation of an ETF approval often fuels positive market sentiment, leading to price surges for the underlying asset. Conversely, delays or rejections can trigger sell-offs. The extensions for both the Solana and Spot Bitcoin ETF applications introduce a period of uncertainty, which can lead to volatility. Institutional Adoption: Spot ETFs are crucial gateways for institutional investors. They offer a regulated, familiar investment vehicle that sidesteps the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as managing private keys or dealing with unregulated exchanges. Delays in approving such products can slow down the influx of large-scale capital into the crypto space. Regulatory Clarity: Each SEC decision, whether an approval or a delay, contributes to the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets. It provides insights into the SEC’s concerns and requirements, helping other potential issuers tailor their applications. The consistent scrutiny of crypto ETFs reflects the SEC’s ongoing efforts to establish clear guidelines in a rapidly innovating sector. The history of Bitcoin ETF approvals itself is a testament to the SEC’s meticulous approach. It took years of applications, rejections, and legal battles before the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved in early 2024. This precedent suggests that while eventual approval might be likely for many legitimate applications, the path is rarely straightforward. Navigating the Future of Crypto ETFs : Challenges and Opportunities The road to widespread crypto ETF adoption is paved with both significant challenges and immense opportunities. Understanding these dynamics is key to appreciating the SEC’s deliberative process. Challenges: Regulatory Ambiguity: Despite progress, the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains fragmented. Different agencies have varying jurisdictions, creating a complex environment for digital asset products. Market Volatility and Manipulation Concerns: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies and concerns about potential market manipulation are primary reasons for SEC caution. The agency seeks assurances that ETFs will not expose investors to undue risks. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of underlying digital assets is a paramount concern. ETFs must demonstrate robust security measures to protect investor funds from hacks or theft.

BitcoinWorld Spot Bitcoin ETF: SEC Delays Spark Uncertainty for Grayscale and Truth Social The cryptocurrency market often operates on a tightrope of innovation and regulation. In the latest development, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again captured headlines, extending the review deadlines for two significant exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications. This move impacts not only Grayscale’s proposed spot Solana (SOL) ETF but also the highly anticipated Truth Social Spot Bitcoin ETF . For investors and enthusiasts alike, these extensions spark crucial questions about the future trajectory of crypto integration into traditional finance. What’s Happening with the Spot Bitcoin ETF Delays? The recent announcement from the SEC underscores its cautious approach to digital asset products. Specifically, the regulatory body has pushed back its decision-making timeline for two distinct ETF proposals: Grayscale’s Spot Solana ETF: Grayscale, a prominent digital asset manager, is seeking to convert its Solana Trust into a spot ETF. This would allow investors to gain exposure to SOL without directly owning the cryptocurrency. The extension indicates the SEC requires more time to assess the unique market dynamics and regulatory considerations surrounding Solana. Truth Social Spot Bitcoin ETF: Less conventional but equally noteworthy is the proposed Spot Bitcoin ETF linked to Truth Social, the social media platform associated with Donald Trump. This application, through a partnership, aims to provide investors with a new avenue for Bitcoin exposure. The delay here highlights the SEC’s continued scrutiny over Bitcoin-related products, even after approving several others earlier this year. These extensions are not uncommon in the world of ETF approvals. The SEC’s mandate is to protect investors, and this often involves thorough reviews of market manipulation risks, liquidity, and custody arrangements for novel products like cryptocurrency ETFs. While frustrating for applicants and eager investors, these delays are part of a standard, albeit often protracted, regulatory process. Why Do SEC ETF Deadlines Matter for the Crypto Market? The SEC’s decisions on ETF applications hold significant weight for the broader cryptocurrency market. Here’s why these deadlines are so closely watched: Market Sentiment and Price Action: Anticipation of an ETF approval often fuels positive market sentiment, leading to price surges for the underlying asset. Conversely, delays or rejections can trigger sell-offs. The extensions for both the Solana and Spot Bitcoin ETF applications introduce a period of uncertainty, which can lead to volatility. Institutional Adoption: Spot ETFs are crucial gateways for institutional investors. They offer a regulated, familiar investment vehicle that sidesteps the complexities of direct crypto ownership, such as managing private keys or dealing with unregulated exchanges. Delays in approving such products can slow down the influx of large-scale capital into the crypto space. Regulatory Clarity: Each SEC decision, whether an approval or a delay, contributes to the evolving regulatory landscape for digital assets. It provides insights into the SEC’s concerns and requirements, helping other potential issuers tailor their applications. The consistent scrutiny of crypto ETFs reflects the SEC’s ongoing efforts to establish clear guidelines in a rapidly innovating sector. The history of Bitcoin ETF approvals itself is a testament to the SEC’s meticulous approach. It took years of applications, rejections, and legal battles before the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved in early 2024. This precedent suggests that while eventual approval might be likely for many legitimate applications, the path is rarely straightforward. Navigating the Future of Crypto ETFs : Challenges and Opportunities The road to widespread crypto ETF adoption is paved with both significant challenges and immense opportunities. Understanding these dynamics is key to appreciating the SEC’s deliberative process. Challenges: Regulatory Ambiguity: Despite progress, the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains fragmented. Different agencies have varying jurisdictions, creating a complex environment for digital asset products. Market Volatility and Manipulation Concerns: The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies and concerns about potential market manipulation are primary reasons for SEC caution. The agency seeks assurances that ETFs will not expose investors to undue risks. Custody and Security: Ensuring the secure custody of underlying digital assets is a paramount concern. ETFs must demonstrate robust security measures to protect investor funds from hacks or theft. Opportunities: Mainstream Accessibility: ETFs democratize access to cryptocurrencies, allowing everyday investors to participate through traditional brokerage accounts without needing to navigate crypto exchanges.

2025-07-28 16:27:32+00:00,"Wall Street now holds the chips on Bitcoin trading, hedging and pricing","Bitcoin isn’t being driven by crypto-native traders anymore. The ones calling the shots now wear suits, not hoodies. What started off on offshore platforms is now being controlled by institutional traders on regulated US soil. Wall Street has taken over. And the bros are using traditional tools to model it, hedge it, and set its price like they would for any other asset. According to Bloomberg, a huge chunk of this control comes from BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust, or IBIT . With $86 billion in assets under management, IBIT is now the largest Bitcoin ETF in the world. But see, the real story isn’t actually the fund itself. It’s the options market that’s grown around it, one that’s now so active that traders are pressuring regulators to lift trading limits. IBIT’s open interest in options has more than tripled this year to $34 billion, and daily trading volume now averages $4 billion. That beats most credit and emerging markets ETFs. Only the biggest equity, gold, and small-cap ETFs trade more actively. IBIT changes how Bitcoin’s risk is priced and traded Rocky Fishman, founder of Asym 500, said, “It’s highly unusual for an ETF to develop an option market of this magnitude ever, let alone eight months after launch.” IBIT’s rapid growth has made it the main venue for risk pricing in the US Bitcoin ETF market. Regulatory filings show that institutional holders of IBIT nearly doubled since December. IBIT also sees more options trading than any other Bitcoin ETF , even though it holds just a little over half the assets across the group. This isn’t about speculation anymore, folks, this is risk management. Kevin de Patoul, CEO of market maker Keyrock, said institutional players stayed away from crypto options for years because they were only available offshore. Now that the market has onshore options and spot ETFs, institutions have the access they need to use familiar strategies. “Now, with spot ETFs and US-listed options, institutions finally have an access point that fits their playbook,” Kevin said . Traders are also behaving differently. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, explained that the shrinking difference between call and put prices on IBIT options, even when Bitcoin isn’t rallying, means more investors are using puts to hedge against losses. This flow has a natural dampening effect on volatility and prevents panic selling. This new behavior is also showing up in when and where Bitcoin is being traded. US hours are now responsible for 57.3% of Bitcoin-dollar trades, up from 41.4% in 2021. And nearly half of spot Bitcoin trading volume flows through the twelve US-listed ETFs, based on FalconX Research. Offshore trading lags behind as regulators stall IBIT’s next move Deribit , the dominant offshore exchange for derivatives, is still in the picture, but IBIT is closing in fast. For now, the two function as isolated markets. Le Shi, managing director at Auros, says the lack of a unified collateral system and limited capital mobility make it hard to run large trades across both venues. “There’s no unified collateral system yet,” he said. “But stablecoins could eventually help bridge the gap.” Coinbase, however, is already making moves. In May, it acquired Deribit for $2.9 billion. Luuk Strijers, Deribit’s chief executive, confirmed that the firms are working on linking their platforms. He said the effort could eventually allow shared collateral, common risk frameworks, and cross-platform exposure netting, which would make bigger trades more practical and reduce friction between markets. But there’s a catch. IBIT’s rapid rise has hit a regulatory wall. The current position cap on IBIT options is 25,000 contracts, a restriction meant to control risk. But it’s limiting how much asset managers can deploy systematic strategies. A report from Cboe Global Markets said the cap keeps risk exposure well below what’s possible with other ETFs like MBTX and CBTX. In January, Nasdaq asked the SEC to raise the cap tenfold. The agency has until September to respond. Robbie Mitchnick, head of digital assets at BlackRock, said, “We’ll likely see a non-trivial increase in option volumes from current levels once those constraints are lifted.” Even with the cap in place, Wall Street hasn’t slowed down. Bitcoin is now treated like any other asset it was meant to squash. “Eventually, all assets will be digital,” Kevin said. “And what we now call crypto will just be another part of the financial system; priced, hedged, and risk-managed like everything else.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

2025-07-28 16:30:07+00:00,"The Days Of Parabolic Bitcoin Bull Runs Are Over: Analyst Reveals How BTC Will Reach $1,000,000","A crypto analyst has issued a bold new forecast on the future trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC), claiming that the era of parabolic bull runs and painful bear markets is over. In its place, he envisions a slower, more institutionally driven path toward long-term growth. Looking ahead, the analyst believes that Bitcoin could reach $1,000,000 in the next decade. Bitcoin Road To $1,000,000 Will Be Slow In an X social media post, Mitchell Askew, a crypto market expert and the Head of Research at Blockware, shared his long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, predicting that the flagship cryptocurrency is set to hit $1,000,000 within the next 10 years. However, he noted that this massive price surge won’t come from explosive bull runs previously seen in 2013 or 2017. Related Reading: The Final Bitcoin Act: Here’s What To Expect As BTC Trends Sideways According to the analyst, Bitcoin has moved past the age of parabolic price surges followed by crushing drawdowns. Rather than repeating past cycles of 10,000% gains in a year trailed by a 75% crash, the flagship cryptocurrency is now exhibiting a much more controlled and less dramatic growth pattern. He believes that the cryptocurrency’s rise to $1,000,000 could unfold through a cycle of pumps followed by prolonged consolidations, making it a slow climb. This gradual growth style will likely discourage short-term speculators and casual investors, allowing only those with long-term conviction to benefit. Askew’s bold BTC forecast and speculations about a slower growth trajectory are rooted in his belief that the cryptocurrency’s price action has fundamentally changed following the launch of Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The introduction of this investment product in early 2024 marked a turning point for BTC, transforming it into a more stable and institutionalized asset class. Notably, since the approval of the Bitcoin ETF, the analyst asserts that the most significant drawdown the cryptocurrency has faced is about 30%—a stark contrast to the extreme volatility of the past. While Bitcoin remains volatile by traditional standards, the nature of its price swings has considerably shifted, pointing to broader stabilization in the market. In this environment, private miners, particularly those affiliated with BlockwareTeam, are expected to benefit the most. By continuously mining at a lower cost and taking advantage of tax incentives like a 100% bonus depreciation on hardware, they stand to profit steadily as Bitcoin climbs higher. Askew believes that this evolution is not overly optimistic or bearish, but rather a logical progression as BTC matures into a mainstream financial asset with increasing institutional involvement. Analyst Warns Against Unrealistic Short-Term Gains In his analysis, Askew noted that the expectation that Bitcoin could surge to $500,000 in just five months, or that identifying a precise cycle top will lead to easy profits, is now considered unrealistic.

2025-07-28 16:45:10+00:00,Bitcoin Transfer: Mysterious $900 Million Move Sparks Market Speculation,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transfer: Mysterious $900 Million Move Sparks Market Speculation In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, certain events can send ripples through the entire market, capturing the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. One such event recently unfolded, triggering a wave of speculation: a colossal Bitcoin transfer . According to Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service, an astonishing 7,625 BTC, valued at approximately $900 million at the time of the transaction, was moved from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an entirely new, unknown wallet address. This significant movement raises numerous questions about its purpose, potential impact, and the broader implications for the crypto ecosystem. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Signify? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, especially from a major exchange to an unidentified wallet, it’s rarely a random occurrence. Such a substantial Bitcoin transfer could indicate several things, each with different potential ramifications for the market: Institutional Movement: It could represent a large institutional investor or a fund making a strategic move. Institutions often prefer holding their assets in cold storage for enhanced security, rather than on an exchange. Whale Accumulation: A wealthy individual, often referred to as a ‘whale’ in crypto circles due to their vast holdings, might be accumulating more Bitcoin or consolidating their holdings. Exchange Rebalancing: While less common for such a large sum to go to a completely ‘new’ unknown wallet, exchanges sometimes move funds for internal rebalancing, security upgrades, or to transfer assets to cold storage. However, the ‘unknown new wallet’ aspect points away from typical internal movements. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: Large transactions often happen off-exchange through OTC desks to avoid impacting market prices. The movement from Coinbase could be the final step of such a deal, with the buyer moving their newly acquired BTC to a private wallet. Understanding the potential reasons behind such a significant Bitcoin transfer is crucial for market participants attempting to gauge future market sentiment and price action. Who Are These Crypto Whales, and Why Do They Move Such Large Sums? The term ‘whale’ in the cryptocurrency space refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. These are often early adopters, large institutional investors, or even cryptocurrency founders themselves. Their movements, like this recent Bitcoin transfer , are closely watched because they can signal shifts in market sentiment or impending price volatility. Why do they move such large sums? The motivations are diverse: Security: The primary reason for moving funds off an exchange is often enhanced security. While exchanges employ robust security measures, holding assets in a self-custodied wallet (especially a hardware wallet or cold storage) gives the owner complete control and reduces exposure to exchange hacks or regulatory risks. Long-Term Holding (HODLing): Many whales are long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s future appreciation. Moving funds to a private wallet signals an intention to hold for an extended period, rather than actively trading. Privacy: While blockchain transactions are transparent, the ownership of a specific wallet address can remain pseudonymous. Moving funds to a new, unknown wallet adds another layer of privacy for the owner. Strategic Deployment: The funds might be moved in preparation for a new investment, a venture capital deployment, or even to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, although this is less common for such a large, single Bitcoin transfer to an unknown address.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transfer: Mysterious $900 Million Move Sparks Market Speculation In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, certain events can send ripples through the entire market, capturing the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts alike. One such event recently unfolded, triggering a wave of speculation: a colossal Bitcoin transfer . According to Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service, an astonishing 7,625 BTC, valued at approximately $900 million at the time of the transaction, was moved from Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, to an entirely new, unknown wallet address. This significant movement raises numerous questions about its purpose, potential impact, and the broader implications for the crypto ecosystem. What Does This Massive Bitcoin Transfer Signify? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, especially from a major exchange to an unidentified wallet, it’s rarely a random occurrence. Such a substantial Bitcoin transfer could indicate several things, each with different potential ramifications for the market: Institutional Movement: It could represent a large institutional investor or a fund making a strategic move. Institutions often prefer holding their assets in cold storage for enhanced security, rather than on an exchange. Whale Accumulation: A wealthy individual, often referred to as a ‘whale’ in crypto circles due to their vast holdings, might be accumulating more Bitcoin or consolidating their holdings. Exchange Rebalancing: While less common for such a large sum to go to a completely ‘new’ unknown wallet, exchanges sometimes move funds for internal rebalancing, security upgrades, or to transfer assets to cold storage. However, the ‘unknown new wallet’ aspect points away from typical internal movements. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: Large transactions often happen off-exchange through OTC desks to avoid impacting market prices. The movement from Coinbase could be the final step of such a deal, with the buyer moving their newly acquired BTC to a private wallet. Understanding the potential reasons behind such a significant Bitcoin transfer is crucial for market participants attempting to gauge future market sentiment and price action. Who Are These Crypto Whales, and Why Do They Move Such Large Sums? The term ‘whale’ in the cryptocurrency space refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of a particular cryptocurrency, enough to potentially influence market prices with their trades. These are often early adopters, large institutional investors, or even cryptocurrency founders themselves. Their movements, like this recent Bitcoin transfer , are closely watched because they can signal shifts in market sentiment or impending price volatility. Why do they move such large sums? The motivations are diverse: Security: The primary reason for moving funds off an exchange is often enhanced security. While exchanges employ robust security measures, holding assets in a self-custodied wallet (especially a hardware wallet or cold storage) gives the owner complete control and reduces exposure to exchange hacks or regulatory risks. Long-Term Holding (HODLing): Many whales are long-term investors who believe in Bitcoin’s future appreciation. Moving funds to a private wallet signals an intention to hold for an extended period, rather than actively trading. Privacy: While blockchain transactions are transparent, the ownership of a specific wallet address can remain pseudonymous. Moving funds to a new, unknown wallet adds another layer of privacy for the owner. Strategic Deployment: The funds might be moved in preparation for a new investment, a venture capital deployment, or even to participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, although this is less common for such a large, single Bitcoin transfer to an unknown address. Regardless of the specific reason, the sheer volume of this Bitcoin transfer underscores the presence of significant players in the market whose actions warrant attention. Is Your Crypto Safe?

In a new interview on Bloomberg, Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income, says that the US government’s fiscal situation requires it to issue “a lot” more debt. Rieder says large debt issuance makes it harder to allow longer-term yields to go up, making it more difficult to invest in T-Bills with durations longer than 10 years. And if inflation picks up, Rieder says long bonds could get hit even harder along with equities. “We’re going to issue a lot of debt. The long end is a hard place to invest. It used to be that the long end protected you against the equity market. If inflation ends up being higher, which I don’t necessarily anticipate, then what’ll happen is equities and the long end will get hit. So the long end of the yield curve today, given that you can get so much yield – if you’re an investor on the front end – the long end doesn’t become that attractive.” Looking forward, Rieder says that the US can only maintain its debt burden if it somehow manages to spur a higher GDP than the amount of debt it takes on, perhaps with the productivity expected to come from the growth of artificial intelligence (AI). “There’s only one way to de-lever the economy. You’ve got to outrun the debt, you’ve got to outgrow it. So there is a plausible outcome where you get nominal GDP running at 4.5-5% if you get that interest rate down to 3%. Gosh, now you can start to de-lever but it takes a really long period of time. Listen, I think the one engine today, since we are going to have a bigger debt burden, and not only are we going to have a bigger debt burden, you have to fund it domestically, because internationalism doesn’t buy as much.

In the early hours of July 28, Japan’s Metaplanet expanded its Bitcoin position by acquiring an additional 780 BTC for approximately $92.5 million , bringing its total holdings to 17,132 BTC valued at roughly $1.73 billion. Research compiled by Hodl15Capital indicates that over 35 additional companies are actively preparing to raise billions of dollars to implement Bitcoin accumulation strategies. Consistent with earlier Cryptonews projections , there’s mounting optimism within the cryptocurrency community that Bitcoin could potentially deliver 100% returns, effectively doubling from current price levels before this supercycle concludes. Bitcoin Price Prediction: $124K Target Emerges From Charts From a technical perspective, the BTC/USDT daily chart displays a clear pattern of sustained bullish momentum followed by consolidation phases. Following a decisive breakout above the ascending channel, Bitcoin has entered a trading range between approximately $116,000 and $123,000. This price action has created a rectangular consolidation pattern just below the current all-time high of $123,218. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently hovers around 61.63, with the RSI moving average at 64.65. This suggests that bullish momentum remains present but is not overextended. Given the structure, Bitcoin appears to be forming a bullish continuation pattern. If the support at $116,000 continues to hold and price breaks out above the $119,000 resistance zone, a push toward the projected target of $124,005 or higher is likely. A failure to hold the support zone, however, could lead to a retest of the ascending trendline around the $110,000 level. Why Smart Money Targets This $5.4M Bitcoin Hyper L2 Gem Since Bitcoin’s price is staying strong, many people are keeping their Bitcoin while also looking for new crypto projects that could make them potentially more money. One project getting lots of attention is Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) . Bitcoin Hyper takes the power of Bitcoin and upgrades it for the modern crypto world.

2025-07-28 17:00:50+00:00,"Crypto price today: Bitcoin consolidates after weekend rally, altcoins shed gains as ETH fails to break $4k","After staging a strong rally over the weekend, fuelled by renewed enthusiasm around the EU–US trade deal, Bitcoin cooled off on Monday and consolidated below $119,000, as momentum remained skewed towards Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. The total market capitalisation of the crypto sector briefly reclaimed the $4 trillion mark before slipping to $3.9 trillion at press time, weighed down by losses across both Bitcoin and altcoins. Despite the dip, market sentiment climbed to a monthly high of 75, moving deeper into greed territory and rising two points from the previous day. This indicates that investor appetite for risk remains strong. Overall, the current drawdown appears to reflect a healthy consolidation following the brief rally, likely driven by subtle profit-taking among short-term traders and growing caution ahead of the upcoming FOMC meeting. By late Asian trading hours on Monday, most top altcoins had surrendered their weekly gains, with only a handful holding on to modest single-digit profits. Why is Bitcoin stuck? Bitcoin bulls attempted to reclaim $119,000 multiple times today before retreating towards the $118k support band. A sharp wave of liquidations triggered the correction, largely concentrated around $119,000, which pressured the price lower. According to derivatives data, Bitcoin saw more than $55.6 million in total liquidations in the last 24 hours, of which over $41.5 million came from long positions. Generally, this means that a large number of traders had bet on further upside but were caught offside as the price stalled below resistance. The 24-hour BTC liquidation heatmap further illustrates this pressure point. A dense band of liquidation activity was visible between $118,800 and $119,800, signaling a heavy concentration of leveraged long positions. Bitcoin 24-hour liquidation heatmap. Source: CoinGlass. When Bitcoin failed to sustain a breakout above this zone, a chain reaction of automatic sell orders was triggered as long positions were forcefully closed by exchanges due to margin calls. The impact of this was amplified by elevated speculative activity. Derivatives volume surged over 100% to reach $71.38 billion in the past 24 hours, while open interest rose to $85.67 billion, showing that traders were aggressively entering new positions. As the price declined, it entered another liquidation-heavy zone around $117,800 to $118,200, also highlighted on the heatmap. This area has since acted as a temporary support, helping to stabilize the price in late trading hours. Beyond technical dynamics, broader macro uncertainty also played a role in dampening sentiment. Traders entered Monday’s session with increased caution ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, set to conclude on Wednesday. Equity and crypto markets remain alert to any signals on the Fed’s interest rate path. While market participants expect no change at this meeting, commentary on possible rate cuts later in 2025, if dovish, could fuel another leg higher; in contrast, a neutral or hawkish tone would likely restrain risk appetite. For the rally to continue, traders will be watching for a clear break above $119,800, the upper edge of the high-risk liquidation zone. This level has acted as a key resistance, and reclaiming it would signal renewed strength and reduce the risk of further long-side liquidations. Some market analysts have also flagged this level as a key area to watch. See below.

2025-07-28 17:01:09+00:00,Why is Ethereum (ETH) Soaring? Bernstein Analysts Warn About One Thing,"Finance company Bernstein, which also publishes analyses on cryptocurrencies, stated that the main factors behind Ethereum’s value increase of over 55% in the last 30 days are spot ETF inflows and new “Ethereum treasury” companies that add ETH to their company balance sheets. In a note published today, the firm assessed how these new institutional buyers could impact Ethereum''s supply, return rates, and risk dynamics across the network. By Bernstein''s estimate, leading companies like SharpLink Gaming, BitMine Immersion, Bit Digital, and BTCS purchased approximately 876,000 ETH in July. These companies hold 0.9% of the total supply of Ethereum in their reserves thanks to capital raised through public markets and private investors. Bernstein describes this trend as the application of Strategy''s Bitcoin treasury model to Ethereum, while noting an additional element on the Ethereum side: staking. Recalling that Strategy has established a long-term, low-leverage portfolio of 607,770 BTC, Bernstein notes that Ethereum treasury companies aim to achieve operational returns by combining this capital structure with staking agreements. Related News: Explosive Volume Surge Recorded in 14 Altcoins on South Korean Exchanges - Here''s the List Today, staking yields hover just below 3% and have historically ranged between 3% and 5%. According to Bernstein, these rates suggest that a $1 billion Ethereum treasury could generate annual returns of between $30 million and $50 million. This revenue model fundamentally differs from Bitcoin treasury strategies because, while Bitcoin''s revenue flows to network miners, Ethereum''s revenue flows directly to coin holders. However, this introduces new liquidity decisions and risks. Strategy, for example, maintains a 15–20% debt-to-portfolio ratio and holds 5–6 times its debt in liquid assets while keeping its assets fully liquid. In contrast, Ethereum treasuries must consider complex factors such as staking exit sequences, retaking, DeFi smart contract risks, and asset-liability balances. Bernstein cautions that staking transactions typically have high liquidity, but exit queues can take several days. The search for additional returns, particularly on restaking platforms like Eigenlayer, carries significant risks. Companies that adopt prudent balance sheet management combined with institutional-grade custody solutions are more likely to achieve greater scale. The firm also acknowledges that Bitcoin treasury models offer a good foundation for institutionalization, but argues that success or failure on the Ethereum side will depend entirely on risk management capabilities. Bernstein also cites the reasons why some companies are considering Ethereum as a strategic treasury asset, citing stablecoin expansion and the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). Many players, including major platforms like Coinbase and Robinhood, are migrating these transactions to Ethereum and its layer-2 networks. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-28 17:05:24+00:00,Pundit: Things Will Change for XRP Overnight. This Rally Is Just the Beginning,"In a recent post on X, crypto commentator Bale delivered a strong message to XRP holders: “What people don’t realise about XRP is that overnight things will change. We pumped over 60% in one week. This is just the beginning.” His words come at a time when XRP is witnessing a major breakout that many analysts believe could mark the start of a long-awaited bull run. XRP’s Explosive Breakout Over the past few weeks, XRP surged from around $2.20 to nearly $3.65 , registering more than 60% growth, one of its strongest moves in recent years. This spike wasn’t just a momentary jump; it came with high volume and was supported by a broad shift in market sentiment. XRP’s technical charts indicate a breakout from a multi-month consolidation range, a pattern that typically precedes sustained upward momentum. This breakout marks a significant change in the asset’s trend structure, with XRP now forming higher highs and higher lows, a classic sign of a new bullish phase. What people don’t realise about XRP is that overnight things will change. We pumped over 60% in one week. This is just the beginning. — BALE (@AltcoinBale) July 28, 2025 Bullish Technical Setups Analysts have identified several bullish patterns, with a recent golden cross on the 50-day and 200-day moving averages confirming the strength of the upward trend. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also identified a rare “compound fulcrum” pattern, projecting a potential target of $4.47, while other projections range as high as $6 if momentum continues. Currently, XRP trades comfortably above key support around $3.10–$3.15, a zone it recently reclaimed after months of resistance. As long as the price holds above this level, technical analysts agree that further upside remains likely. Fuel Behind the Rally This rally isn’t just about charts. A convergence of macro and market dynamics is fueling the move. XRP is benefiting from renewed altcoin interest as Bitcoin consolidates near all-time highs. This has led to a shift in capital toward large-cap altcoins like XRP and Ethereum. Adding to the momentum, institutional participation has increased sharply. Derivatives open interest in XRP is now above $10 billion, reflecting a sharp uptick in confidence from whales and professional traders. Meanwhile, recent U.S. legislation aimed at providing regulatory clarity for cryptocurrencies has helped boost investor sentiment across the board. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Overnight Change May Be Closer Than Expected Bale’s point, that things can shift overnight, is especially relevant in the crypto landscape. Sentiment, liquidity, and price action can change drastically in hours, especially when assets like XRP break major resistance levels. While many traders remain cautious, XRP’s recent move suggests it may be entering an accelerated phase, where rapid gains occur with little warning. If the current structure holds, XRP could soon retest the $4 mark. A break above that may open the path to $5–$6, especially if broader altcoin strength continues and Bitcoin maintains its dominance. The Beginning of a New Era? XRP’s recent breakout, supported by strong technicals, institutional interest , and favorable market conditions, suggests that the current rally may be far from over. Bale’s assertion that “things will change overnight” captures the nature of XRP’s market cycle, a sudden, powerful move that leaves most behind. For now, all eyes remain on XRP’s next levels. If momentum persists, this may well be remembered as the beginning of the rally that redefined XRP’s role in the crypto market.

2025-07-28 18:00:27+00:00,Bitcoin Demand Builds at $117K: Cost Basis Distribution Defines Key Support Level,"Bitcoin continues to consolidate between $115,000 and $120,000, with bulls maintaining control despite the lack of a breakout above $123,000. What stands out in this range-bound structure is the clear demand concentration around $117,000. According to Glassnode’s BTC Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap, this level has consistently attracted buying interest, acting as a key area where capital rotates into Bitcoin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Endures One Of The Most Intense Bear Weeks Of This Bull Cycle – Details The heatmap reveals dense clusters of cost basis activity near key price levels. This reinforces its role as short-term support and a psychological anchor for bulls. As long as this zone holds, the risk of a full breakdown remains limited—even as BTC struggles to reach new highs. However, repeated rejections near $120K and muted momentum raise concerns that upside exhaustion could eventually lead to deeper downside. If demand at $117K begins to fade, price may quickly revisit lower levels in search of fresh support. For now, though, on-chain data shows that accumulation remains healthy, and this zone could be the foundation for Bitcoin’s next attempt to reclaim the highs. $117K Becomes Bitcoin’s Accumulation Stronghold as Market Shifts Bitcoin’s $117,000 level has emerged as a key accumulation zone, with approximately 73,000 BTC now held at this cost basis, according to the latest data from Glassnode. This reinforces the idea that buyers continue to step in on every dip, absorbing selling pressure and stabilizing price action within the current range. The BTC Cost Basis Distribution Heatmap shows a consistent buildup of demand in this area, highlighting investor confidence around this support zone. What makes this cycle particularly unique is the presence of legal clarity and accelerating institutional adoption in the US. Unlike previous cycles, where price action was often driven by retail speculation and extreme volatility, today’s structure appears more measured. Regulatory progress—especially around spot Bitcoin ETFs and clearer custody frameworks—has attracted a wave of long-term capital. This influx of institutional demand is not only stabilizing the market but also making it less reactive to short-term swings. However, Bitcoin’s calm price action may not last much longer. As Ethereum gains momentum, driven by rising open interest and on-chain activity, capital is beginning to rotate into altcoins. Historically, such transitions have marked the end of Bitcoin-led phases and the beginning of broader market expansions. If ETH and altcoins continue to accelerate, Bitcoin’s tight trading range could break—either leading to a catch-up rally or a temporary pause as capital rotates elsewhere.

BTC Range Narrows As Price Holds Between Key Levels The 8-hour chart shows Bitcoin consolidating tightly between $115,724 and $122,077, with the price currently hovering around $118,762. Despite a lack of strong momentum, the structure remains bullish as BTC holds above all major moving averages—the 50 SMA ($118,185), 100 SMA ($113,521), and 200 SMA ($109,754). This alignment signals continued trend strength, with short-term dips being supported by buyers. Volume has declined during the consolidation, a typical sign of a neutral phase where market participants await a breakout. Notably, each pullback toward the lower boundary near $115,700 has been met with strong demand, confirming this zone as key support. Meanwhile, resistance at $122,000 continues to cap bullish attempts, forming a clear range that will likely define Bitcoin’s next move.

Offering more payment options comes with a number of benefits for merchants, they note. Some of these are attracting more customers, supporting global expansion, enhancing efficiency, speed, lowering fees, and earning rewards for PYUSD on PayPal.

This is a promotional fee for the first year, and it will increase to 1.5%, according to Fortune Crypto , citing Frank Keller, an executive vice president. The report notes that this is lower than the 1.57% average rate that U.S. businesses paid to credit card companies in 2024. Meanwhile, the executive explained that users will be able to connect their existing wallets to a checkout page to complete a transaction. The crypto will go into a centralized or decentralized exchange , depending on the wallet, where PayPal will sell it, convert it into PYUSD, and then into USD, which the merchant will ultimately receive. And the company seems to plan further expansion. Per the report: “PayPal plans to expand the ability for merchants to accept crypto to larger enterprise customers in the U.S. and globally, but a spokesperson declined to provide a timeline.” Per PayPal’s latest announcement, businesses globally lose billions every year in cross-border fees. “Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations,” said Alex Chriss, President and CEO at PayPal. “Using PayPal’s open platform, the business can accept crypto for payments, increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4% when held on PayPal,” he says.

This is a promotional fee for the first year, and it will increase to 1.5%, according to Fortune Crypto , citing Frank Keller, an executive vice president. The report notes that this is lower than the 1.57% average rate that U.S. businesses paid to credit card companies in 2024. Meanwhile, the executive explained that users will be able to connect their existing wallets to a checkout page to complete a transaction. The crypto will go into a centralized or decentralized exchange , depending on the wallet, where PayPal will sell it, convert it into PYUSD, and then into USD, which the merchant will ultimately receive. And the company seems to plan further expansion. Per the report: “PayPal plans to expand the ability for merchants to accept crypto to larger enterprise customers in the U.S. and globally, but a spokesperson declined to provide a timeline.” Per PayPal’s latest announcement, businesses globally lose billions every year in cross-border fees. “Businesses of all sizes face incredible pressure when growing globally, from increased costs for accepting international payments to complex integrations,” said Alex Chriss, President and CEO at PayPal. “Using PayPal’s open platform, the business can accept crypto for payments, increase their profit margins, pay lower transaction fees, get near instant access to proceeds, and grow funds stored as PYUSD at 4% when held on PayPal,” he says.

2025-07-28 18:10:12+00:00,Plasma Blockchain: A Monumental $373M Triumph in XPL Token Sale,"BitcoinWorld Plasma Blockchain: A Monumental $373M Triumph in XPL Token Sale In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, significant funding rounds often signal groundbreaking innovation and future potential. Recently, the Plasma blockchain made headlines by securing an astonishing $373 million in its XPL token sale, an achievement that far surpassed its initial targets and sent ripples of excitement across the digital asset landscape. This monumental raise, backed by a major player like Bitfinex, positions Plasma as a project to watch closely, especially with its ambitious goal of enabling fee-free USDT transfers. Understanding the Plasma Blockchain Phenomenon So, what exactly is the Plasma blockchain , and why has it attracted such substantial investment? At its core, Plasma is envisioned as a stablecoin-focused Layer-1 blockchain. For those new to the terminology: Layer-1 Blockchain: This refers to the foundational blockchain network itself, like Bitcoin or Ethereum. It’s the base layer where transactions are processed and secured without relying on another network. Stablecoin-Focused: This means Plasma’s primary utility and design are geared towards facilitating the efficient and stable transfer of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar (e.g., USDT). The backing by Bitfinex, a prominent cryptocurrency exchange, adds a significant layer of credibility and institutional support, signaling confidence in Plasma’s underlying technology and its long-term vision. This isn’t just another project; it’s a venture with substantial industry endorsement. The Unprecedented XPL Token Sale: A Deep Dive The public sale of Plasma’s native token, XPL, was nothing short of extraordinary. Over a mere 10-day period, the sale managed to raise an astounding $373 million, massively oversubscribing its initial $50 million target. This indicates a tremendous demand and belief from the community and investors alike. Key Figures from the XPL Token Sale: Total Raised: $373 million Initial Target: $50 million (exceeded by over 7x) Network Valuation Post-Sale: $500 million Percentage of Total Supply Sold: 10% of XPL’s total supply Participating Wallets: Approximately 3,000 wallets The fact that 10% of the total XPL supply was distributed among around 3,000 wallets suggests a broad distribution, which is often seen as a positive sign for decentralization and community engagement. This successful funding round not only provides Plasma with significant capital for development but also validates its market appeal and potential impact. How Does Plasma Aim for Fee-Free USDT Transfers? Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the Plasma blockchain is its innovative approach to transaction fees, particularly for stablecoins like USDT. The project aims to enable fee-free USDT transfers by merging two distinct yet powerful blockchain models: Bitcoin’s UTXO Model (Unspent Transaction Output): This model, fundamental to Bitcoin, tracks transactions based on unspent outputs from previous transactions. It’s known for its simplicity, security, and efficiency in handling value transfers. Ethereum’s EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine): The EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts on Ethereum. It’s renowned for its flexibility, programmability, and ability to support complex decentralized applications (dApps). By integrating these two models, Plasma seeks to combine Bitcoin’s robust transaction handling with Ethereum’s smart contract capabilities. The ambition here is to create a highly efficient and scalable environment where stablecoin transactions can occur without incurring the gas fees typically associated with transfers on networks like Ethereum. This could be a game-changer for daily stablecoin use, making micro-transactions and frequent transfers far more economically viable for users globally. What are the Potential Benefits of Plasma’s Innovation? The implications of Plasma’s proposed fee-free model are vast, particularly for the broader adoption of stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi): Enhanced Accessibility: Lowering or eliminating transaction fees makes stablecoins more accessible and practical for everyday use, especially in regions where even small fees can be a significant barrier. Increased Utility: Businesses and individuals could use stablecoins for a wider range of activities, from peer-to-peer payments to remittances, without worrying about accumulating transaction costs. DeFi Efficiency: While Plasma is stablecoin-focused, a more efficient stablecoin ecosystem can indirectly benefit DeFi protocols that rely heavily on stablecoin liquidity and transfers. Scalability: The merger of UTXO and EVM models could potentially offer a highly scalable infrastructure, capable of handling a large volume of transactions quickly and efficiently.

2025-07-28 18:13:35+00:00,"Bitcoin Eyes $130K: Breakout, Trade Deal, and M2 Growth Signal Next Leg Up","Bitcoin (BTC) may be gearing up for its next parabolic move, possibly toward $130,000, if an analyst is correctly reading a multi-pronged surge in technical, macroeconomic, and geopolitical signals. According to pseudonymous trader Doctor Profit, after months of struggling beneath a critical long-term resistance, the flagship cryptocurrency has finally broken above a trendline dating back to the 2021 all-time high, confirming a bullish breakout that he argues the market has yet to fully price in. Bullish Breakout and Trade Deal Fuel Market Optimism In a detailed X post on July 28, Doctor Profit highlighted Bitcoin’s decisive monthly breakout above its multi-year diagonal resistance. The said level rejected bulls four months in a row, between November 2024 and February 2025. July’s clean break and retest on the monthly chart signal the beginning of what he calls “the next leg up,” setting the stage for an advance toward $130,000. Adding fuel to the rally is the recent trade deal between the United States and the European Union announced by President Donald Trump and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on July 27. The agreement includes $750 billion in U.S. energy exports and $600 billion in EU investments into U.S. infrastructure, measures expected to lift U.S. stock markets and, by extension, crypto assets like BTC. “This is very bullish for the mid and long term as there is no longer fear due to a tariff war between countries, especially and most importantly between the US and Europe.” The announcement had an immediate impact, with Bitcoin rising from $114,500 to over $119,000, while BNB soared to a new all-time high above $850. Doctor Profit also noted the quietly increasing M2 money supply, reinforcing the sense of macro bullishness. According to him, despite the Federal Reserve’s ongoing “quantitative tightening,” M2 has expanded by 2.3% year-to-date, with May and June seeing the most aggressive monthly increase at +0.63%. Historically, every 1% increase in M2 has roughly corresponded to a 30% to 35% rise in BTC. The analyst suggested that if the correlation holds, Bitcoin could rally another 15% to17.5%, which would land it squarely in the $130,000 zone. Price Analysis and Broader Market Trends At the time of this writing, BTC was trading at $119,389, marking a modest 0.9% gain in the last 24 hours and 0.7% over the week. The asset’s performance is more solid across longer time frames, gaining 11.3% in 30 days and 75.6% across the past year. However, its short-term moves lag behind Ethereum (ETH) and select altcoins. Nevertheless, the OG crypto’s fundamental drivers remain intact. ETF inflows continue to absorb more BTC than is being mined, particularly from issuers like BlackRock, acting as long-term vacuum cleaners. And with the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC decision due this Wednesday, where a rate hold is almost certain, Doctor Profit believes the stage is set for continued liquidity expansion.

2025-07-28 18:24:00+00:00,Strategy Pauses Bitcoin Buys Amid $2.5B STRC Equity Offering,"Strategy Misses Bitcoin Purchases Despite Price Volatility Michael Saylor’s Strategy, the largest public holder of Bitcoin, made no purchases of BTC last week, even though the cryptocurrency continued to be volatile. According to a U.S. SEC filing published Monday, Strategy’s holdings were unchanged at 607,770 BTC. As Bitcoin increased from around $118,000 to over $119,000 during the week, Strategy’s market absence coincided with an early investor selling 80,000 BTC, based on CoinGecko data. It is the second instance this month that Strategy’s Bitcoin purchasing has stopped, as no buys were also recorded during the first week of July. July Bitcoin Buys Took a Sudden Decline Strategy purchased a total of 10,445 BTC in July, split into two buys 4,225 BTC on July 14 and 6,220 BTC on July 21. That figure is a 39% decrease from June’s 17,075 BTC haul. The deceleration is even more pronounced when compared to previous months: 26,695 BTC in May and 25,370 BTC in April. Coincidentally, Strategy also missed a buy during the first week of April, following the same pattern as July. STRC Offering Raised to $2.5 Billion Strategy’s muted Bitcoin activity in the last week was concurrent with the company expanding the size of its latest equity program. The firm raised its Series A perpetual stretch preferred stock (STRC) offering to $2.521 billion on Friday – significantly higher than the initial $500 million announcement.

Co-founder Michael Saylor described STRC as one of four pillars of Strategy’s “Bitcoin defense department,” noting its strategic role in long-term BTC acquisition.

2025-07-28 18:24:56+00:00,Why FDIG Will Continue To Lag Behind Crypto And Single Stock Picks,"Summary Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF remains inefficient, underperforming both its main holdings and direct investments in BTC, due to structural index constraints. The FDIG fund’s design caps upside by limiting exposure to outperforming stocks like Coinbase, forcing rebalancing into weaker holdings. I don''t see a role for FDIG for people wanting broad crypto exposure - this is not a space where such strategy can generate good returns. Especially not with FDIG. I maintain a Hold rating for existing investors, but do not recommend new entries; better risk/reward exists elsewhere in the crypto space. Roughly one year ago, I covered the Fidelity Crypto Industry and Digital Payments ETF ( FDIG ), arguing how it is the “best among the worst” crypto proxies ETFs. At the time I recommended a Hold, as I saw little value in holding this fund over a selection of cryptocurrencies and/or crypto companies. So far, I was proven right. The FDIG ETF lagged behind most crypto and proxies. It lagged behind MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), which back then I called out as a more interesting leveraged crypto bet, as well as Coinbase Global, Inc ( COIN ), its main holding. FDIG, past 1 year performance (Seeking Alpha) FDIG only performed better than the broader market (represented by a S&P 500 ETF (SPY) in the chart), but it lagged behind a simple exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). Today, I revise FDIG to assess whether its relative underperformance is set to continue or there can be a case to invest in this fund to gain broad exposure to the cryptocurrency sector. FDIG: quick ETF profile In my previous coverage of FDIG, I analyzed this ETF and outlined why I believe it is not an efficient ETF. I am not going to repeat the whole analysis (which readers can find there ). I will, however, report again the logic the index underlying FDIG follows to select its holdings, as it is relevant for my updated analysis: It selects Crypto Industry stocks that derive at least 50% of their revenue from cryptocurrency and related blockchain technology activities. These companies will collectively make up at least 60% of the index''s weight. It then selects the top 20 Digital Payments stocks, which must also derive at least 50% of their revenue from digital payments processing activities, based on average daily trading volume. Stocks are weighted according to their daily trading volume, adhering to diversification rules, and capped at the lesser of 22.5% of the index weight or the maximum weight that can support a $20M flow. When it comes to its expense ratio, FDIG charges a 0.40% yearly fee , which is 0.01% higher than what the fund charged one year ago, at the time of my last coverage. Compensating this increase in fees is a marginal improvement in FDIG’s Bid/Ask Spread , which went down from 0.88% one year ago to a lower, but still hefty, 0.78% today. Overall, FDIG remains an inefficient fund, in my view. The reason why I still cannot recommend it, however, goes well beyond its fees and liquidity metrics. It has to do with the way its underlying index is designed - something I will cover next. To understand the problem with FDIG, look at its top holdings FDIG’s top holdings are roughly unchanged since the time of my last coverage. Coinbase is the largest position held by the fund, followed by MARA Holdings, Inc ( MARA ) and other Bitcoin miners. FDIG Top hildings, August 2024 (Seeking Alpha) FDIG Top hildings, July 2025 (Seeking Alpha) The main difference regards concentration. While FDIG was already fairly concentrated one year ago, with its top 10 holdings representing more than half the fund, it is even more concentrated today. Its top 10 holdings represent more than 70% of the fund. This is not because of a strategic choice (or change in strategy) of the fund. Rather, it is a function of the overperformance of its main holding, Coinbase. Indeed, the number one holding of FDIG at the time of writing is the Fidelity Securities Lending Cash Central Fund - which is effectively a cash equivalent. That position in itself, at almost 24% of the fund, explains why the ETF’s concentration went up so significantly in just one year. I think the reason the fund is holding so much cash is because it has to rebalance itself after Coinbase’s overperformance of the past few months. While FDIG is not equally weighted per se, it has a cap for each stock, which can be at most 22.5% of the index weight or the maximum weight that can support a $20 Million flow. Additionally, “Digital Payments Stocks,” the category where Coinbase falls, can only weigh a total of 40% of the index. Given Coinbase performed so well in the last year, FDIG is now forced by design to reinvest its returns into different stocks. This is also the main weakness of FDIG, in my opinion: by limiting the run of its winners by design, the fund ends up being exposed to less performing companies .

2025-07-28 18:25:11+00:00,US-China Trade Relations: Unveiling the Pivotal Impact on Global Markets,"BitcoinWorld US-China Trade Relations: Unveiling the Pivotal Impact on Global Markets In the intricate dance of global diplomacy, even a seemingly simple announcement can carry significant weight. Recently, Walter Bloomberg on X reported that U.S.-China trade discussions held in Stockholm concluded for the day, citing a source familiar with the talks. While this might sound like a routine procedural update, it’s a tiny thread in the vast, complex tapestry of US-China Trade Relations – a relationship that profoundly influences not just geopolitical landscapes but also the volatile world of cryptocurrency. For crypto enthusiasts and investors, understanding the nuances of these high-stakes interactions is absolutely crucial. Let’s delve deeper into why these ongoing discussions matter and what their ripple effects mean for your digital assets. The Daily Rhythm of US-China Trade Relations : A Snapshot from Stockholm The news from Stockholm, indicating the conclusion of a day’s worth of talks, highlights the persistent, often behind-the-scenes, nature of diplomatic engagement between the world’s two largest economies. These are not one-off events but part of a continuous dialogue aimed at navigating a myriad of complex issues. When we talk about US-China Trade Relations , we’re referring to an evolving dynamic that encompasses much more than just tariffs. It includes discussions on intellectual property rights, technology transfer, market access, industrial subsidies, and even broader geopolitical concerns. The fact that these discussions are ongoing, even if just concluding for the day, signifies a commitment to dialogue, however slow or contentious it may be. Each meeting, each statement, and even each silence, contributes to the overall narrative of this pivotal relationship. Why Do US-China Trade Relations Matter So Much? The economic interdependence between the United States and China is immense. Together, they represent a significant portion of global GDP, trade, and consumption. Their bilateral trade volume alone runs into hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This deep integration means that any shift in their relationship sends tremors across the globe. Here are some key reasons why their interactions are so impactful: Global Supply Chains: Both nations are integral to global supply chains, from manufacturing electronics to producing pharmaceuticals. Disruptions or reconfigurations due to trade policies can lead to shortages, price hikes, and manufacturing shifts worldwide. Economic Growth: The health of both the U.S. and Chinese economies directly affects global economic growth. Trade disputes can dampen consumer and business confidence, leading to reduced investment and slower growth. Technological Supremacy: A significant part of the current tension revolves around technological leadership, particularly in areas like AI, 5G, semiconductors, and quantum computing. Policies restricting tech transfers or market access have profound implications for global innovation and competition. Financial Markets: Major policy announcements or escalations in US-China Trade Relations can trigger significant volatility in global stock markets, bond yields, and currency exchange rates. Geopolitical Influence: Beyond economics, their relationship is a cornerstone of global geopolitics, influencing everything from climate change initiatives to regional conflicts. Navigating the Ripple Effect: How US-China Trade Relations Influence Global Markets The immediate impact of developments in US-China Trade Relations is often felt in traditional financial markets. Positive news, such as a breakthrough in talks, can lead to a surge in investor confidence, boosting equities and sometimes strengthening riskier assets. Conversely, an escalation of tensions, like new tariffs or sanctions, can trigger a “risk-off” sentiment, causing investors to flee equities and seek safety in assets like the U.S. dollar or government bonds. Consider the following: Stock Market Volatility: Major indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Hang Seng are highly sensitive to trade news. Companies with significant exposure to either market can see their valuations fluctuate wildly. Currency Fluctuations: The U.S. dollar and the Chinese Yuan (CNY) are directly impacted. A stronger Yuan might be seen as a sign of trade progress, while a weaker Yuan could signal economic challenges or be used as a strategic tool. Commodity Prices: Demand for raw materials like oil, industrial metals, and agricultural products can be influenced by the economic outlook tied to trade relations. For instance, a slowdown in Chinese manufacturing due to trade friction could depress demand for oil. This interconnectedness means that even seemingly minor updates from Stockholm can contribute to a larger narrative that dictates the ebb and flow of global capital.

2025-07-28 18:25:31+00:00,Crypto Market Outlook: Key Economic Signals That Could Move Bitcoin and Altcoins This Week,"As Bitcoin edges closer to the much-anticipated $120,000 milestone, all eyes turn to a critical week filled with macroeconomic signals from the United States. These developments spanning labor market data, consumer sentiment, and central bank policy have the potential to either sustain the current bullish momentum or derail it. The economic calendar is packed with triggers that could jolt the crypto markets. Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of what to watch and why it matters. Consumer Confidence and Labor Market Reports The week kicks off with the Consumer Confidence Index, a key barometer of public sentiment, due Tuesday. In June, the index fell sharply to 93.0, down from May’s 98.0, as consumers grew wary of rising inflation and the renewed tariff agenda under President Trump. July forecasts call for a modest rebound to 96.0. Should the number come in stronger, it could fuel investor optimism and drive capital into speculative assets like Bitcoin . But another disappointment may push risk-averse behavior favoring safer instruments and dragging crypto performance down. The strength of the U.S. labor market continues to steer the Fed’s policy direction. This week brings a trilogy of reports that could add volatility to crypto markets: JOLTS (Tuesday) – Job openings projected to fall to 7.4M from 7.8M. A bigger-than-expected drop could signal economic cooling, sparking hopes of rate cuts. ADP Employment (Wednesday) – With last month’s surprise contraction (-33K jobs), a softer print this week could reinforce a dovish Fed outlook. Initial Jobless Claims (Thursday) – A rise to 221K may reflect job market fragility, boosting Bitcoin as an inflation hedge. Non-Farm Payrolls (Friday) – Forecasted job growth slowdown to 102K, with unemployment ticking up to 4.2%. This could validate rate-cut speculation and buoy crypto prices. FOMC Interest Rate Decision: The Market’s Pivot Point The FOMC’s interest rate decision on Wednesday will be pivotal. While a rate hold is almost fully priced in (with a 96.9% probability), traders will scrutinize the Fed’s tone. A dovish narrative could invigorate the market, pushing Bitcoin higher, while hawkish language may curb the current uptrend. Given inflation remains at 2.7%, the Fed faces a balancing act: contain price growth without triggering a sharp slowdown. Any tilt in their messaging will ripple through crypto markets almost immediately. Trump’s Trade Policies: The Hidden Variable President Trump’s tariff campaigns continue to sow uncertainty, further complicating the macro outlook. For many investors, such instability reinforces Bitcoin’s value proposition as a non-sovereign, borderless hedge. However, any sign of policy stabilization may see speculative capital retreat to more traditional assets, limiting crypto’s upside.

Senators Raise Red Flags Over Crypto Mortgage Lending According to the July 25 letter , U.S. lawmakers Jeff Merkley, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Chris Van Hollen, and Mazie Hirono claim the move “could introduce unnecessary risks to consumers and pose serious safety and soundness concerns for the U.S. housing and financial markets.” “To the extent that historical volatility and liquidity persists even as the market matures, a borrower using crypto faces an increased risk that they may not be able to exit a crypto position and convert to cash at a price that would allow them to buffer against risk of mortgage default,” the senators state. “Crypto is also subject to heightened risks of loss due to scams, cyber hacks, or physical theft, which could leave homeowners vulnerable to losing their crypto assets with little hope of recovery,” they added. New FHFA Crypto Order Receives Both Praise and Scrutiny The letter comes shortly after Pulte’s June 25 order directing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare a proposal that would consider “cryptocurrency as an asset for reserves in their respective single-family mortgage loan risk assessments” without first being converted to U.S. dollars.

2025-07-28 18:30:12+00:00,MicroStrategy Bitcoin: Unlocking Astounding Acquisition Potential Without Dilution,"BitcoinWorld MicroStrategy Bitcoin: Unlocking Astounding Acquisition Potential Without Dilution In the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, one company has consistently stood out for its strategic embrace of Bitcoin: MicroStrategy. Once a software firm, it has transformed into a leading corporate holder of Bitcoin, captivating investors and analysts alike. Recently, American investment bank TD Cowen offered a fascinating analysis, suggesting that MicroStrategy’s unique approach could enable it to acquire an astonishing 17,000 additional Bitcoin without diluting its common equity. This isn’t just a headline-grabbing figure; it’s a testament to a sophisticated financial strategy that could redefine how institutional capital flows into the digital asset space. Let’s dive deep into how MicroStrategy Bitcoin acquisition strategy is making waves and what it means for the future of crypto investment. What Did TD Cowen’s Analysis Reveal About MicroStrategy Bitcoin Holdings? TD Cowen, a reputable American investment bank, recently highlighted Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) with an insightful analysis. Their report detailed how Strategy, through a strategic issuance of 28 million shares of variable-rate preferred stock, successfully raised $2.47 billion. This capital was specifically earmarked for continuous Bitcoin accumulation. According to TD Cowen’s analysts, if Strategy deploys all these proceeds towards purchasing Bitcoin, assuming an average unit price of $120,000, the company would secure an impressive additional 20,500 BTC. This projection underscores MicroStrategy’s ambition and capacity. The bank’s perspective, as reported by The Block, frames Strategy as a crucial “conduit for institutional capital to flow into Bitcoin.” By offering diverse Bitcoin-based securities, MicroStrategy has effectively created a pathway for larger entities to gain exposure to Bitcoin, bypassing some direct ownership complexities. Key takeaways from TD Cowen’s initial assessment: Significant Capital Raise: $2.47 billion secured via 28 million shares of variable-rate preferred stock. Projected Bitcoin Acquisition: An estimated 20,500 BTC if all proceeds are used at an average price of $120,000. Strategic Role: Positioned as a vital channel for institutional investors seeking Bitcoin exposure. How Does MicroStrategy Achieve an Unmatched Cost of Capital Advantage? TD Cowen asserts that “no one will be able to match Strategy’s cost of capital advantage.” This speaks to a meticulously crafted financial architecture allowing MicroStrategy to acquire Bitcoin more efficiently. MicroStrategy’s advantage stems from its innovative use of convertible notes and preferred stock offerings. Unlike typical corporations, MicroStrategy explicitly raises capital to acquire Bitcoin. This clarity of purpose, combined with the structure of its offerings, attracts specific investors: those wanting Bitcoin exposure but preferring a regulated, equity-like vehicle. The variable-rate preferred stock allows MicroStrategy to raise significant capital without immediately diluting common shareholders. For investors, it offers a yield while providing indirect exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements through MicroStrategy’s substantial holdings. By issuing instruments like convertible notes or preferred stock at competitive rates—lower than potential Bitcoin appreciation or direct acquisition costs for institutions—MicroStrategy creates a powerful arbitrage opportunity. They borrow at one rate to buy an asset expected to appreciate at a higher rate, doing so in a way palatable to large institutional investors. This unique positioning as a “Bitcoin proxy” allows them to tap into vast institutional capital, solidifying their cost of capital advantage in the MicroStrategy Bitcoin acquisition narrative. Can MicroStrategy Really Acquire 17,000 BTC Without Diluting Common Stock? This is perhaps the most intriguing claim from TD Cowen’s analysis. The bank asserts that even if MicroStrategy needs to issue common stock to cover cash dividends related to its variable-rate preferred stock over the next decade, it could still purchase an additional 17,000 BTC without diluting its existing common stock. How? The key lies in the interplay between preferred stock, common stock, and the value derived from underlying Bitcoin holdings: Preferred Stock Dividends: Variable-rate preferred stock has dividend obligations. Companies might issue new common stock to fund these payments. Bitcoin Value Appreciation: MicroStrategy’s core strategy relies on Bitcoin’s long-term appreciation, increasing the company’s overall enterprise value. The Net Effect: TD Cowen’s argument implies that the potential appreciation in MicroStrategy’s existing Bitcoin holdings, combined with strategic capital raises, can more than offset the dilutive effect of issuing common stock for dividend payments.

Recently, a significant development from CryptoQuant contributor J.A. Maartunn, shared on X, has sent ripples through the investor community: the unprecedented Coinbase Bitcoin buying streak has officially concluded. After an astonishing 94 consecutive days of net inflows, marking the longest such streak ever recorded for the exchange, the consistent institutional accumulation appears to have paused. This news immediately sparks a critical question: Is this a definitive signal that the market is poised for a significant course correction, or merely a temporary breather before the bullish momentum for Coinbase Bitcoin returns with renewed vigor? Understanding the implications of this shift is paramount for anyone navigating the dynamic landscape of digital assets. What Exactly Was the Coinbase Bitcoin Buying Streak? To truly grasp the importance of this recent development, we must first understand what the Coinbase Bitcoin buying streak represented. For 94 days, Coinbase, one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges, experienced consistent net inflows of Bitcoin. This means that, day after day, more Bitcoin was being moved onto the exchange’s wallets than was being withdrawn. While retail investors also use Coinbase, these sustained inflows are typically indicative of significant institutional accumulation. These large players, such as hedge funds or corporations, steadily increase their Bitcoin holdings, often through over-the-counter (OTC) desks that then transfer the purchased BTC to their Coinbase accounts for custody or future distribution. The significance of this streak lies in its exceptional duration and consistency. Ninety-four days is not a fleeting trend; it represents over three months of unwavering demand from a segment of the market known for its deep pockets and long-term investment horizons. This consistent buying pressure from institutional entities on Coinbase has historically been a strong bullish signal, often preceding or accompanying significant price rallies for Bitcoin. It suggests a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future value and a strategic positioning for anticipated market growth. Why Does Coinbase Bitcoin Activity Matter So Much to the Market? With numerous exchanges globally, you might wonder why activity on Coinbase holds such particular weight. The answer lies in several key factors that position Coinbase as a crucial indicator for institutional sentiment, especially within the United States market. Institutional Gateway: Coinbase is frequently the preferred on-ramp for large U.S. institutions and corporations seeking exposure to cryptocurrencies. Its regulatory compliance, robust security infrastructure, and professional services make it a trusted partner for entities managing substantial capital. “Coinbase Premium”: Historically, a phenomenon known as the “Coinbase Premium” has been observed. This refers to Bitcoin trading at a slight premium on Coinbase compared to other global exchanges, particularly during periods of strong U.S. institutional demand. Its presence or absence is closely watched by analysts as an indicator of significant buying pressure from a crucial market segment. Influence on Broader Market Sentiment: When U.S. institutions are actively accumulating Coinbase Bitcoin , it often signals confidence in the asset’s trajectory. This confidence can positively influence retail investor sentiment and attract further capital into the market, thereby fueling upward price momentum. On-Chain Transparency: Thanks to the transparent nature of blockchain technology and sophisticated analytics from platforms like CryptoQuant, these movements can be tracked. This insight allows analysts like J.A. Maartunn to identify trends that might otherwise remain hidden, providing a clearer picture of underlying market dynamics. The consistent accumulation on Coinbase over such a prolonged period was a tangible sign of this institutional appetite. Its cessation, therefore, naturally raises questions about whether that appetite is waning or simply taking a strategic pause. Is This a Turning Point for the Bitcoin Market? The end of a record-breaking streak naturally leads to speculation about a market shift. For some analysts, the conclusion of the Coinbase Bitcoin buying spree could be interpreted as a cautionary signal. Here’s why: Profit-Taking: After a period of significant accumulation and subsequent price appreciation, institutions might be realizing profits. This is a normal part of any investment cycle and could lead to increased selling pressure. Capital Reallocation: Large investors constantly re-evaluate their portfolios.

Access to capital markets is becoming a competitive advantage for miners seeking to expand their hashrate and accumulate Bitcoin. Institutional Bitcoin demand, amplified by ETF inflows, is influencing how miners allocate proceeds from large-scale fundraising. MARA Holdings has closed its upsized $950 million offering of 0.00% convertible senior notes due 2032 for Bitcoin and corporate expansion. MARA Completes Upsized $950 Million Offering of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 https://t.co/QzQhbkDRlH — MARA (@MARA) July 28, 2025 According to a press release published on July 28, the transaction was finalized on July 25 and conducted as a private sale under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. $950 Million Raised by MARA Holdings The company reported net proceeds of approximately $940.5 million after discounts and commissions. MARA said it has already used $18.3 million of the funds to repurchase $19.4 million of outstanding 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2026. An additional $36.9 million went toward capped call transactions with initial purchasers and financial institutions. The majority of the remaining proceeds will be allocated to acquiring additional Bitcoin and funding corporate expansion initiatives. MARA said these include working capital support, scaling its infrastructure, pursuing strategic acquisitions, and paying down other obligations. The notes will mature on August 1, 2032, and may be converted into cash, MARA common stock, or a combination of both, at the company’s discretion. They are convertible prior to May 1, 2032, only under certain conditions, and thereafter until two days before maturity. The initial conversion rate is 49.3619 shares per $1,000 principal amount, equivalent to about $20.26 per share, subject to adjustments. The company also retains the right to redeem the notes for cash after January 15, 2030, if its stock trades at least 130% above the conversion price for a specified period. MARA noted that capped call transactions were arranged to mitigate dilution risk upon conversion and offset potential cash payments exceeding the principal amount. The cap price for these transactions was set at $24.14 per share, a 40% premium to MARA’s average stock price on July 23. Financing and Bitcoin Accumulation Many large crypto firms are navigating capital markets to strengthen their balance sheets while accumulating Bitcoin. Convertible debt structures are increasingly favored as they allow firms to raise funds without immediate dilution while positioning for potential equity upside. At the same time, the move underscores how institutional interest in Bitcoin is influencing corporate treasury management. With U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and debt-financed acquisitions fueling demand, miners and infrastructure providers are competing not only on hashrate capacity but also on access to capital, a factor that may determine long-term industry leadership. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What role do interest-free notes play in corporate strategy? Because MARA’s notes carry a 0.00% coupon, the company avoids ongoing interest expenses. That frees more cash for operations and Bitcoin accumulation but shifts the focus to managing eventual conversion or redemption risk. How does the capped call structure protect MARA’s shareholders? The capped call transactions reduce dilution risk if the notes convert to equity, while setting an upper price limit where protection ends. This tool is increasingly used by firms issuing large-scale convertible debt. What risks come with funding expansion through debt in the mining sector? Debt commitments can pressure firms during downturns in Bitcoin’s price or periods of reduced mining profitability, increasing the importance of risk management and operational efficiency.

MARA Completes Upsized $950 Million Offering of 0.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2032 https://t.co/QzQhbkDRlH — MARA (@MARA) July 28, 2025 According to a press release published on July 28, the transaction was finalized on July 25 and conducted as a private sale under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. $950 Million Raised by MARA Holdings The company reported net proceeds of approximately $940.5 million after discounts and commissions. MARA said it has already used $18.3 million of the funds to repurchase $19.4 million of outstanding 1.00% convertible senior notes due 2026. An additional $36.9 million went toward capped call transactions with initial purchasers and financial institutions. The majority of the remaining proceeds will be allocated to acquiring additional Bitcoin and funding corporate expansion initiatives. MARA said these include working capital support, scaling its infrastructure, pursuing strategic acquisitions, and paying down other obligations. The notes will mature on August 1, 2032, and may be converted into cash, MARA common stock, or a combination of both, at the company’s discretion. They are convertible prior to May 1, 2032, only under certain conditions, and thereafter until two days before maturity. The initial conversion rate is 49.3619 shares per $1,000 principal amount, equivalent to about $20.26 per share, subject to adjustments. The company also retains the right to redeem the notes for cash after January 15, 2030, if its stock trades at least 130% above the conversion price for a specified period. MARA noted that capped call transactions were arranged to mitigate dilution risk upon conversion and offset potential cash payments exceeding the principal amount. The cap price for these transactions was set at $24.14 per share, a 40% premium to MARA’s average stock price on July 23. Financing and Bitcoin Accumulation Many large crypto firms are navigating capital markets to strengthen their balance sheets while accumulating Bitcoin. Convertible debt structures are increasingly favored as they allow firms to raise funds without immediate dilution while positioning for potential equity upside. At the same time, the move underscores how institutional interest in Bitcoin is influencing corporate treasury management. With U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs and debt-financed acquisitions fueling demand, miners and infrastructure providers are competing not only on hashrate capacity but also on access to capital, a factor that may determine long-term industry leadership. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What role do interest-free notes play in corporate strategy? Because MARA’s notes carry a 0.00% coupon, the company avoids ongoing interest expenses. That frees more cash for operations and Bitcoin accumulation but shifts the focus to managing eventual conversion or redemption risk. How does the capped call structure protect MARA’s shareholders? The capped call transactions reduce dilution risk if the notes convert to equity, while setting an upper price limit where protection ends. This tool is increasingly used by firms issuing large-scale convertible debt. What risks come with funding expansion through debt in the mining sector? Debt commitments can pressure firms during downturns in Bitcoin’s price or periods of reduced mining profitability, increasing the importance of risk management and operational efficiency.

This isn’t just a slight deviation; it’s a bold leap from pixels to pig iron, signaling a profound belief in the power of technology to revitalize foundational industries. For those accustomed to the rapid cycles of social media and apps, Liss’s conviction in the future of heavy industry, particularly steel, presents a fascinating case study in entrepreneurial vision. What Sparked Daniel Liss’s Unconventional Shift? Liss’s journey into steelmaking began in an unlikely place: writing op-eds for Bitcoin World about anti-trust enforcement in social media. These commentaries caught the attention of individuals in Washington D.C., leading to an invitation for Liss to guest judge a war game capstone exercise in spring 2023 at the National War College. The scenario, highly relevant to current global dynamics, depicted a struggle for supremacy over Taiwan and the South China Sea between the U.S. and China. Liss’s critical takeaway from this high-stakes simulation was stark: “Our core supply chain of the arsenal of democracy — literally, the ships that my grandfather fought in — we don’t have the ship-building capacity. If we did, we don’t have the steel to make it.” This realization ignited an intense interest, even an obsession, with the steel supply chain. This newfound focus was the genesis of Nemo Industries , Liss’s latest venture. Unveiling Nemo Industries : AI’s Foray into Heavy Industry The core proposition for Nemo Industries seems to merge two significant American concerns: steelmaking capacity and artificial intelligence. Operating in stealth until now, Liss offered Bitcoin World a glimpse into his ambitious plans. The immediate goal is clear: Nemo will leverage AI to optimize the production of pig iron. Liss asserts that the steel industry is significantly outdated, with many plants relying on rudimentary tools like Excel spreadsheets or even clipboards for operations. While the people running these facilities possess immense expertise, Liss noted that such knowledge doesn’t scale efficiently. This is where AI steps in, offering the potential to standardize, optimize, and streamline processes that have remained largely unchanged for decades. Pig iron, an intermediate product, is crucial for steelmakers to create various alloys, making its efficient production a bottleneck for the entire industry. The Core of AI Steelmaking : Building for the Future Nemo Industries isn’t merely developing software for existing steel plants; Liss’s conviction runs deeper. The company plans to construct its own furnaces. This strategic decision stems from Liss’s belief that companies integrating AI from their inception will gain a substantial “20% to 30% margin advantage” over competitors. In an industry as capital-intensive as steelmaking, such a conviction demands significant investment. For context, Hyundai Motor Group recently announced a $6 billion steel plant in Louisiana. While Nemo’s plant, focused specifically on pig iron, may not reach that colossal figure, the ambition remains grand. Furthermore, Nemo plans to fire its furnaces using natural gas, which produces less carbon dioxide than coal, a common fuel in the iron and steel sector. The company is also exploring carbon capture technologies, a move made more financially viable by tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, which remain largely intact and make such endeavors profitable for Nemo. Scaling Ambition: How Industrial AI Attracts Big Investments To realize this ambitious vision, Nemo Industries requires substantial backing. Liss has partnered with Michael DuBose, an investor with a strong background in natural gas, having previously worked at Cheniere Energy and built billions of dollars in LNG infrastructure. This experience is vital for a startup aiming for such scale. According to PitchBook, Nemo previously secured $28.2 million in funding. The company is currently in discussions with existing investors to raise a $100 million Series A round. Beyond private investment, Nemo has reportedly received offers for over $1 billion in incentives from two southern states, contingent on the company building three plants over 15 years. This is a monumental undertaking, but Liss believes such ambition is necessary to deliver the returns sought by venture capitalists in the basic industries. He points to historical examples like Rockefeller, Carnegie, Mellon, and Frick, whose investments in fundamental sectors yielded immense wealth and shaped the nation’s economic landscape. The dollar amounts in these categories, he emphasizes, are truly significant.

With its secure infrastructure , growing regulatory alignment, and network effects, ETH is proving it can securely and efficiently handle large-scale institutional settlements. How Ethereum Became the Rails for Tokenized Treasuries In an X post , crypto trader MoonKing recently highlighted a significant trend in the financial world, stating that Ethereum is becoming the settlement layer for traditional finance (TradFi). Since January, the tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Ethereum have surged 20-fold, and the momentum shows no signs of slowing down. The capital flows that were once confined to testnets and pilots are now moving decisively into production-level deployments on the ETH mainnet. This transition is supported by real yield and a growing regulatory traction, which together are driving greater institutional confidence. The leading institutions, like BlackRock, Plume, Ondo Finance, Superstate, and Franklin Templeton, are building with a clear intent to reshape financial infrastructure by leveraging blockchain. Their focus is not just on speculative crypto trading but on bringing US treasuries, credit products, and other yield-bearing assets directly into on-chain. This strategic movement signals a paradigm shift , as traditional finance is integrating with decentralized platforms to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility. With ETF momentum building, stablecoin adoption is surging, and now a wave of real-world asset (RWA) inflows is accelerating, ETH is rapidly cementing its role as core financial infrastructure, which has become harder to ignore.

Recently, the digital asset firm Galaxy Digital made headlines with a substantial transfer of Bitcoin, prompting analysts and investors alike to ponder the potential implications for the market. This development has brought the concept of Bitcoin sell pressure to the forefront, raising questions about market dynamics and the sentiment of long-term holders. What’s Behind the Recent Bitcoin Sell Pressure from Galaxy Digital? Galaxy Digital, a prominent name in the institutional crypto space, has once again become a focal point of market discussion. The firm reportedly withdrew a staggering 2,500 BTC, valued at approximately $296 million, and moved it to various exchanges. This action, according to CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, is a significant indicator that could signal potential Bitcoin sell pressure on the market. Large-Scale Transfer: The movement of 2,500 BTC is not a trivial sum. For context, this represents a substantial chunk of liquidity potentially entering the market. Exchange Deposits: When large amounts of Bitcoin are moved to exchanges, it often suggests an intent to sell. Exchanges are the primary venues for trading, and such transfers typically precede sell orders. Precedent from Past Sales: This recent move follows a much larger, earlier transaction by Galaxy Digital – an over-the-counter (OTC) sale of 80,000 BTC. While OTC sales usually have less direct immediate impact on exchange prices, they demonstrate a pattern of large-scale asset management and liquidity provision by the firm. These movements are not just isolated incidents; they are part of a broader narrative of how institutional players manage their vast crypto holdings and how these actions can ripple through the entire ecosystem. The sheer volume involved in these transfers makes them noteworthy and a key factor in assessing immediate market sentiment and potential price trends. Unpacking the Dynamics of Institutional Bitcoin Moves When an entity like Galaxy Digital makes a move of this magnitude, it’s more than just a simple transaction; it’s a strategic decision that can influence market perception and actual price action. Understanding the dynamics of institutional Bitcoin sell pressure requires looking beyond the surface numbers. Institutions operate differently from individual retail investors. Their trades are typically larger, more strategic, and often involve a longer-term outlook or specific portfolio rebalancing needs. Here’s why Galaxy Digital’s actions matter: Aspect Retail Investor Behavior Institutional Investor Behavior Trade Size Smaller, often reactive to daily news. Massive, can significantly impact liquidity. Motivation Quick gains, fear of missing out (FOMO), panic selling. Portfolio rebalancing, risk management, strategic allocation, liquidity provision. Market Impact Limited individual impact, collective retail action can move market. Direct and immediate impact on price and sentiment, especially for large transfers to exchanges. Transparency Often public on exchanges. Can involve OTC deals, making direct impact less visible initially. At the time of these reports, Bitcoin was trading around $117,513. While this price point indicates strong overall market health, any significant inflow of supply from large holders can create downward pressure, even if temporary. The market closely watches such moves, as they can indicate whether major players are taking profits, reallocating assets, or preparing for a shift in market conditions. Is Long-Term Holder Sentiment Shifting Amidst Growing Institutional Activity? One of the most crucial aspects of Bitcoin’s market structure is the behavior of its long-term holders (LTHs). These are entities that hold Bitcoin for extended periods, often accumulating during dips and holding through volatility, reflecting a strong belief in Bitcoin’s future value. The recent actions by Galaxy Digital, and similar institutional maneuvers, naturally raise questions about how this might influence long-term holder sentiment. U.Today reported that these moves are indeed sparking discussions about the confidence of long-term holders. While the core philosophy of LTHs is to HODL, sustained periods of potential Bitcoin sell pressure from large entities could test even the most resilient convictions. However, it’s also important to consider the broader context: Maturing Market: The cryptocurrency market is maturing, with more sophisticated institutional participants entering the space. Their activities, while potentially causing short-term volatility, also signal increased adoption and integration into traditional finance.

Trump is widely expected to soon issue an executive order that calls for American''s retirement plans — the 401(k)s that represent a vast segment of U.S. investing — to open further to less traditional assets, which reportedly may include cryptocurrencies . If that comes to pass, it could ease a major portion of the investing public into digital assets, though it remains a market that still lacks formal U.S. rules. His administration''s report on crypto demanded under Trump''s January order on digital assets policy is also set to emerge on Wednesday , and it''s expected by crypto insiders to be lengthy and wide-ranging. The industry will be looking closely for updates on the federal formation of crypto reserves — including the so-called Bitcoin Strategic Reserve — and information on other initiatives, potentially including crypto tax matters. Trump''s director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, William Pulte, also recently ordered government-backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make plans to include a borrower''s crypto holdings among assets that can back up their mortgage. That move has now drawn opposition from Democratic lawmakers, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who have steadily opposed Trump''s crypto maneuvers. ""Expanding underwriting criteria to include the consideration of unconverted cryptocurrency assets could pose risks to the stability of the housing market and the financial system,"" according to a letter to Pulte from several Democratic senators alongside Warren — the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. The letter cited crypto''s high volatility as a danger in the underwriting of mortgages. If crypto found entry into everyday retirement savings, mortgage lending and became a significant reserve in federal fiscal policy, the shifts could dramatically expand usage and appetite for crypto in the U.S., which the president has vowed will become the world capital for digital assets. Opposition Democrats had suffered a crushing setback in this month''s congressional actions that saw a major segment of their party support crypto initiatives. However, the larger test is still coming, when the Senate tries to move forward on its bill to establish rules for U.S. crypto markets. Now that the stablecoin oversight has been established with the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act with which Trump marked a first big win during this month''s Crypto Week, the Senate needs to get sufficient support for its legislative effort on market structure, seen in partial draft form last week . Though the House of Representatives approved a similar bill known as the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, the Senate is working on its own legislation that will need to again clear more than 60 yes votes, which means a repeat of GENIUS'' hefty support from Democrats. The industry is facing a deadline next week of Aug. 5 to give the lawmakers some feedback on the discussion draft, though that date is beyond the Senate''s August recess in which lawmakers will generally be away from Washington for their summer break.

2025-07-28 19:25:10+00:00,Crucial Bitcoin Forfeiture: DOJ Targets Ransomware Group’s Ill-Gotten Gains,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Bitcoin Forfeiture: DOJ Targets Ransomware Group’s Ill-Gotten Gains The digital frontier, while promising innovation and financial freedom, also presents new battlegrounds for law enforcement. In a significant move that underscores the escalating global fight against cybercrime, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has taken decisive action, signaling a powerful message to illicit actors operating in the shadows of the internet. This latest development involves a substantial sum of Bitcoin forfeiture , directly targeting funds linked to a notorious ransomware group, marking another crucial step in reclaiming stolen digital assets. The Landmark Bitcoin Forfeiture Case Against Chaos Ransomware In a compelling demonstration of its commitment to combating cybercrime, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed a civil complaint aimed at securing the ownership of approximately $2.3 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This significant sum was seized in mid-April and is directly associated with the ransomware group known as “Chaos.” As reported by Decrypt, this legal maneuver represents a concerted effort by federal authorities to disrupt the financial infrastructure of cybercriminals who leverage cryptocurrencies for their illicit activities. The Chaos ransomware group, like many of its counterparts, has exploited vulnerabilities in digital systems to encrypt sensitive data, demanding hefty Bitcoin payments from victims for its release. These attacks cause significant financial damage and disrupt critical services. The DOJ’s action in seeking this specific Bitcoin forfeiture sends a clear signal: the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions is not an impenetrable shield against justice. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly sophisticated in their ability to trace, identify, and seize digital assets acquired through illegal means. This case highlights key aspects of the ongoing struggle: Proactive Enforcement: The mid-April seizure indicates a swift response to the ransomware group’s activities. Targeted Disruption: Authorities aim to cripple operational capabilities by targeting the financial lifeline of these groups. Legal Precedent: Each successful Bitcoin forfeiture case strengthens future enforcement actions. Understanding Civil Forfeiture: How Governments Reclaim Illicit Crypto What exactly is civil forfeiture, and why is it the chosen mechanism for recovering assets like Bitcoin? Civil forfeiture is a legal process through which law enforcement agencies can seize assets believed to be connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is not convicted. For cryptocurrencies, this mechanism has become a vital tool. Here’s a simplified breakdown of its application to digital assets: Identification & Tracing: Investigators use blockchain analytics tools to trace illicit funds from victims to criminal wallets. Bitcoin’s public ledger, despite pseudonymity, allows for sophisticated tracing. Seizure: With a warrant or court order, law enforcement seizes the cryptocurrency. This often involves accessing private keys or working with exchanges. Civil Complaint: The government files a civil complaint, alleging the assets’ involvement in criminal activity. This is the current stage for the Chaos ransomware Bitcoin. Forfeiture Proceedings: If no legitimate claim is made, or the court rules in the government’s favor, the assets are formally forfeited to the state. This adaptability of legal frameworks to new technologies provides a pathway for victims to recover funds and removes incentives for cybercriminals. A Growing Trend: The U.S. Government’s Stance on Crypto Crime The U.S. Department of Justice’s pursuit of this Bitcoin forfeiture is part of a broader, intensifying campaign against illicit cryptocurrency use. Over recent years, federal agencies have significantly ramped up their capabilities and focus. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021, where the DOJ recovered millions in Bitcoin ransom, was a watershed moment, proving large-scale crypto seizures are increasingly common. Other notable examples include: Silk Road Seizures: Billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin linked to the defunct darknet marketplace, recovered years after its initial shutdown. State-Sponsored Hacking: Ongoing efforts to seize crypto assets stolen by groups involved in cybercrimes like bank heists. Specialized Enforcement Teams: Agencies like the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) have established units dedicated to tracking and seizing digital assets. These actions signal a fundamental shift: perceived crypto anonymity is becoming a liability for criminals.

BitcoinWorld Crucial Bitcoin Forfeiture: DOJ Targets Ransomware Group’s Ill-Gotten Gains The digital frontier, while promising innovation and financial freedom, also presents new battlegrounds for law enforcement. In a significant move that underscores the escalating global fight against cybercrime, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has taken decisive action, signaling a powerful message to illicit actors operating in the shadows of the internet. This latest development involves a substantial sum of Bitcoin forfeiture , directly targeting funds linked to a notorious ransomware group, marking another crucial step in reclaiming stolen digital assets. The Landmark Bitcoin Forfeiture Case Against Chaos Ransomware In a compelling demonstration of its commitment to combating cybercrime, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed a civil complaint aimed at securing the ownership of approximately $2.3 million worth of Bitcoin (BTC). This significant sum was seized in mid-April and is directly associated with the ransomware group known as “Chaos.” As reported by Decrypt, this legal maneuver represents a concerted effort by federal authorities to disrupt the financial infrastructure of cybercriminals who leverage cryptocurrencies for their illicit activities. The Chaos ransomware group, like many of its counterparts, has exploited vulnerabilities in digital systems to encrypt sensitive data, demanding hefty Bitcoin payments from victims for its release. These attacks cause significant financial damage and disrupt critical services. The DOJ’s action in seeking this specific Bitcoin forfeiture sends a clear signal: the perceived anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions is not an impenetrable shield against justice. Law enforcement agencies are increasingly sophisticated in their ability to trace, identify, and seize digital assets acquired through illegal means. This case highlights key aspects of the ongoing struggle: Proactive Enforcement: The mid-April seizure indicates a swift response to the ransomware group’s activities. Targeted Disruption: Authorities aim to cripple operational capabilities by targeting the financial lifeline of these groups. Legal Precedent: Each successful Bitcoin forfeiture case strengthens future enforcement actions. Understanding Civil Forfeiture: How Governments Reclaim Illicit Crypto What exactly is civil forfeiture, and why is it the chosen mechanism for recovering assets like Bitcoin? Civil forfeiture is a legal process through which law enforcement agencies can seize assets believed to be connected to criminal activity, even if the owner is not convicted. For cryptocurrencies, this mechanism has become a vital tool. Here’s a simplified breakdown of its application to digital assets: Identification & Tracing: Investigators use blockchain analytics tools to trace illicit funds from victims to criminal wallets. Bitcoin’s public ledger, despite pseudonymity, allows for sophisticated tracing. Seizure: With a warrant or court order, law enforcement seizes the cryptocurrency. This often involves accessing private keys or working with exchanges. Civil Complaint: The government files a civil complaint, alleging the assets’ involvement in criminal activity. This is the current stage for the Chaos ransomware Bitcoin. Forfeiture Proceedings: If no legitimate claim is made, or the court rules in the government’s favor, the assets are formally forfeited to the state. This adaptability of legal frameworks to new technologies provides a pathway for victims to recover funds and removes incentives for cybercriminals. A Growing Trend: The U.S. Government’s Stance on Crypto Crime The U.S. Department of Justice’s pursuit of this Bitcoin forfeiture is part of a broader, intensifying campaign against illicit cryptocurrency use. Over recent years, federal agencies have significantly ramped up their capabilities and focus. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021, where the DOJ recovered millions in Bitcoin ransom, was a watershed moment, proving large-scale crypto seizures are increasingly common. Other notable examples include: Silk Road Seizures: Billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin linked to the defunct darknet marketplace, recovered years after its initial shutdown. State-Sponsored Hacking: Ongoing efforts to seize crypto assets stolen by groups involved in cybercrimes like bank heists. Specialized Enforcement Teams: Agencies like the FBI and IRS Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) have established units dedicated to tracking and seizing digital assets. These actions signal a fundamental shift: perceived crypto anonymity is becoming a liability for criminals. Enhanced public, private, and international collaboration has improved tracing capabilities, making it harder for criminals to cash out undetected.

Cryptocurrency analyst Maarten Regterschot argued that this rise of BNB is not just a wave of speculation, but the result of long-term fundamental dynamics. According to Regterschot, BNB is now the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, excluding Bitcoin and stablecoins, with its total market capitalization rising to $112 billion. While many altcoins performed poorly throughout 2024, BNB continued to gain steadily. Regterschot noted that its steady price increase since the beginning of the year has placed it just behind Bitcoin.

According to the analyst, this ratio indicates that investors are receiving 2.5 units of return for one unit of risk. This, he believes, is one of the reasons for the recent surge.

2025-07-28 20:00:39+00:00,Founder of Turkish crypto exchange ICRYPEX has been detained in Turkey,"Law enforcement authorities in Turkey have detained the founder of a cryptocurrency exchange, who allegedly funded a prominent journalist, himself recently arrested for criticizing the ruling elite. The businessman is under investigation for allegedly supplying narcotics to a victim whom he is also accused of trying to kill. The coin trading platform he was managing has been geared for global expansion, the Turkish press noted. Crypto executive jailed in Turkey on drug and murder charges Gökalp İçer, chair of the Board of Directors of the Turkish digital asset exchange ICRYPEX, has been detained in Istanbul, Hürriyet Daily News and Türkiye Today informed readers in separate reports. The entrepreneur has been taken into custody on charges of “procuring drugs” and “attempted murder with probable intent,” the English-language editions unveiled, quoting the city’s Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office. Its statement details that investigators went after İçer when the victim, identified only by their initials, G.Ç., was hospitalized in intensive care on July 14, this year, after consuming narcotics allegedly provided by the suspect. The person remains in critical condition, and the investigation is still underway to establish all circumstances in the case, the publications added. ICRYPEX was founded by İçer in the spring of 2018. The Turkey-based crypto exchange has been trying to grow beyond its domestic market, having already opened branches in Dubai, London, and Toronto. As part of its push to become a global player, the Turkish platform sought to increase its presence in Latin America and South Africa, Hürriyet highlighted. The move against its executive is likely to affect these plans. Moreover, it comes against the backdrop of a major crackdown on crypto service providers in Turkey , which resulted in the blocking of dozens of websites, accused by the nation’s top financial regulator of unlicensed activities. Turkish media links İçer’s detention to Altaylı’s arrest According to Türkiye Today, ICRYPEX is linked to Fatih Altaylı , a renowned journalist and former TV host in Turkey who recently found himself in trouble with the government over critical comments regarding its leadership. The crypto company has been reportedly sponsoring Altaylı’s broadcasts on YouTube, one of which led to his detention and subsequent arrest last month. Altaylı was taken to jail on June 21 and charged with “threatening the President” with remarks he made in a video posted on his channel . Authorities interpreted those as targeting Turkey’s long-serving head of state, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In the live stream aired the previous day, the journalist had stated that, historically, Turks have always questioned the authority of their rulers, even during Ottoman times, emphasizing public expectations of accountability from high-level officials. Prosecutors from the same Istanbul office insisted his statements constituted an offense under an article of Turkey’s criminal code meant to prevent attacks on the president as a significant institution. In a testimony, Altaylı denied making any threats against the president, explaining he was merely sharing his opinion on poll results showing that some 70% of Turkish people would oppose allowing Erdoğan to remain in power indefinitely. He argued that his political commentary had been distorted by opponents who circulated only a short clip, edited in a way to create the impression he was threatening the Turkish leader, which went viral on social media. He also submitted the full record to back his claims. Speaking in the presence of lawyers, Altaylı elaborated: “There is absolutely no expression in my speech that can be interpreted as a threat or even an implication of one against the President. The statements have been deliberately distorted by removing their context. I am not responsible for this misrepresentation.” “I did not threaten President Erdogan. I only provided historical context. I do not accept the charges brought against me,” Altaylı reiterated later in court, but the judge concluded his statements did amount to a criminal threat against Erdogan and ordered him held in pretrial detention. The ruling sparked condemnation from colleagues and calls for his release. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

2025-07-28 20:25:11+00:00,U.S. Stock Market’s Pivotal Day: Navigating Mixed Signals,"BitcoinWorld U.S. Stock Market’s Pivotal Day: Navigating Mixed Signals In the ever-evolving landscape of global finance, the performance of the U.S. stock market often serves as a barometer for broader economic health. For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors, understanding these traditional market movements is not just an academic exercise; it’s a crucial part of anticipating potential shifts in the digital asset space. Recently, the three major U.S. stock market indices concluded trading with a mixed bag of results, sparking discussions across trading desks and online forums alike. This seemingly subtle divergence holds significant implications, signaling underlying complexities that warrant a closer look for anyone navigating the interconnected worlds of traditional finance and crypto. What Do Mixed Signals from the U.S. Stock Market Indices Tell Us? On a recent trading day, the performance of the leading U.S. stock market indices presented a nuanced picture: S&P 500: Closed up by a marginal +0.02%. Nasdaq Composite: Saw a more notable gain of +0.33%. Dow Jones Industrial Average: Dipped slightly by -0.14%. This mixed outcome is more than just a collection of numbers; it reflects different sectors of the economy experiencing varying pressures and opportunities. The S&P 500, often considered the broadest measure of the U.S. equity market, remained nearly flat, indicating a general equilibrium. The Nasdaq’s positive movement suggests continued strength in technology and growth stocks, which often thrive on innovation and future potential. Conversely, the slight decline in the Dow, heavily weighted towards industrial and traditional blue-chip companies, might point to concerns in sectors more sensitive to interest rates or inflation. To put this into perspective, here’s a snapshot of the day’s closing: Index Daily Change Primary Focus S&P 500 +0.02% Broad Market Performance Nasdaq Composite +0.33% Technology & Growth Stocks Dow Jones Industrial Average -0.14% Industrial & Blue-Chip Stocks Why Did the U.S. Stock Market Experience Such a Diverse Close? The reasons behind a mixed market close are often multifaceted, reflecting a complex interplay of economic indicators, corporate earnings, and investor sentiment. Several factors could contribute to such a scenario: Inflationary Concerns: Persistent inflation data can lead to expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, which might weigh on traditional industries (Dow) but have less immediate impact on growth-oriented tech companies (Nasdaq) that are often valued on future earnings potential. Interest Rate Speculation: Uncertainty surrounding the Fed’s next move on interest rates can cause investors to rotate capital. Higher rates can make borrowing more expensive, impacting businesses, but might also signal economic strength. Corporate Earnings Reports: Strong earnings from key technology companies could have bolstered the Nasdaq, while mixed or weaker reports from other sectors might have dragged down the Dow. Geopolitical Developments: Global events, from supply chain disruptions to international conflicts, can create uncertainty that affects different market sectors unevenly. For instance, energy or commodity-related news might impact industrial stocks more directly. Understanding these underlying currents is vital, as they paint a picture of economic health that can spill over into other asset classes, including digital currencies. How Does U.S. Stock Market Performance Influence the Crypto Landscape? While often viewed as distinct, the traditional U.S. stock market and the cryptocurrency market are increasingly intertwined. The mixed close, in particular, offers several insights for crypto investors: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: When traditional markets show signs of instability or uncertainty (like a mixed close rather than a clear upward trend), investors might shift to ‘risk-off’ assets. Historically, this could sometimes benefit perceived safe havens, but crypto, particularly Bitcoin, has often behaved like a ‘risk-on’ asset, correlating with tech stocks. The Nasdaq’s strength might suggest a continued appetite for growth assets, which could indirectly support crypto. Liquidity Flows: Major movements in the stock market can impact the availability of capital for other investments. If investors are rebalancing portfolios within equities, less capital might flow into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies in the short term. Economic Confidence: A stable or moderately growing traditional market often fosters a general sense of economic confidence. This can encourage broader investment, including into emerging asset classes like crypto. A mixed market, however, introduces an element of caution. Institutional Adoption: As more institutional players enter the crypto space, their investment decisions are often influenced by their broader macroeconomic outlook, which is heavily shaped by the performance of the U.S. stock market .

2025-07-28 20:30:00+00:00,Stablecoins Look Here To Stay,"Summary Recent U.S. law cements the role of stablecoins as a means of digital payment in the future of finance. We still see bitcoin as a potential return diversifier. U.S. stocks pushed to all-time highs, partly on signs of big tech companies upping AI investment plans. Japanese stocks also hit record highs. We expect the Fed will hold rates steady this week. We watch for U.S. trade deals as the Aug. 1 deadline approaches and for tariff impacts in Q2 GDP data. Transcript New U.S. legislation is cementing the role of stablecoins as part of the future of finance. We think their adoption could bolster the dollar’s dominance in global markets. 1) Going mainstream Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a fiat currency – typically the U.S. dollar – and backed by reserve assets. They fuse the frictionless transfer of cryptocurrency with the perceived stability of fiat currency. The U.S. is advancing several laws aimed at bringing stablecoins and other digital assets into the mainstream. The Genius Act creates a comprehensive stablecoin framework. It defines stablecoins as a payment method, not an asset; spells out who can issue them; and prohibits these issuers from paying interest. We think it has implications for the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasury bills. 2) Limited impact on Treasury yields U.S. Treasury bills are one of the assets the Genius Act allows stablecoin issuers to hold in reserve. So growing demand for stablecoins could boost demand for Treasury bills. But we think that demand could be offset by two things. One, money flowing out of assets similar to Treasury bills, like money market funds. And two, a likely surge in newly issued Treasury bills. That means the impact on bill yields may be limited. 3) Reinforcing dollar dominance The Genius Act could reinforce dollar dominance by enabling a tokenized U.S. dollar-based ecosystem for international payments. Stablecoins may offer users in emerging markets easier access to the U.S. dollar over volatile local currencies. Yet in major economies, the ban on interest payments could slow adoption. The ban aims to protect banking by preventing a low-friction rival that could compete with bank deposits and hurt traditional lending. We see stablecoins as a new part of the future of finance – and this U.S. legislation is aiming to put the U.S. at the center of cryptocurrency innovation. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- New U.S. legislation – notably this month’s Genius Act – is cementing the role of stablecoins as a payment method in the future of finance, one of five mega forces we see driving returns. Stablecoins are pegged to major currencies, mainly the U.S. dollar and could solidify its dominance in global markets, though other countries are exploring alternatives. We think rising demand for stablecoins will have little impact on short-term Treasury yields. We still see bitcoin as a distinct return driver. This has been a banner year for bitcoin, up 25% this year as the U.S. is in the process of adopting a couple of key laws aimed at bringing digital payments and assets into the mainstream – and making the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. One determines which financial regulator oversees different digital assets. That bill is still working its way through Congress. Another – the Genius Act, signed into law earlier this month – creates a comprehensive payment stablecoin framework. Stablecoins are digital tokens pegged to a fiat currency and backed by reserve assets. They fuse the frictionless transfer of crypto with the perceived stability of fiat currency. Though stablecoins are small relative to the size of the overall crypto universe at a 7% share, their adoption has grown quickly since 2020 to reach about $250 billion. See the chart. We see two implications of the Genius Act on the U.S. dollar and Treasury bills. The act defines stablecoins to function as a payment method, not an investment product; prohibits issuers from paying interest; and limits issuance to federally regulated banks, some registered nonbanks and state-chartered firms. This regulation could reinforce dollar dominance by enabling a tokenized U.S. dollar-based ecosystem for international payments. Users in emerging markets may get easier access to the U.S. dollar over volatile local currencies. Yet in major economies, adoption may be limited by the ban on interest payments, which aims to prevent a low-friction rival that could compete with bank deposits and hurt traditional lending. Implications of the Genius Act The act also spells out what assets stablecoin issuers may hold in reserve: mostly repurchase agreements, money market funds and U.S. Treasury bills with a maturity of 93 days or less. Leading stablecoin issuers Tether and Circle together hold at least $120 billion in Treasury bills, only about 2% of the Treasury’s roughly $6 trillion bills outstanding.

2025-07-28 20:30:38+00:00,Bitcoin Backfire: How A $20-M Employee Heist Crashed Into Prison Time,"In Beijing, prosecutors have jailed eight people for running a year‑long Bitcoin scam that drained over 140 million yuan—around $20 million—from a short‐video platform and then funneled the cash into crypto. According to a White Paper released by the People’s Procuratorate of Haidian District, the case ranks among the most complex anti‑corruption cases handled between 2020 and 2024. What began as simple bonus approvals inside the company turned into a year‑long scheme that hid stolen funds behind shell firms and digital currencies. Insider Power Opened Loopholes Based on reports , an employee named Feng held sole control over service‑provider onboarding, bonus qualifications and payout approvals. He quietly tweaked bonus policies to create gaps that only he and two outside helpers, Tang and Yang, could exploit. Fake documents flowed in with private data that Feng leaked. Then the trio rerouted bonus payments into made‑up accounts, instead of rewarding real work. By the time auditors spotted the missing cash, nearly 140 million yuan had already vanished. Fake Firms And Laundering Chain The gang used shell companies with no real operations. Yang directed associate Wang and others to set up around 10 of these paper businesses. All they did was collect the bogus bonus payouts. From there, funds jumped across multiple bank accounts until they landed in Yang’s hands. Feng then ordered the next step: converting it into Bitcoin . They split the loot on eight different international platforms and mixed the coins, scrambling the transaction trail to hide the money’s origin. Authorities Trace Bitcoin Flow Prosecutor Li Tao, of Haidian’s Science and Technology Crime division, built a detailed map of the scam. By comparing company data logs, bank records and blockchain transfers, his team peeled back each layer of concealment. They even recovered over 90 Bitcoin during the investigation—enough to prove exactly how the “closed‑loop” laundering chain worked. Each recovered coin tied back to the stolen rewards, confirming every twist of the money’s path. Sentencing took into account each person’s role. Feng received the longest term—14 years and six months behind bars—while the other seven were handed prison sentences ranging from three to 14 years, plus hefty fines. All were found guilty of occupational embezzlement. This case serves as a warning: when one person holds too much power, even routine bonus systems can become vehicles for big fraud—and modern crypto tools can’t guarantee anonymity forever.

2025-07-28 22:15:11+00:00,Bakkt’s Bold Bitcoin Investment: Unpacking the Market Impact,"BitcoinWorld Bakkt’s Bold Bitcoin Investment: Unpacking the Market Impact In a move that has sent ripples across both the cryptocurrency and traditional stock markets, Bakkt, a prominent cryptocurrency trading and custody platform, has announced audacious plans to raise capital. The primary objective? To significantly bolster its Bitcoin holdings. This strategic shift, a deeper dive into Bakkt Bitcoin investment , was initially reported by Unfolded via X, immediately capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. While the exact amount of this fundraising endeavor through the issuance of Class A common stock remains undisclosed, its stated purpose – to acquire Bitcoin and fund working capital – has already triggered a dramatic response: Bakkt’s stock price plummeted by more than 30% in after-hours trading. This isn’t Bakkt’s first flirtation with substantial Bitcoin acquisitions. The company had previously outlined ambitions to pursue a staggering $1 billion paid-in capital increase with the explicit aim of purchasing Bitcoin. Such a declaration from a publicly traded, institutionally backed crypto platform underscores a growing trend, yet also highlights the inherent volatility and investor apprehension that can accompany direct exposure to digital assets. What’s Driving Bakkt’s Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy? At first glance, the decision by a major crypto platform like Bakkt to raise funds specifically for Bitcoin acquisition might seem intuitive. After all, Bitcoin is the foundational cryptocurrency, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ and its long-term potential is a subject of intense debate and belief within the crypto community. But what are the deeper motivations behind this particular Bakkt Bitcoin investment strategy? Strategic Asset Allocation: For many companies, holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation and a strategic long-term asset. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted this approach, betting big on Bitcoin’s future appreciation. Bakkt, being a crypto-native company, might view Bitcoin as a core treasury asset that aligns with its business model and vision for a decentralized financial future. Enhanced Liquidity and Operational Flexibility: While a significant portion of the funds is earmarked for Bitcoin, the mention of ‘funding working capital’ is crucial. This suggests that the fundraising isn’t solely about accumulating BTC as an investment but also about strengthening Bakkt’s overall financial position to support its ongoing operations, product development, and expansion initiatives in a dynamic market. Signaling Confidence: By making a direct and substantial investment in Bitcoin, Bakkt could be sending a strong signal to the market about its conviction in the long-term viability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This could potentially attract investors who are bullish on crypto and seek companies that are deeply integrated into the digital asset space. Competitive Positioning: In an increasingly crowded crypto landscape, differentiating oneself is key. A substantial Bitcoin holding could serve as a unique selling proposition, demonstrating Bakkt’s commitment and potentially attracting institutional clients looking for platforms with robust digital asset strategies. The Immediate Market Reaction: Why Did Bakkt’s Stock Plunge? Despite the potential strategic upsides, the immediate aftermath of Bakkt’s announcement saw its stock price take a significant hit. A more than 30% drop in after-hours trading is a stark indicator of investor concern. This sharp decline can be attributed to several factors, highlighting the delicate balance between crypto enthusiasm and traditional market prudence when it comes to a company’s Bakkt Bitcoin investment plan: Share Dilution Fears: The primary concern for investors when a company issues new stock is dilution. By increasing the number of outstanding shares, the value of existing shares is typically diluted. Investors often interpret this as a reduction in their ownership stake and future earnings per share, leading to a sell-off. Uncertainty Regarding Fund Size: The undisclosed amount of the fundraising creates significant uncertainty. Without knowing the exact scale of the issuance, investors are left to speculate, and in volatile markets, speculation often leads to conservative reactions and selling pressure. Bitcoin Volatility Concerns: While Bitcoin offers immense upside potential, it is also notoriously volatile. Publicly traded companies holding large amounts of Bitcoin expose their balance sheets to significant price fluctuations, which can introduce unpredictable swings in their financial performance.

BitcoinWorld Bakkt’s Bold Bitcoin Investment: Unpacking the Market Impact In a move that has sent ripples across both the cryptocurrency and traditional stock markets, Bakkt, a prominent cryptocurrency trading and custody platform, has announced audacious plans to raise capital. The primary objective? To significantly bolster its Bitcoin holdings. This strategic shift, a deeper dive into Bakkt Bitcoin investment , was initially reported by Unfolded via X, immediately capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. While the exact amount of this fundraising endeavor through the issuance of Class A common stock remains undisclosed, its stated purpose – to acquire Bitcoin and fund working capital – has already triggered a dramatic response: Bakkt’s stock price plummeted by more than 30% in after-hours trading. This isn’t Bakkt’s first flirtation with substantial Bitcoin acquisitions. The company had previously outlined ambitions to pursue a staggering $1 billion paid-in capital increase with the explicit aim of purchasing Bitcoin. Such a declaration from a publicly traded, institutionally backed crypto platform underscores a growing trend, yet also highlights the inherent volatility and investor apprehension that can accompany direct exposure to digital assets. What’s Driving Bakkt’s Bold Bitcoin Investment Strategy? At first glance, the decision by a major crypto platform like Bakkt to raise funds specifically for Bitcoin acquisition might seem intuitive. After all, Bitcoin is the foundational cryptocurrency, often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ and its long-term potential is a subject of intense debate and belief within the crypto community. But what are the deeper motivations behind this particular Bakkt Bitcoin investment strategy? Strategic Asset Allocation: For many companies, holding Bitcoin on their balance sheet is increasingly seen as a hedge against inflation and a strategic long-term asset. Companies like MicroStrategy have famously adopted this approach, betting big on Bitcoin’s future appreciation. Bakkt, being a crypto-native company, might view Bitcoin as a core treasury asset that aligns with its business model and vision for a decentralized financial future. Enhanced Liquidity and Operational Flexibility: While a significant portion of the funds is earmarked for Bitcoin, the mention of ‘funding working capital’ is crucial. This suggests that the fundraising isn’t solely about accumulating BTC as an investment but also about strengthening Bakkt’s overall financial position to support its ongoing operations, product development, and expansion initiatives in a dynamic market. Signaling Confidence: By making a direct and substantial investment in Bitcoin, Bakkt could be sending a strong signal to the market about its conviction in the long-term viability and growth of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. This could potentially attract investors who are bullish on crypto and seek companies that are deeply integrated into the digital asset space. Competitive Positioning: In an increasingly crowded crypto landscape, differentiating oneself is key. A substantial Bitcoin holding could serve as a unique selling proposition, demonstrating Bakkt’s commitment and potentially attracting institutional clients looking for platforms with robust digital asset strategies. The Immediate Market Reaction: Why Did Bakkt’s Stock Plunge? Despite the potential strategic upsides, the immediate aftermath of Bakkt’s announcement saw its stock price take a significant hit. A more than 30% drop in after-hours trading is a stark indicator of investor concern. This sharp decline can be attributed to several factors, highlighting the delicate balance between crypto enthusiasm and traditional market prudence when it comes to a company’s Bakkt Bitcoin investment plan: Share Dilution Fears: The primary concern for investors when a company issues new stock is dilution. By increasing the number of outstanding shares, the value of existing shares is typically diluted. Investors often interpret this as a reduction in their ownership stake and future earnings per share, leading to a sell-off. Uncertainty Regarding Fund Size: The undisclosed amount of the fundraising creates significant uncertainty. Without knowing the exact scale of the issuance, investors are left to speculate, and in volatile markets, speculation often leads to conservative reactions and selling pressure. Bitcoin Volatility Concerns: While Bitcoin offers immense upside potential, it is also notoriously volatile. Publicly traded companies holding large amounts of Bitcoin expose their balance sheets to significant price fluctuations, which can introduce unpredictable swings in their financial performance. Traditional investors, particularly those focused on stability and predictable earnings, may view this as an unacceptable level of risk. Working Capital vs. Investment: The dual purpose of the funds – Bitcoin acquisition and working capital – might also raise questions. I"
