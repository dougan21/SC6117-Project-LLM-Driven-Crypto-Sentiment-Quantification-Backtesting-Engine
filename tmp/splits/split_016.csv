2025-07-25 23:10:21+00:00,"Crypto Price Prediction Today 25 July – XRP, Pepe, Shiba Inu","Crypto progenitor Bitcoin’s historic move to an unprecedented price high of $122,838 last Monday reignited strong bullish sentiment among traders. Although the asset has since retreated by 5.7%, optimism remains high for another potential breakout. The rapid ascent in Bitcoin’s value has simultaneously propelled major altcoins and many of the best meme coins upwards. Tokens such as XRP, TRON, Sui Network, Solana, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have all marked fresh all-time highs within the last year, reinforcing confidence in a broader market expansion. Currently, the total crypto market cap hovers just below the $4 trillion mark. A slight market-wide correction of 5.3% over the past day indicates a stabilisation phase as prices consolidate after this powerful upswing. With expectations of a significant bull run mounting, investors are turning their focus towards digital assets with the potential to surpass previous price peaks. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payments Crypto Leader Reaches New Price Records Ripple’s XRP continues to cement itself as a key bridge between traditional finance systems and blockchain networks. On July 18, XRP climbed to a fresh record of $3.65, overtaking its former 2018 high of $3.40. XRP trades around $3.11, marking a 14.3% decline from its peak, suggesting it is entering a correction period. Nonetheless, recent developments keep traders hopeful for renewed upward movement. With its lightning-fast settlement times, negligible fees, and frictionless cross-border transacting sans intermediaries, XRP has attracted considerable institutional adoption, including from the United Nations. Following four years of litigation, Ripple secured a major victory in 2023 when a U.S. court determined that XRP’s retail sales were not securities transactions. By 2025, the SEC closed its case, ending years of regulatory uncertainty and solidifying XRP’s market standing. This clarity has driven substantial capital inflows into XRP, resulting in a price surge of over 413% in the last 365 days, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 81% increase over the year. XRP’s RSI dipped to 60 from Monday’s overheated level of 86, indicating growing selling momentum. After a remarkable 44% rally over the past month – significantly outperforming Bitcoin’s 9% rise – traders are now realising their profits and will likely continue doing so over the weekend, depreciating the price and providing a buy-in opportunity. Over the past 7 days, XRP declined by 10% and may continue easing until its RSI reaches a neutral 50 and its price aligns with its 30-day moving average. Further losses are likely to be minimal, since XRP enjoys strong psychological support near its previous resistance level at $3. Between late last year and early April, XRP formed a bullish flag pattern, a structure often preceding strong upward moves, implying that a push towards $4 could materialise by autumn. Pepe ($PEPE): The Biggest Frog in Crypto Eyes New Price Highs In less than two years, Pepe ($PEPE) rose to become one of the top three meme coins, leveraging its cultural relevance to build substantial market dominance. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic frog character, Pepe has delivered impressive returns to early holders, reaching a market cap over $5.1 billion. Since its launch in April 2023, Pepe has inspired countless copycats, yet none have managed to match its momentum. The token’s profile skyrocketed further when X CEO Elon Musk briefly adopted a Pepe-themed avatar. Currently trading around $0.00001221, Pepe has gained 23% in the past month. Despite this, it remains 56.4% below its late-2024 historic peak of $0.00002803. Earlier this year, Pepe charted a falling wedge formation, a technical setup often preceding upward breakouts. With its RSI at 52 and downtrending, a selloff is ensuing which could discount the popular meme coin further over the weekend, presenting a prime opportunity for investors to buy in. While crypto’s broader $3.9 trillion market dipped 5.3%, Pepe has held the fort with only a 2% decline, mirroring Bitcoin and reflecting the fact that larger market cap meme coins can often retain value more like traditional cryptocurrencies as the market grows. Pepe enthusiasts remain hopeful that favourable crypto market conditions and geopolitical stability will ignite another surge before summer concludes. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Ethereum-Based Dogecoin Challenger Could Triple in Price Since launching in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has become the second-largest meme cryptocurrency after Dogecoin, with a market cap stretching to nearly $8 billion. SHIB has slipped 0.3% in the past 24 hours and is now trading near $0.00001347. Given the fact that crypto’s wider $79 billion meme coin market dipped 4.4% in the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu’s nominal decline highlights its robustness and resillience as a meme coin. The token remains well-positioned for a potential major rally.

2025-07-25 23:24:00+00:00,Saylor’s Strategy Expands Stretch Shares Amid Surging Investor Demand,"Saylor announced an increase in the new STRC share offering from $500 million to $2.8 billion. The rise was driven by strong investor demand, as the shares offer a 9% annual dividend. These preferred shares have higher payout priority than regular shares. Bitcoin enthusiast and co-founder of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), Michael Saylor, has announced an increase in the offering of preferred shares from $500 million to $2.8 billion, citing strong investor demand, according to Bloomberg . The new shares, named Stretch (STRC), offer a 9% annual dividend and have no fixed maturity date, an uncommon feature even among complex exchange-traded instruments. The publication highlighted this move as further proof of Saylor’s unique strategy: transforming a former IT company into a global Bitcoin treasury giant. Strategy initially announced the issuance of STRC shares to raise $500 million for additional Bitcoin purchases. Despite the complexity of the company’s capital structure and rising risks, there has been overwhelming demand for the new issue. Shares are being sold at a discounted price of $90 per share, compared to the nominal $100—a move designed to attract even more investors, especially among Saylor’s retail following. In recent years, Strategy has introduced several innovative financial instruments, including other share types such as Strike, Stride, and Strife, which have proven popular with investors. According to a person familiar with the deal, the new Stretch shares rank above regular common shares in the capital structure but remain subordinate to convertible bonds. The company can adjust the dividend monthly to keep the market price near $100, offering price flexibility and trust—underscoring Strategy’s unconventional approach to corporate finance. “This is not the first example of financial engineering by Strategy. If a company is valued above its fundamental value, it is a good opportunity to raise capital,” said Campbell Harvey, professor of economics at Duke University. Overall, Strategy’s shares have risen 43% year-to-date. The company’s total Bitcoin holdings have reached 607,770 BTC, valued at over $70 billion at the time of writing. Saylor continues to inspire other public companies to pursue similar crypto treasury strategies. Notably, private and public companies worldwide have accumulated a total of 1.18 million BTC.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10203/saylor-s-strategy-expands-stretch-shares-amid-surging-investor-demand,BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION|TREASURY,News|Crypto,BTC,"Saylor’s Strategy Expands Stretch Shares Amid Surging Investor Demand.

2025-07-25 23:30:04+00:00,"Analyst Forecasts $20 to $30 XRP, But There’s A Catch","A prominent commentator within the XRP community has reiterated his expectation for a significant price surge, predicting that XRP could peak between $20 and $30 in the current cycle. However, he also anticipates a sharp market correction following such a rally, warning investors to prepare accordingly. XRP Price Outlook and Cycle Top Projections Zach Rector, a well-known figure in the XRP space, continues to maintain a bullish outlook, stating that XRP has the potential to rise dramatically in the ongoing market cycle. According to Rector, a price top ranging from $20 to $30 is plausible . Despite this optimistic target, he cautioned that a major pullback could follow once XRP reaches those levels. Rector’s position is based on long-standing market behavior. He acknowledges that although some market dynamics have evolved, the core investor psychology, particularly the tendency to take profits during peaks, remains unchanged. He believes this will likely lead to a correction of up to 50% after XRP reaches its projected high. In follow-up remarks, Rector elaborated that while the traditional four-year crypto cycle may not apply as rigidly as it once did, investor behavior still drives market volatility. He emphasized that understanding these emotional responses is essential for portfolio risk management. The 4 year crypto cycles have been disrupted but people are still going to take profits. Which is why I still believe after a $20-$30 XRP top we will see atleast a 50% correction. Not encouraging folks to trade this move but instead, just making sure you are ready to stomach that… — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) July 22, 2025 Views Among Analysts Not everyone in the XRP community agrees with Rector’s outlook. Johnny Utah, another well-known XRP proponent, challenged the idea that a major correction is inevitable. He argued that the current market is fundamentally different due to increased regulatory clarity, expanding real-world adoption, and rising institutional interest, particularly through financial instruments like ETFs . Utah’s viewpoint mirrors that of Michael Saylor, an advocate for Bitcoin and executive chairman of MicroStrategy, who recently suggested that Bitcoin may not experience a substantial correction until it reaches much higher valuations. Utah believes the same may hold for XRP, suggesting that the traditional correction phase could be bypassed due to these new market conditions. While Rector acknowledged these changing factors, he remained firm in his prediction, emphasizing that global liquidity cycles still influence market movements regardless of macroeconomic developments or regulatory advancements.

Tony Severino anticipates a rapid rise to $13, citing technical breakout patterns and referencing the pace of XRP’s movement in previous bull markets. He believes this upward move could occur within a matter of weeks. Market analyst CasiTrades initially set a near-term target range of $6.50 to $8 for July. However, if the current market momentum continues, she believes XRP could reach as high as $26 before the end of the year. Another analyst, EGRAG, analyzed historical data and predicted a likely average peak around $20. He also noted that if XRP follows its 2017 trajectory, the price could extend to as much as $33. His overall forecast places the likely range for a cycle top between $7 and $21. Meanwhile, Ripple Van Wickle estimates that XRP could reach approximately $14 if Bitcoin climbs to $140,000. In a similar vein, Armando Pantoja expects XRP to achieve a maximum value of $25 over the next two years . He also dismissed common concerns about the asset’s market capitalization becoming a limiting factor. While many analysts agree on a bullish outlook for XRP, opinions diverge on how the asset will behave after reaching its peak. Some believe the market will follow familiar correction patterns, while others argue that structural changes in the crypto space may lead to a new market dynamic.

The company will use a private investment in public equity (PIPE) model. The project aims to legitimize Toncoin ownership via public markets. The Ton Foundation and investment firm Kingsway Capital Partners are working to launch a treasury company, according to Bloomberg. The initiative will focus on custodial services for Toncoin, with an initial investment target of $400 million. According to informed sources, the company will use a private investment in public equity (PIPE) structure, in which a public company issues shares to a select group of private investors. One of the investors will be Kingsway, headed by Manuel Stotz, who also serves as the current president of the Ton Foundation. Neither Stotz nor representatives from the foundation commented at the time of publication. The project is receiving financial backing from Cohen & Co, which previously helped organize a $1.5 billion structure linked to Ethereum. Cantor Fitzgerald, a leading company in establishing public crypto holdings, has also shown interest in the project. Increased interest in such initiatives is due to the success of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), founded by Michael Saylor, which invested heavily in Bitcoin and saw its shares jump over 3,400% in five years. More than 100 entities have since developed models to own crypto assets via the stock market. The new Ton Foundation project aims to follow this model by concentrating assets in Toncoin for institutional investment. Although TON is formally separate from Telegram, its price remains sensitive to news about the messaging platform and its founder, Pavel Durov. At the time of publication, Toncoin is ranked 21st among crypto assets by market capitalization, at $7.7 billion, having declined nearly 40% since the start of the year while Bitcoin has surged alongside Telegram’s continued expansion.

2025-07-26 00:00:54+00:00,"Ethereum Validator Exit Queue Explodes To 521,000 ETH ATH, What This Means","Ethereum staking validator Everstake has announced that the validator exit queue has reached its highest point in one year. The expert further explained why this development might be a positive for the ETH ecosystem . Ethereum Validator Exit Queue Reaches New High In an X post , Everstake stated that the Ethereum validator exit queue has reached its highest level in over a year, representing approximately 520,000 ETH, which is equivalent to $1.9 billion at current prices. The validator noted that this queue will take around 19 days to fully clear. He further explained that this exit queue tracks how many validators are leaving Ethereum’s staking system . This typically raises concerns about a huge sell-off being imminent from these validators. However, Everstake assured that the surge in the validator queue is not a sign of fear or collapse. Instead, the expert claimed that it is a shift, whereby these validators are more likely to exit and restake, optimize, or rotate operators than leave the ETH ecosystem. Meanwhile, Everstake admitted that there is still the possibility that these validators may want to lock in profits, especially seeing as the Ethereum price just recently surged to a six-month high. He noted that it is natural to assume that some stakers are preparing to sell, which could create short-term sell pressure and potentially cause ETH to correct. However, on the other hand, the validator remarked that Ethereum is seeing record ETF demand, with billions of dollars in net flows since the beginning of this month. As such, BlackRock, Fidelity, and other ETH ETF issuers could match this potential sell pressure with similar buying pressure. Everstake also declared that this development with the validator exit queue is a “sign of health” and the freedom to move. He claimed that activity like this shows how mature ETH staking has become, with the protocol doing what it was designed to do. He added that this is what decentralization looks like. ETH ETFs Record Inflows For 15 Consecutive Days SoSo Value data shows that the Ethereum ETFs have now recorded 15 consecutive days of net inflows. This follows the net inflow of $231.23 million that they recorded on July 24. These funds currently hold $20.70 billion in net assets, representing 4.59% of Ethereum’s market capitalization . The significant inflows into these funds support Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s theory that ETH will soon witness a demand shock.

Ethereum staking validator Everstake has announced that the validator exit queue has reached its highest point in one year. The expert further explained why this development might be a positive for the ETH ecosystem . Ethereum Validator Exit Queue Reaches New High In an X post , Everstake stated that the Ethereum validator exit queue has reached its highest level in over a year, representing approximately 520,000 ETH, which is equivalent to $1.9 billion at current prices. The validator noted that this queue will take around 19 days to fully clear. He further explained that this exit queue tracks how many validators are leaving Ethereum’s staking system . This typically raises concerns about a huge sell-off being imminent from these validators. However, Everstake assured that the surge in the validator queue is not a sign of fear or collapse. Instead, the expert claimed that it is a shift, whereby these validators are more likely to exit and restake, optimize, or rotate operators than leave the ETH ecosystem. Meanwhile, Everstake admitted that there is still the possibility that these validators may want to lock in profits, especially seeing as the Ethereum price just recently surged to a six-month high. He noted that it is natural to assume that some stakers are preparing to sell, which could create short-term sell pressure and potentially cause ETH to correct. However, on the other hand, the validator remarked that Ethereum is seeing record ETF demand, with billions of dollars in net flows since the beginning of this month. As such, BlackRock, Fidelity, and other ETH ETF issuers could match this potential sell pressure with similar buying pressure. Everstake also declared that this development with the validator exit queue is a “sign of health” and the freedom to move. He claimed that activity like this shows how mature ETH staking has become, with the protocol doing what it was designed to do. He added that this is what decentralization looks like. ETH ETFs Record Inflows For 15 Consecutive Days SoSo Value data shows that the Ethereum ETFs have now recorded 15 consecutive days of net inflows. This follows the net inflow of $231.23 million that they recorded on July 24. These funds currently hold $20.70 billion in net assets, representing 4.59% of Ethereum’s market capitalization . The significant inflows into these funds support Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan’s theory that ETH will soon witness a demand shock. He stated that this demand will come from the ETFs and corporate treasuries, predicting that they could purchase up to $20 billion of ETH in the next year. At the time of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at around $3,630, up over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap."

2025-07-26 00:25:10+00:00,Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding the Market’s ‘Greed’ Zone at 72,"BitcoinWorld Crypto Fear & Greed Index: Decoding the Market’s ‘Greed’ Zone at 72 Are you tracking the pulse of the cryptocurrency market? The latest update from the software development platform Alternative reveals a significant shift: the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed to a notable 72 as of July 26th. This places the market firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, a two-point increase from the previous day, signaling a prevailing positive sentiment despite underlying market dynamics. But what does this really mean for you, the investor, and the broader crypto landscape? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does 72 Signify? In the often-turbulent world of cryptocurrencies, emotions can run high, significantly influencing market movements. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a vital barometer, designed to measure these very emotions. Ranging from 0 to 100, it provides a snapshot of the prevailing sentiment among crypto investors. A score of 0 indicates ‘Extreme Fear,’ suggesting that investors are overly worried, potentially leading to panic selling. Conversely, a score of 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed,’ indicating that the market is overbought and perhaps due for a correction, driven by irrational exuberance. The recent rise to 72, firmly within the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests a widespread optimism. This isn’t just a fleeting feeling; it points to strong buying pressure, increased market activity, and a general belief among participants that prices will continue to rise. Historically, periods of extreme greed have often preceded market pullbacks, as irrational exuberance can lead to unsustainable price bubbles. However, it can also reflect genuine bullish momentum driven by positive developments and increasing adoption. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for making informed decisions, rather than being swept away by the prevailing sentiment. Decoding the Market’s Mood: The Six Pillars of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index The power of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index lies in its multi-faceted approach. It doesn’t rely on a single metric but aggregates data from six key factors, each weighted differently, to paint a comprehensive picture of market sentiment. This holistic view helps to provide a more accurate reflection than any single indicator could offer. Let’s break down these pillars: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, as investors become nervous about sharp price swings. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it with average values. High buying volumes and strong positive momentum often indicate a greedy market, as more money flows in. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms, particularly Twitter, for specific crypto-related hashtags. A rapid increase in post volume and positive sentiment often points towards growing excitement and potential greed. Surveys (15%): While currently paused, this component traditionally gathered investor sentiment through weekly polls. These surveys directly gauged whether investors felt the market was bullish or bearish, providing a direct insight into their psychological state. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes indicate fear, as investors might be shifting away from altcoins into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, a decreasing dominance can suggest growing confidence in altcoins, potentially indicating greed. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies, this factor gauges public interest. A surge in search terms like ‘Bitcoin price manipulation’ or ‘crypto crash’ might signal fear, while searches for ‘buy Bitcoin’ or ‘best altcoins to buy’ could indicate greed. The temporary pausing of the surveys component means the index is currently relying on the other five factors, which still provide a robust assessment of the market’s emotional state. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: Opportunities and Risks for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index sits comfortably in the ‘Greed’ zone, it presents a double-edged sword for investors. On one hand, it signals strong market confidence and potentially continued upward price momentum. This can be an exciting time for those holding assets, as their portfolios may see significant gains. The prevailing optimism can attract new capital, further fueling rallies. However, the ‘Greed’ zone also carries inherent risks. History has shown that periods of extreme greed can lead to irrational behavior, such as: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Investors might rush into assets without proper research, driven by the fear of missing out on quick profits.

2025-07-26 00:30:45+00:00,5 Crypto Gems Set to 1000x This Altcoin Season as Ethereum Climbs to New All-Time High,"As Bitcoin continues its ascent toward a new all-time high (ATH), the altcoin market is experiencing renewed interest. Investors are increasingly turning to presale opportunities in search of the next major breakout token. With Bitcoin trading above $120,000 and altcoin dominance rising, momentum is building behind early-stage crypto presale projects with strong fundamentals and narrative appeal. Among the best crypto presale contenders, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting significant attention. The politically themed decentralized token has millions in its ongoing presale and is positioning itself as one of the most promising altcoins of the current market cycle. Bitcoin’s Surge Rekindles the Presale Narrative Bitcoin is retesting its all-time high of $123,000 following a rally that pushed the price above $120,000. The exponential moving averages are stacked below the current price, indicating strong bullish momentum. The 20-day EMA, now at $118,600, is acting as dynamic support. Both on-chain and derivatives data remain bullish. Futures open interest has risen 2% to $87 billion, while options volume has surged past $110 billion. On Binance, trader sentiment is skewed heavily long, with a long-to-short ratio of 1.87. Bitcoin’s weekly chart reveals an inverse head and shoulders pattern, with projected upside targets ranging from $135,000 to $140,000. While large-cap assets tend to lead during the early stages of a bull market, historical trends suggest that presales and lower-cap tokens often deliver the highest returns as capital begins rotating further out on the risk curve. As Bitcoin’s dominance starts to decline, investors are increasingly exploring tokens with higher upside potential, and one of the favored altcoins is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Best Crypto Presale to Buy: MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE blends political meme culture with real decentralized architecture. Interestingly, it’s riding the meme wave and building infrastructure, community, and trust. Key strengths include: Audit-certified: Smart contracts audited by CertiK and HashEx Tokenomics: Fixed supply of 170 billion tokens, no central wallet or VC allocations Growing community: Over 6,464 unique wallet addresses, with new additions daily Unlike typical meme coins, this crypto presale has a roadmap focused on utility and long-term growth. Its politically charged narrative taps into a niche but passionate user base, comparable to early SHIBA INU and Dogecoin, but with better structure and decentralization. Analysts Predict 1000x Potential for This Crypto Presale Crypto analysts and newsletters have increasingly spotlighted MAGACOIN, with mentions tripling in the last month. Many predict a potential 1000x return based on the current presale price and projected post-launch demand. This bullish outlook is not based on hype alone. MAGACOIN’s development team has already integrated major wallet support (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet) and is laying the groundwork for CEX listings and staking. While many meme tokens see short-lived pumps, MAGACOIN is working toward sustained relevance through transparency, utility, and community-led governance. Final Call: A Time-Sensitive Opportunity With MAGACOIN FINANCE now in its final presale stage, investors have a closing window to secure discounted tokens before the price increases. As altcoin season heats up and Bitcoin approaches new highs, early entries into high-upside crypto presales could yield exponential returns. For those seeking the next breakout altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a unique blend of narrative strength and technical legitimacy.

2025-07-26 01:00:12+00:00,Altcoin Season: Unpacking the Current Bitcoin Dominance,"BitcoinWorld Altcoin Season: Unpacking the Current Bitcoin Dominance Are you wondering whether your portfolio should be stacked with Bitcoin or diversified into a basket of altcoins? The ever-shifting dynamics of the cryptocurrency market often leave investors pondering the optimal strategy. A key indicator in this quest is the Altcoin Season Index, a widely tracked metric that offers valuable insights into the prevailing market sentiment and performance trends. As of 00:39 UTC on July 26, the Altcoin Season Index, as reported by CoinMarketCap (CMC), registered a score of 43, marking a six-point increase from the previous day’s figure. This specific reading unequivocally signals that the market is currently immersed in what is known as ‘Bitcoin Season’. But what does this truly mean for you, and how should you navigate these waters? Let’s unpack the intricacies of the Altcoin Season and its implications. What Exactly is the Altcoin Season Index (ASI) and How Does It Work? The Altcoin Season Index (ASI) is a crucial metric developed and tracked by leading cryptocurrency price data platform, CoinMarketCap (CMC). It serves as a barometer for the broader crypto market, indicating whether altcoins are collectively outperforming Bitcoin, or vice-versa. Understanding this index is fundamental for any investor looking to optimize their crypto strategy. Here’s how the Altcoin Season Index operates: Scope of Measurement: The index rigorously compares the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap over a 90-day period. It’s important to note that stablecoins (like USDT or USDC) and wrapped tokens (like wBTC) are specifically excluded from this calculation to provide a clearer picture of speculative asset performance. Defining Altcoin Season: For the market to be officially declared in ‘Altcoin Season’, a significant majority of these top 100 altcoins must demonstrate superior performance against Bitcoin. Specifically, at least 75% of these selected altcoins need to have outperformed Bitcoin over the preceding 90 days. When this threshold is met, the index typically registers a higher score, moving towards 100. Defining Bitcoin Season: Conversely, ‘Bitcoin Season’ is declared when Bitcoin’s dominance is evident. This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. A lower index score, moving towards 1, signifies Bitcoin Season. Score Range: The Altcoin Season Index scores range from 1 to 100, providing a clear visual representation of the market’s current state. A score of 43, as we see now, clearly falls within the Bitcoin Season range, indicating that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer over the last three months. This metric is invaluable because it helps investors gauge where the ‘smart money’ might be flowing and whether it’s a period to prioritize Bitcoin holdings or explore opportunities within the broader altcoin ecosystem. Why Are We Currently Experiencing Bitcoin Season? The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 43 isn’t just a random number; it reflects underlying market dynamics that favor Bitcoin. Several factors typically contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance and lead to a ‘Bitcoin Season’. Understanding these can help investors anticipate future shifts and make informed decisions. Here are some key reasons why Bitcoin often takes the lead: Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty, economic instability, or geopolitical tensions, investors often flock to Bitcoin. It’s perceived as the ‘digital gold’ or a safer haven compared to the more volatile and speculative altcoins. Its larger market capitalization and established infrastructure make it a more reliable store of value in turbulent times. Macroeconomic Headwinds: High inflation, rising interest rates, or broader economic downturns can lead to a general de-risking in financial markets. Cryptocurrency, being a high-risk asset class, often sees capital flow out of smaller, less liquid altcoins and into the more robust Bitcoin. Pre-Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s halving events, which occur approximately every four years, often precede significant price rallies. In the months leading up to a halving, there’s typically increased investor interest and accumulation of Bitcoin, leading to its outperformance. This pre-halving accumulation phase can often trigger a Bitcoin Season. Institutional Adoption and ETF Approvals: Major institutional interest, such as the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in various jurisdictions, funnels substantial capital directly into Bitcoin. This institutional demand can significantly boost Bitcoin’s price and market dominance, leaving altcoins relatively behind. Market Liquidity Consolidation: During periods of lower overall market liquidity, capital tends to consolidate into the most liquid assets. Bitcoin, with its vast trading volumes and deep order books, naturally attracts this liquidity, further strengthening its position.

This occurs when 25% or fewer of the top 100 altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin over the same 90-day period. A lower index score, moving towards 1, signifies Bitcoin Season. Score Range: The Altcoin Season Index scores range from 1 to 100, providing a clear visual representation of the market’s current state. A score of 43, as we see now, clearly falls within the Bitcoin Season range, indicating that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer over the last three months. This metric is invaluable because it helps investors gauge where the ‘smart money’ might be flowing and whether it’s a period to prioritize Bitcoin holdings or explore opportunities within the broader altcoin ecosystem. Why Are We Currently Experiencing Bitcoin Season? The current Altcoin Season Index reading of 43 isn’t just a random number; it reflects underlying market dynamics that favor Bitcoin. Several factors typically contribute to Bitcoin’s dominance and lead to a ‘Bitcoin Season’. Understanding these can help investors anticipate future shifts and make informed decisions. Here are some key reasons why Bitcoin often takes the lead: Flight to Safety: In times of market uncertainty, economic instability, or geopolitical tensions, investors often flock to Bitcoin. It’s perceived as the ‘digital gold’ or a safer haven compared to the more volatile and speculative altcoins. Its larger market capitalization and established infrastructure make it a more reliable store of value in turbulent times. Macroeconomic Headwinds: High inflation, rising interest rates, or broader economic downturns can lead to a general de-risking in financial markets. Cryptocurrency, being a high-risk asset class, often sees capital flow out of smaller, less liquid altcoins and into the more robust Bitcoin. Pre-Halving Cycles: Bitcoin’s halving events, which occur approximately every four years, often precede significant price rallies. In the months leading up to a halving, there’s typically increased investor interest and accumulation of Bitcoin, leading to its outperformance. This pre-halving accumulation phase can often trigger a Bitcoin Season. Institutional Adoption and ETF Approvals: Major institutional interest, such as the approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs in various jurisdictions, funnels substantial capital directly into Bitcoin. This institutional demand can significantly boost Bitcoin’s price and market dominance, leaving altcoins relatively behind. Market Liquidity Consolidation: During periods of lower overall market liquidity, capital tends to consolidate into the most liquid assets. Bitcoin, with its vast trading volumes and deep order books, naturally attracts this liquidity, further strengthening its position. The current score of"

2025-07-26 02:34:49+00:00,CleanSpark: Benefiting From Bitcoin Surge,"Summary CleanSpark offers a compelling small-cap opportunity, combining undervaluation with direct exposure to rising Bitcoin prices and a significant Bitcoin treasury. Operationally, CleanSpark has boosted its hash rate above 50 EH/s and shifted to a ''produce and sell'' Bitcoin strategy, enhancing liquidity and decoupling somewhat from Bitcoin price swings. Rising energy costs and lack of transparency on mining costs present risks, but higher Bitcoin prices currently offset these pressures, supporting strong margins. Despite inherent volatility and risks, CleanSpark trades at an attractive valuation, remains profitable across various Bitcoin price scenarios, and I maintain a buy rating. Amid a sky-high stock market, I continue to believe that investors have to rotate more and more of our portfolios to lesser-known names in order to beat the major indices. For me, that means increasing my exposure to small-caps. CleanSpark ( CLSK ), in my view, is an excellent company that gives exposure to both an undervalued small-cap name plus rising Bitcoin prices. One of the most prominent Bitcoin miners in the U.S., half of CleanSpark''s value alone sits in its current Bitcoin treasury, while the company continues to add to its hash rate to increase Bitcoin production. Year to date, shares of CleanSpark have jumped ~25% - roughly mirroring the rise in Bitcoin. And yet, in my view the stock still remains quite undervalued. Data by YCharts I last wrote a buy opinion on CleanSpark in April, when the stock was trading near $9 per share. Since then, CleanSpark has boosted its operational throughput while also adopting a strategy of selling more Bitcoin, to take advantage of higher prices and to ensure more consistent liquidity flow. I remain at a buy rating here, though I''m cognizant of several new risks that have emerged. Hash rate boost, increased selling Let''s now start with the positive news that CleanSpark has to report. As a reminder for investors who are newer to this name, the company reports the results of its Bitcoin mining operations every month. In July, the company reported mining results for the month of June, in which CleanSpark crossed a significant threshold: exceeding a hash rate of 50 EH/s for the first time, which was its stated goal for the mid year. Meanwhile, during the month of June, the company produced 685 Bitcoin - on an annualized basis, this would equate to ~8,200 bitcoins produced annually. CleanSpark June mining results (CleanSpark July press release) But perhaps the most significant operational strategy change for CleanSpark is the fact that the company is now actively looking to sell more Bitcoin, rather than holding the majority of its production for investment. This is a fantastic way for CleanSpark to benefit from Bitcoin''s meteoric rise this year (at the time of writing, up 25% to ~$118k since the start of January). The company initiated what it calls a ""Digital Asset Management"" strategy, owned by the company''s treasury team. The goal is to be able to drive spot sales of Bitcoin with ""derivative overlay"" in order to take advantage of rising prices. In June, the company sold 578.5 Bitcoin, or 84% of what it produced. I view the pivot to a ""produce and sell"" strategy as a positive that should help decouple CleanSpark''s value from the price of Bitcoin itself. Today, the company''s Bitcoin treasury represents roughly half of its market cap value - to me, bringing down that treasury unlocks the possibility of buying back shares of reinvesting into additional production capacity. Rising energy costs and less transparency This being said, we do have to be aware of one risk: CleanSpark didn''t report its usual customary ""cost per Bitcoin mined"" in its most recent quarter, only citing that mining costs have increased due to rising energy prices. The company most recently reported $34,000 per coin mined in Q1 (the December quarter), and $36,250 in Q4 (September). We had been hopeful for a falling cost trajectory, but now we know only that Q2''s (March quarter) mining cost was above what it had been in Q1. Per CEO Zach Bradford''s remarks on the Q2 earnings call in May on mining costs and mining difficulty: Average revenue per Bitcoin was up 10.5% quarter over quarter and nearly 69% year over year, while our marginal cost per coin rose, reflecting both increased network difficulty and higher nationwide power prices. We remained focused on margin and long-term performance rather than any single metric. I want to be clear on what that means. That means we do not manage the power prices, and when margins are healthy, we run through slightly elevated power prices, as long as this drives more value to the bottom line. As a result, the average power price printed higher while delivering increased gross profit [...] Mining difficulty rose 3.6% during the quarter, while power costs increased. Yet, thanks to improved fleet efficiency, our gross margin compression nearly matched the difficulty change",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4804723-cleanspark-benefiting-from-bitcoin-surge?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING,CLSK,BTC,"CleanSpark: Benefiting From Bitcoin Surge.

Nowhere is this more apparent than in the world of derivatives, particularly with crypto perpetual futures liquidation events. Over the past 24 hours, the digital asset landscape witnessed a significant shake-up, with hundreds of millions of dollars in leveraged positions wiped out. This isn’t just a statistic; it’s a powerful reminder of the inherent volatility and risks involved in trading perpetual futures. Let’s dive deep into the recent breakdown and understand what these numbers truly mean for traders and the broader market. What Exactly are Crypto Perpetual Futures, and Why Do They Matter? Before we dissect the recent liquidation figures, it’s crucial to grasp the mechanics of crypto perpetual futures . Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, perpetual futures do not. This unique feature allows traders to hold leveraged positions indefinitely, as long as they meet margin requirements. They are incredibly popular because they offer: High Leverage: Traders can control large positions with a relatively small amount of capital. 24/7 Trading: Mirroring the underlying crypto market, perpetual futures trade around the clock. Price Discovery: Their continuous nature makes them key instruments for price discovery in the crypto ecosystem. However, with great power comes great responsibility – and significant risk. The ability to amplify gains also means the potential to amplify losses, making understanding crypto perpetual futures liquidation paramount. Decoding Liquidation: The Trader’s Nightmare So, what exactly is “liquidation” in the context of crypto perpetual futures liquidation ? Simply put, it’s the forced closure of a trader’s leveraged position by an exchange due to a failure to meet margin requirements. When the market moves against a trader’s position, and their margin balance falls below a certain threshold (the maintenance margin), the exchange automatically liquidates the position to prevent further losses to the trader and the exchange itself. This often happens rapidly and can result in the loss of the entire initial margin. Key factors leading to liquidation include: Volatile Price Swings: Sudden, sharp movements in the underlying asset’s price. High Leverage: The higher the leverage, the smaller the price movement required to trigger liquidation. Insufficient Margin: Not having enough collateral to cover potential losses. The term “long liquidation” means that positions betting on price increases (longs) were closed out, typically because the price fell. Conversely, “short liquidation” occurs when prices rise, forcing positions betting on price decreases (shorts) to close. The Dramatic 24-Hour Breakdown: Who Got Hit and Why? The past 24 hours painted a vivid picture of market volatility, with significant crypto perpetual futures liquidation impacting major assets. Here’s a closer look at the data: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (USD) Percentage Long Liquidated Bitcoin (BTC) $147.42 million 79.09% Ethereum (ETH) $106.23 million 53.93% Solana (SOL) $28.21 million 65.55% This data reveals a clear trend: a significant majority of the liquidated positions were “longs.” This indicates a prevailing downward price movement across these assets that caught many bullish traders off guard. For Bitcoin, nearly 80% of the liquidated value came from long positions, suggesting a strong price correction or bearish momentum that overwhelmed leveraged BTC longs. Ethereum also saw substantial long liquidations, though slightly less pronounced than BTC, while Solana experienced considerable long pressure as well. Such concentrated long liquidations can create a “cascade effect.” As one position is liquidated, it adds selling pressure to the market, which can then trigger more liquidations, leading to further price drops. This domino effect is a critical aspect of understanding large-scale crypto perpetual futures liquidation events. Why Do These Liquidation Numbers Matter to You? Beyond the raw figures, understanding crypto perpetual futures liquidation data offers invaluable insights for all market participants, not just those actively trading derivatives: Market Sentiment Indicator: High long liquidations often signal bearish sentiment or a market correction. Conversely, high short liquidations can precede a rally. Volatility Gauge: Large liquidation sums highlight periods of extreme market volatility, indicating increased risk. Understanding Market Structure: It reveals where significant leverage is concentrated and thus where potential vulnerabilities lie.

With rising uncertainty in major economies due to various political and macroeconomic conditions, BTC remains a “safer” alternative, at least for now. Another Player in The Game An AI-focused firm headquartered in Japan, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Quantum Solutions Co., is the latest addition to public companies that have adopted the Bitcoin treasury model. In the shared press release, it outlined an initial plan to raise $10 million (¥1.48 billion) for purchasing the asset, with the ultimate goal of accumulating a maximum of 3,000 BTC over the next 12 months. The board of directors meeting had decreed that a subsidiary of the enterprise would launch a new business focused on crypto investments. The company is currently assessing how the investment can potentially impact its finances for the fiscal year ending in February 2026, so the exact method of acquiring the capital has not been decided yet. The firm further stated in the news release: Amidst ongoing yen depreciation and increasing international financial uncertainty, the investment and holding of Bitcoin are gaining importance among global listed companies and institutional investors as a means of diversifying assets, mitigating currency risks, and hedging against inflation. The investment business will be promoted under a few key policies: Purchase and holding of Bitcoin for long-term value Phases of implementation will be in place for the acquisition volume and holding ratio, with constant monitoring Countermeasures for price fluctuation risk and cybersecurity, encompassing a risk management strategy Economic Conditions in Japan and The Trade Deal The shift in sentiment and adoption of Bitcoin by numerous companies comes at a time of financial instability and a crashing bond market in Japan.

The leading cryptocurrency asset has remained a strong contender for different companies’ treasury strategy, now recognized globally within the corporate world. With rising uncertainty in major economies due to various political and macroeconomic conditions, BTC remains a “safer” alternative, at least for now. Another Player in The Game An AI-focused firm headquartered in Japan, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Quantum Solutions Co., is the latest addition to public companies that have adopted the Bitcoin treasury model. In the shared press release, it outlined an initial plan to raise $10 million (¥1.48 billion) for purchasing the asset, with the ultimate goal of accumulating a maximum of 3,000 BTC over the next 12 months. The board of directors meeting had decreed that a subsidiary of the enterprise would launch a new business focused on crypto investments. The company is currently assessing how the investment can potentially impact its finances for the fiscal year ending in February 2026, so the exact method of acquiring the capital has not been decided yet. The firm further stated in the news release: Amidst ongoing yen depreciation and increasing international financial uncertainty, the investment and holding of Bitcoin are gaining importance among global listed companies and institutional investors as a means of diversifying assets, mitigating currency risks, and hedging against inflation. The investment business will be promoted under a few key policies: Purchase and holding of Bitcoin for long-term value Phases of implementation will be in place for the acquisition volume and holding ratio, with constant monitoring Countermeasures for price fluctuation risk and cybersecurity, encompassing a risk management strategy Economic Conditions in Japan and The Trade Deal The shift in sentiment and adoption of Bitcoin by numerous companies comes at a time of financial instability and a crashing bond market in Japan.

2025-07-26 03:40:07+00:00,Founders Must Be the Signal Amid Web 3.0 Noise,"HodlX Guest Post Submit Your Post Recycled buzzwords and hashtags are not enough in the modern Web 3.0 market. If you want to break through in today’s Web 3.0 space, the only way to do that is by creating a monopoly in something consumers want. Very few times has this been done in blockchain. Bitcoin stands as a new asset class, while Ethereum has proven viable for creating mainly NFTs (non-fungible tokens). There is a class of blockchain firms serving traditional financial markets as well as experimenting with stablecoins, RWAs (real-world assets) and more. And while these innovations may make a global impact, they will be dominated by a few players. That is becoming clearer, especially as Web 3.0 takes a backseat to AI. At this point in Web 3.0’s evolution, nobody cares about your whitepaper, roadmap, tokenomics or governance model. It’s no longer 2016. You’re not going to build the next unicorn through hashtags and recycled ideas. Your minute on-chain metrics are meaningless in the grand scheme of all things crypto. All it shows is a lack of adoption and a lack of product market fit, or in other words, value. As a Web 3.0 founder, your survival depends on the uniqueness of your project. You must understand and clearly explain what makes both you and your project not just special but truly one-of-a-kind. Your individuality, as well as that of your company, is your biggest strength. Remember this important truth. The best way to make your project unique entails carving out a monopoly in a niche that solves a big problem. If you find yourself leaning into jargon, perhaps your idea serves no purpose. Perhaps not even you know what it is you are attempting to do. It could be merely that the timing is wrong. Either way, your project must have tangible benefits for consumers and deliver it at least 10 times better than the next best. Ask yourself this question: Is your company story just a rehash of the same old buzzwords Web 3.0 has been throwing around now for more than a decade? If so, you might find resistance gaining traction as you share your story on X and LinkedIn. People have heard it all before. Are you highlighting the correct parts of your expertise and real-world experience? Are your product launches and milestones solving problems for consumers, or are they announcements for the sake of announcements? Avoid those. If your consumer can’t experience an announcement for themselves, don’t bother with the public relations aspect. Save that for when you have something that can improve people’s lives. While you are free to publish insights and case studies on your project, they should be hyper-focused on the unique aspects of your project. Don’t write whitepapers that are not focused on your core strengths and your mission. What does your team do better than any other team in the Web 3.0 space? All of your team’s energy should go towards this strength. Generally speaking, avoid side quests in business. Many founders grow bored with their initial vision, start a side quest, get spread too thin and run out of business. Stay focused on building a monopoly within Web 3.0. Many Web 3.0 companies put too much energy into incestuous partnerships with other Web 3.0 companies, with minimal innovation. Instead, you must look towards large corporations for partnerships that will impact your business in the way you want. Instead of focusing on partnerships with Web 3.0 companies, focus on partnerships with companies outside the space, like from the red-hot AI industry. These are the partnerships you should be announcing on social media, not partnerships with other early-stage Web 3.0 companies. This doesn’t mean you should not attend hackathons and Web 3.0 conferences, but perhaps the purpose there will be to tap into consumers, not partners. When you do speak at conferences, do you offer a unique perspective compared with the rest of the speakers and panelists, or are you repeating views of the industry that have been flogged to death already? Again, you must consider what makes your view or work in the industry unique and lean into that and only that. When you speak before an audience, take risks. Make your wildest claims, assuming they’re backed by logic and reason. Instead of posting into the void on social media – or cross-promoting projects for joint marketing campaigns, AMAs (ask me anything) and more – reach out to the largest technology journals in the world, including Reuters, Associated Press, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, TechCrunch and others. Reach out to the largest publications in your region. You may not hear back, but these are the publications with the readers you want to know your name. Offer them your insights on timely technology news stories. Don’t chase every opportunity.

2025-07-26 04:00:49+00:00,"Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano Surge—Analysts Forecast 16x Expansion as New Listings Accelerate Adoption","As bullish sentiment returns to the crypto market, Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano (ADA) are leading the charge. With regulatory clarity and increased institutional flows, analysts are forecasting a potential 16x market expansion by the end of 2025. But among these heavyweights, one early-stage altcoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE, is catching attention for its strong fundamentals, ideological edge, and rapidly closing presale window. Bitcoin Eyes Breakout as Bulls Target $123K+ Bitcoin continues to display a bullish structure on all major timeframes. The flagship cryptocurrency recently surged past $123,000 before consolidating around the $116,000 to $120,000 range. A high-volume bearish candle indicates mild profit-taking, but the pattern of higher highs and higher lows remains intact. Support is holding firm at $115,000, while the next upside target remains at $123,000 and beyond. If volume supports a breakout above $120,000, analysts believe a retest of all-time highs could follow quickly. Specifically, veteran market watcher Peter Brandt has said $150,000 could be the next stop for Bitcoin as early as August. Solana Gains Institutional Traction: $337 in Sight Solana is increasingly seen as a credible Ethereum alternative, offering blazing speed and ultra-low transaction costs thanks to its hybrid Proof of Stake and Proof of History architecture. According to a report by 21Shares, analysts predict that SOL could rally from $178 to $337, representing an 89% upside. Institutional investors are also warming up to Solana due to its business-oriented ecosystem and community pragmatism. This was evident in the 2025 memecoin boom, which boosted network activity and volume. While critics highlight the platform’s history of outages and centralization risks, many investors are willing to trade those concerns for speed, usability, and scalability. Cardano Clears Resistance, Eyes Set on $0.90 Cardano (ADA) is flashing strong bullish signals after a 17% rally last week. Currently trading above $0.82, ADA has broken through key long-term resistance levels. ADA recently peaked at $0.89, marking a 20-week high and placing it #3 on Grayscale’s top-performing crypto list as of July 17. With a 681% year-to-date gain, it has outpaced competitors like Solana and Tron, fueled by regulatory tailwinds and increasing institutional inflows. Analysts believe ADA could rally to $3, though some caution is warranted given market volatility. Now ranked #10 by market cap, Cardano’s decentralized governance model and bullish sentiment may support further upside. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin with a Movement While Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano attract institutional capital, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as a breakout altcoin with a compelling narrative. Once seen as just a politically charged meme, it’s now making its way onto analyst watchlists alongside established crypto names. Backed by CertiK and HashEx audits, MAGACOIN offers 100% decentralized ownership and a capped supply, echoing the early days of Dogecoin and Solana. Its growing community on Telegram and X (Twitter) is driving momentum, with analysts projecting up to 16x returns, especially for early buyers who benefit from staking bonuses and governance rights as the final presale stage wraps up. Conclusion: Utility and Narrative Drive the Next Crypto Cycle With crypto entering a fresh growth phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. While Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano lead the charge, this community-driven altcoin blends ideology and decentralization for serious upside potential. As new listings accelerate and momentum builds, early-stage opportunities like this are disappearing fast. MAGACOIN FINANCE may be one of the year’s breakout plays.

MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Meme Coin with a Movement While Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano attract institutional capital, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as a breakout altcoin with a compelling narrative. Once seen as just a politically charged meme, it’s now making its way onto analyst watchlists alongside established crypto names. Backed by CertiK and HashEx audits, MAGACOIN offers 100% decentralized ownership and a capped supply, echoing the early days of Dogecoin and Solana. Its growing community on Telegram and X (Twitter) is driving momentum, with analysts projecting up to 16x returns, especially for early buyers who benefit from staking bonuses and governance rights as the final presale stage wraps up. Conclusion: Utility and Narrative Drive the Next Crypto Cycle With crypto entering a fresh growth phase, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out. While Bitcoin, Solana, and Cardano lead the charge, this community-driven altcoin blends ideology and decentralization for serious upside potential.

If approved, everyday investors in the UK would be able to trade cETNs, regulated products that give exposure to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, through official trading platforms. This move comes as global interest in crypto investment products continues to grow.

ETFs avoid self-custody risks, often have lower fees, and are already widely used in traditional finance. Firms like 21Shares and Coinbase UK echoed that sentiment, urging regulators to go beyond cETNs.

2025-07-26 05:21:06+00:00,"Bitcoin Is “Freedom Money” and  “Lifeline for Americans,” Says U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis","The post Bitcoin Is “Freedom Money” and “Lifeline for Americans,” Says U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis has called Bitcoin “freedom money,” praising it as a hedge against inflation and a tool for financial independence. Her remarks come amid growing interest in Bitcoin as a stable store of value, especially during times of economic turbulence. Bitcoin as a Lifeline in Tough Times Appearing on Fox Business , Senator Lummis explained that Bitcoin offers Americans a safeguard against the erosion of the U.S. dollar. With inflation weighing down purchasing power, she positioned Bitcoin as a transparent, decentralized alternative that empowers individuals to regain control over their finances. The key appeal, she says, lies in Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins, which contrasts with the unlimited printing of fiat currency. Lummis stressed that Bitcoin doesn’t rely on central banks or government control, making it attractive to those wary of traditional monetary policy. As inflation rises and uncertainty spreads, she believes more people will turn to Bitcoin as a form of financial shelter. Pushing Crypto Policy in Washington Lummis continues to lead crypto-friendly efforts in Congress. She’s actively advocating for legislation that supports the use of digital assets, including a proposed tax bill that removes double taxation on Bitcoin transactions and adds a de minimis exception for purchases under $300. Her broader ambition includes the BITCOIN Act, which would mandate the U.S. government to acquire up to 1 million BTC over five years. The upcoming White House crypto policy report, due July 30, is expected to reference her initiatives as progress toward establishing a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Crypto Reaction At the time of her comments, Bitcoin was trading around $116,609, down 1.67% on the day, but showing strength in volume with over $104 billion traded in 24 hours, a sign that interest remains strong despite price fluctuations.

Remember Warren Buffett’s wisdom about investing – buy when others are fearful and sell when they are greedy? This narrative has been particularly impactful in the cryptocurrency market, where greed and fear often dominate investors’ thoughts. Santiment has also been a massive proponent of the thesis, and the company’s latest post highlights the recent changes in investors’ behavior. According to the overall social dominance, it determined that BTC and XRP have dropped out of the greed zone, even though both registered new all-time highs just last week and are currently trading close below them. This is mostly because BTC dumped from over $123,000 to under $115,000, while XRP slipped from $3.65 to just below $3. However, Santiment said markets tend to move in the opposite direction of what the crowd expects, which “actually makes BTC and XRP buy-low candidates.” While Bitcoin & XRP are seeing low greed levels, Ethereum’s +147% gains since early April still has traders bullish.

It aims to become the first publicly traded U.S. Healthcare company to hold XRP as part of its financial reserves. Earlier in May, the company had secured a $50 million Equity Line of Credit (ELOC) from LDA Capital to support its XRP adoption plans. Wellgistics plans to issue debt securities or raise capital in other ways to gradually expand its XRP holdings. Beyond Treasury, Is This Real Business Utility? It also plans to integrate blockchain-based payment systems by leveraging the XRPL. A key part of this strategy is using XRP as collateral for loans to improve the company’s financial stability. Attorney Bill Morgan notes that Wellgistics Health’s recent SEC filing is not just about holding XRP as a treasury reserve. The company’s plan reveals a multi-dimensional strategy that puts XRP to serious use in its business operations. It plans to use XRP for real-time payments with pharmacies and vendors via the XRPL, showing true business utility. It will also raise capital to buy more XRP, use it as collateral in deals, and even generate income from its holdings. However, Wellgistics’ plan to use XRP has people asking if it’s a real strategy or just a way to get investor attention. Some are asking why a healthcare company like Wellgistics would use XRP, often called the “bankers coin.” Bill Morgan responded, saying it’s exactly the right question to ask. Flipping the XRP Narrative Marc Fagel, a former SEC official, also joined in and pointed out that Wellgistics has low revenue, net losses, few assets, and even a “going concern” warning from its auditor. That raises doubts that could this be more about attracting investors than a real business plan? While Morgan admits that this is possible, he also sees it as part of a bigger trend. Other firms like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Meitu have already used crypto, mainly Bitcoin, for treasury. One user raised a question if Wellgistics chose XRP expecting it to outperform cash like Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy, or is it about using XRP for liquidity in a new payment system. Morgan said that it may likely be both.

2025-07-26 05:55:10+00:00,Bold Move: Volcon Reveals Strategic Bitcoin Holdings of $375 Million,"BitcoinWorld Bold Move: Volcon Reveals Strategic Bitcoin Holdings of $375 Million In a move that has sent ripples across both the automotive and cryptocurrency sectors, Volcon, an innovative all-electric outdoor powersports vehicle manufacturer, recently announced a significant and strategic decision regarding its treasury assets. This isn’t just about a company holding cash; it’s about a pioneering firm embracing the future of finance by integrating substantial Bitcoin holdings into its balance sheet. This announcement isn’t merely a headline; it’s a testament to a growing trend of corporate entities recognizing Bitcoin’s potential as a long-term store of value and a strategic reserve asset. What does this mean for Volcon, for Bitcoin, and for the broader corporate world? Volcon’s Audacious Bet: Unpacking Their Bitcoin Holdings On July 25, Volcon made headlines with a press release on Business Wire, confirming that the company now holds an impressive 3,183.37 BTC, valued at approximately $375 million at the time of the announcement. This isn’t a speculative, short-term play; it’s a calculated long-term investment. The company revealed that these Bitcoin holdings were acquired at an average purchase price of $117,697 per BTC, showcasing a deep conviction in the digital asset’s future trajectory. This substantial investment signals Volcon’s confidence in Bitcoin as more than just a volatile digital currency. It positions Bitcoin as a foundational element of their treasury strategy, aiming to preserve and potentially grow capital in an ever-evolving economic landscape. Such a move by a manufacturing company, especially one in the emerging electric vehicle sector, highlights a significant shift in corporate financial thinking. A Strategic Treasury: How Volcon is Optimizing its Bitcoin Holdings Volcon’s approach to its Bitcoin holdings goes beyond simple accumulation. The company has implemented a sophisticated strategy that includes selling short-term put options. This isn’t a common move for corporate treasury management, and it speaks volumes about their innovative financial foresight. But what exactly does this entail? Earning Premium Income: By selling put options with strike prices between $115,000 and $117,000, Volcon earns premium income. This provides an immediate financial benefit, adding to their overall treasury reserves. Potential for Lower Acquisition Costs: If the price of Bitcoin drops below these strike prices before the options expire, Volcon is obligated to buy more BTC at those pre-agreed lower prices. This mechanism allows them to potentially increase their Bitcoin holdings at a more favorable cost basis, effectively buying the dip. Active Management: This strategy demonstrates an active, rather than passive, management of their digital assets. It’s a nuanced approach that seeks to maximize returns and acquisition opportunities within the volatile crypto market, while also generating additional revenue. Co-CEO Ryan Lane emphasized the firm’s conviction in BTC as a long-term store of value and a key treasury reserve asset. This statement resonates with a growing number of corporate leaders who view Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a superior alternative to traditional fiat currencies, which are subject to devaluation. Why Are Companies Like Volcon Embracing Bitcoin? Volcon isn’t alone in its conviction. The past few years have seen a notable shift, with more and more publicly traded companies, from tech giants to traditional corporations, allocating a portion of their treasury to Bitcoin. But what drives this seemingly unconventional decision? The motivations are multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, is increasingly seen as a robust hedge against currency debasement. Long-Term Store of Value: Proponents argue that Bitcoin’s digital scarcity and global accessibility make it an ideal long-term store of value, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving purchasing power over time. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury diversifies assets beyond traditional cash, bonds, and equities, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing returns. Innovation and Forward-Thinking Image: Companies embracing Bitcoin often project an image of being innovative, tech-savvy, and forward-thinking, which can attract a new generation of investors and talent. Potential for Appreciation: Despite its volatility, Bitcoin has historically shown significant long-term appreciation, offering the potential for substantial capital gains for companies holding it.

2025-07-26 06:00:11+00:00,Explosive U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: $129 Million Inflow Surge Continues,"BitcoinWorld Explosive U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs: $129 Million Inflow Surge Continues The world of digital assets is constantly evolving, and a significant milestone was recently achieved as U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs continued their impressive run. On July 25, these innovative investment vehicles collectively recorded a substantial $129.37 million in net inflows, marking the second consecutive trading day of positive flows. This consistent influx of capital underscores a growing confidence among investors, both institutional and retail, in Bitcoin as a legitimate and accessible asset class. What does this sustained positive momentum mean for the broader cryptocurrency market, and what factors are driving this remarkable surge? The Resounding Success: A Detailed Look at July 25th’s U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows The latest figures, as shared by market observer Trader T on X, paint a clear picture of robust investor interest in U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Leading the charge was BlackRock’s IBIT, which attracted a remarkable $91.50 million in inflows. This performance highlights IBIT’s dominant position and its appeal to a wide range of investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin. Following BlackRock, ARK Invest’s ARKB demonstrated strong demand with $30.27 million in inflows, further solidifying its presence in the competitive ETF landscape. Bitwise’s BITB and VanEck’s HODL also saw significant capital injections, with $20.96 million and $18.16 million, respectively. Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s Mini BTC, a newer entrant, contributed positively with $10.19 million and $8.79 million in inflows, showcasing diversified interest across various fund providers. However, the day wasn’t without its contrasts. Grayscale’s GBTC, a converted trust, recorded an outflow of $50.50 million. This outflow is largely anticipated and understood within the market, as some investors opt to move from the higher-fee trust structure to newer, often lower-fee, spot ETFs. The remaining U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating a stable, albeit not actively trading, segment of the market.

The consistent positive net inflows into U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are far more than just daily financial statistics; they represent a pivotal shift in how Bitcoin is perceived and accessed by mainstream finance. Here’s why these inflows are so significant: Institutional Validation: The participation of major asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity lends immense credibility to Bitcoin. Their ability to attract significant capital indicates that large institutions are increasingly comfortable allocating funds to the cryptocurrency space, viewing it as a viable long-term investment. Increased Accessibility: ETFs provide a regulated, familiar, and easy-to-access investment vehicle for traditional investors. They eliminate the complexities of direct Bitcoin ownership, such as setting up digital wallets or managing private keys, thereby broadening the investor base. Market Liquidity and Stability: Consistent inflows contribute to greater liquidity in the Bitcoin market. As more capital flows in, it can potentially reduce price volatility and create a more stable trading environment, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for risk-averse investors. Supply Shock Dynamics: When ETFs accumulate Bitcoin, they effectively remove a portion of the circulating supply from the open market. If demand from ETFs continues to outpace new supply (especially after halving events), it could exert upward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. Positive Sentiment Indicator: Two consecutive days of net inflows, especially after periods of mixed performance, serve as a strong positive sentiment indicator. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the underlying belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition remains robust. Navigating the Landscape: Key Players in the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF Arena The competition among providers of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs is intense, with each fund vying for market share. Understanding the dynamics of these key players provides valuable insight into the evolving investment landscape. BlackRock’s IBIT Dominance: BlackRock, with its immense global reach and reputation, has quickly established IBIT as a frontrunner. Its substantial inflows reflect investor trust in the firm’s management capabilities and its ability to seamlessly integrate digital assets into traditional portfolios.

This is evidenced by the large buys that have dominated ETH as Ethereum treasury companies become a major player in the space. Amid this, billionaire and CEO of Galaxy Digital Investments, Mike Novogratz, has revealed the important level for Ethereum to beat to enter price discovery. Ethereum Price Needs To Cross $4,000 În an interview with SquawkBox, Novogratz points to the recent strength of Ethereum amid rapid accumulation as a reason for it being a better bet than Bitcoin. The major reason outlined for why ETH was a better bet than BTC at this point is the fact that Ethereum treasury companies are now becoming a staple, with two ETH treasury companies, such as SharpLink and GameSquare Holdings, among others, already established and more on the way. Related Reading: XRP Price Showing Quiet Strength As Next Breakout Level Lies At $4.65 As these companies continue to accumulate ETH, the billionaire explains that with not much supply, the Ethereum price is likely to rise. He also brings up the fact that Ethereum has a very powerful narrative, and the market reaching record short levels has also aided its bullishness. Given these, Novogratz explained that the Ethereum price is at least destined to knock on the $4,000 level a few times. Also, once the altcoin is able to take out $4,000, then the billionaire believes that the ETH price will enter into price discovery, which could drive it higher. As Ethereum continues to look like the better bet, he also believes that the altcoin could end up outperforming the Bitcoin price over the next 3-6 months. This gives a short timeframe, especially as Bitcoin has already hit multiple new all-time highs over the past year, and Ethereum is yet to beat its highs from 2021. ETH Is Already Outperforming Bitcoin So far, in the month of July, the Ethereum price has greatly outperformed that of Bitcoin in terms of gains, lending credence to Novogratz’s expectations that the altcoin will outperform the pioneer cryptocurrency. According to data from CryptoRank, ETH is up more than 45% this month already compared to the less than 8% on record for Bitcoin.

2025-07-26 06:25:11+00:00,Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Canadian Firm Bolsters Holdings to 166 BTC,"BitcoinWorld Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: Canadian Firm Bolsters Holdings to 166 BTC In the dynamic world of digital assets, every significant move by a publicly traded company sends ripples across the market. The recent announcement from Canada-listed Bitcoin Treasury Capital, confirming an additional Bitcoin acquisition of 10 BTC, is one such event that captures the attention of investors and enthusiasts alike. This latest purchase elevates their total holdings to a remarkable 166 BTC, underscoring a deepening commitment to the premier cryptocurrency. But what does this strategic maneuver truly signify for the company, its shareholders, and the broader crypto landscape? What Does This Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Signify? Bitcoin Treasury Capital’s consistent accumulation of Bitcoin is more than just a balance sheet entry; it’s a powerful statement of conviction. In an era where traditional financial assets grapple with inflation and geopolitical uncertainties, companies are increasingly looking towards alternative stores of value. For Bitcoin Treasury Capital, a company whose very name signals its core strategy, each Bitcoin acquisition reinforces its long-term vision. This isn’t merely speculative trading; it’s a deliberate treasury management strategy aimed at preserving and potentially growing capital in a deflationary asset. Consider the implications: Institutional Confidence: It demonstrates that corporate entities are moving beyond mere exploration of Bitcoin to active integration into their financial reserves. Market Maturation: Such consistent purchases contribute to Bitcoin’s stability and legitimacy as an institutional-grade asset. Shareholder Value: For shareholders, it signals a management team confident in Bitcoin’s future price appreciation and its role as a hedge against macroeconomic instability. This incremental yet significant Bitcoin acquisition by Bitcoin Treasury Capital aligns with a broader trend of public and private companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. It’s a testament to the evolving perception of Bitcoin from a niche digital currency to a global reserve asset. Why Are Companies Pursuing Bitcoin Acquisition? The decision for a company to undertake a substantial Bitcoin acquisition is multifaceted, driven by a blend of economic foresight, technological belief, and strategic positioning. It’s not a decision taken lightly, often involving extensive due diligence and board approval. So, what are the compelling reasons behind this growing trend? 1. Inflation Hedge and Store of Value With global quantitative easing and rising inflation concerns, traditional fiat currencies are experiencing devaluing effects. Bitcoin, with its capped supply of 21 million coins, presents itself as a digital gold – a scarce asset designed to appreciate over time as demand outstrips supply. Companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital see it as a superior alternative to holding depreciating cash reserves. 2. Balance Sheet Diversification Just as investors diversify their portfolios, corporations are seeking to diversify their treasury holdings beyond traditional bonds and cash. Bitcoin offers a non-correlated asset that can potentially enhance overall portfolio returns and reduce risk exposure to conventional market downturns. 3. Future Growth and Innovation Investing in Bitcoin is also an investment in the future of finance and technology. Companies that embrace Bitcoin are positioning themselves at the forefront of the digital economy, signaling innovation and adaptability. This can attract tech-savvy investors and employees. 4. Shareholder Alignment For some companies, a Bitcoin acquisition strategy resonates deeply with their investor base, particularly those with a strong belief in the future of decentralized finance. It can be a way to align corporate strategy with shareholder expectations and even attract new investors interested in exposure to digital assets. Here’s a simplified comparison of traditional treasury assets vs. Bitcoin: Feature Traditional Cash/Bonds Bitcoin (BTC) Inflation Exposure High (value erodes over time) Low (deflationary by design) Volatility Low (generally stable) High (significant price swings) Accessibility High (easy to acquire/spend) Moderate (requires digital infrastructure) Growth Potential Low (yields often below inflation) High (potential for substantial appreciation) Decentralization Centralized (controlled by governments/banks) Decentralized (no single entity control) The Broader Impact of Corporate Bitcoin Acquisition Every time a publicly traded company announces a significant Bitcoin acquisition , it contributes to a larger narrative: the mainstreaming of cryptocurrency. These corporate endorsements are crucial for Bitcoin’s journey towards wider adoption and acceptance. They provide a stamp of legitimacy that can influence institutional investors, sovereign wealth funds, and even other corporations to consider similar moves.

You know, in this digital era, the crypto market is maturing, and investors now have good judgment. But do you know that between all these, a new class of digital assets is emerging that prioritizes sustainability, scalability, and, of course, your security. Bitcoin.ℏ is a sustainable cryptocurrency built on Hedera Hashgraph and offering a compelling answer to the growing demand for crypto alternatives. And the best part is that it has zero mining, low fees with capped supply, and quantum resistance. That is why BTC.ℏ is positioning itself as a serious contender among bitcoin alternatives. Now we find out if it is eco-conscious or future-ready, ESG-focused. A Sustainable Cryptocurrency in a High-Energy Market As you know, the traditional Bitcoin has long faced criticism for its energy-intensive mining process, and according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin mining consumes more energy annually than entire countries like Argentina. That’s why the retail and institutional investors are concerned about increasing ESG standards. BTC.ℏ operates on Hedera Hashgraph, which is a next-gen distributed ledger, and it does not require mining, which means it lowers energy use drastically by several orders of magnitude, and it makes BTC.ℏ a true green crypto. And not only that, Hedera is carbon negative and purchases offsets beyond its minimal footprint. That is why investors focused on sustainability and BTC.ℏ offers a unique advantage and value of Bitcoin’s limited supply without a large harmful impact on the environment. Built On Hedera-Quantum Resistant and Fast The other best thing is BTC.ℏ, which benefits from the advanced security and speed of Hedera Hashgraph, and it is distinct from blockchain. And its asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) ensures fairness and low-latency transaction finality, ideal for modern use cases. You know the world is rapidly advancing in quantum computing, and that is why today, security matters more than ever. Don’t worry, BTC.ℏ is being developed with quantum resistance in mind, and its coin is evolving against cryptographic threats, and Bitcoin itself may struggle to address this without significant upgrades. Capped Supply and Low fees are the Real Investment Fundamentals. Just like Bitcoin BTC.ℏ, it also follows a capped supply model and reinforces the principle of digital scarcity that drives long-term value. But unlike Bitcoin, it has low transaction fees that make it more practical for everyday use and high-frequency transactions. These characteristics are critical for investors who are looking beyond hype and towards investment fundamentals with a finite supply, scalable infrastructure, and low friction for both the users and business. Traction and Exchange Listings BTC.ℏ is not just a concept, but it is gaining real-world momentum. And it is already listed on CoinEx and Biconomy because BTC.ℏ is providing its legitimacy and accessibility in the broader crypto market. Exchange listings are more than mere milestones, and they serve as external validation that a coin is trade-ready and gaining demand. Macro Trends That Support BTC.ℏ’s Rise The rise of BTC.ℏ is becoming a broader crypto investment trend because of the following things. Growing demand for sustainable cryptocurrency options. Due to a shift from high legacy coins towards efficient systems. The rising awareness of quantum security in digital assets is also one reason. Governments are making more rules to cut down pollution and save energy. BTC.ℏ sits at the crossroads of all these trends and combines green technology, robust security, and sound monetary policy. Is BTC.ℏ the Smart Bitcoin Alternative? If you are an investor and looking for the next evolution of Bitcoin that aligns with modern values of sustainability and security, then Bitcoin.ℏ may be the answer because it is a thoughtfully engineered, eco-friendly, quantum-resistant digital asset that is designed for the future. Why Eco-Friendly Crypto Matters to the Market Now, due to awareness and knowledge, investors and institutions are paying close attention to the effect made by cryptocurrencies on the environment, and if you are one of them, then Bitcoin.ℏ is for you. Why? Because it is running on Hedera Hashgraph, which is a network known for its energy-efficient design, this coin offers a clean alternative to traditional mining-based tokens. As the world starts caring more about climate and environment, coins like Bitcoin.ℏ are better aligned with long-term financial and ethical goals. This gives it an edge as a green crypto option for investors like you who want to perform without any guilt.

The lawmakers are demanding JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and Bank of America boss Brian Moynihan produce documents related to the Hong Kong listing of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), which supplies batteries to Tesla and other electric-vehicle makers, reports the Wall Street Journal. The politicians making the demands of the two US banks serve on the House of Representatives’ Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, which focuses on the national security threat posed by China. In April, the congressional committee urged JPMorgan and Bank of America to cease their involvement in CATL’s listing since the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) added CATL to its list of “Chinese military companies,” and the committee warned of “serious regulatory, financial, and reputational risks” if they did not. Despite the warning, JPMorgan and Bank of America helped underwrite CATL’s IPO. Says Rep. John Moolenaar (R-Michigan), the committee chair, in the subpoena, “CATL’s industry-leading role in battery manufacturing – a sector explicitly targeted by China’s state-driven military-civil fusion policy – poses significant US investor and national security risks.” The committee says in its subpoenas that the banks failed to produce previously requested information on the IPO matter. Meanwhile, Dimon defended underwriting CATL’s IPO in a May interview on Bloomberg TV. “We and other investment banks did a lot of due diligence around all the issues that people raised. If we thought it was wrong, we wouldn’t do it.” Meanwhile, a Bank of America spokesman says the bank will continue to work with the committee. Contemporary Amperex Technology says in its public documents that it believes the DOD incorrectly added it to the list and is “engaging with DOD to address the false designation.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

2025-07-26 07:15:12+00:00,Bitcoin Bull Run: Is 2025 Peak Coming Or Has The Cycle Changed?,"The post Bitcoin Bull Run: Is 2025 Peak Coming Or Has The Cycle Changed? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto markets used to move four-year cycles, driven by Bitcoin halving, interest rates, and major industry crashes. However, industry experts now note that these patterns have been fading and new forces are starting to shape the market. Is the 4-Year Cycle Breaking Down? Bitcoin recently broke above its new all-time highs and surged past $123,000. Bitcoin cycles typically last around 1,070 days from the market bottom to the next peak. If history repeats, this bull run could continue until October 20, 2025, which suggests that the cycle isn’t over yet. BITCOIN CYCLE ISN''T OVER Each Bitcoin cycle has lasted approximately 1,070 days from the bottom of the bear market to the bull market peak. If this trend continues, the bull market is expected to last until October 20, 2025. pic.twitter.com/6tLHf8wGwz — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 26, 2025 Long-Term Forces Will Outpower the 4-Year Cycle Bitwise CIO, Matt Hougan , is one of those who think that the classic four-year crypto cycle is breaking down. He notes that Bitcoin halvings matter less each time. Interest rates that were once a headwind are now helping crypto. With clear regulations in place and more institutional players, major blowups are now less likely. ETF adoption has just begun, and he believes that it is a 5-10 year trend. Institutional money is slowly entering, with pensions, endowments, and national platforms now considering crypto. Wall Street is finally investing seriously in crypto, and he expects that it will invest billions in the quarters and years to come. Big names like JP Morgan and Standard Chartered are already exploring crypto products. “All this suggests to me that the long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic “four-year cycle” forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year,” he said. The Biggest Risk? However, he notes that “the biggest emergent cyclical-style risk” is the rise of Treasury companies. In the last month alone, 22 public companies added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pushing the total to 160. #Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. My predictions were based on it—buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 24, 2025 CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju had also said that the old Bitcoin cycle is over. He says the pattern of predicting markets by tracking whale buys and retail FOMO no longer fits. This time, old whales are selling to new long-term holders, not retail. BTC Still On Track But some have stuck by the 4-year cycle.

The post Bitcoin Bull Run: Is 2025 Peak Coming Or Has The Cycle Changed? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto markets used to move four-year cycles, driven by Bitcoin halving, interest rates, and major industry crashes. However, industry experts now note that these patterns have been fading and new forces are starting to shape the market. Is the 4-Year Cycle Breaking Down? Bitcoin recently broke above its new all-time highs and surged past $123,000. Bitcoin cycles typically last around 1,070 days from the market bottom to the next peak. If history repeats, this bull run could continue until October 20, 2025, which suggests that the cycle isn’t over yet. BITCOIN CYCLE ISN''T OVER Each Bitcoin cycle has lasted approximately 1,070 days from the bottom of the bear market to the bull market peak. If this trend continues, the bull market is expected to last until October 20, 2025. pic.twitter.com/6tLHf8wGwz — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) July 26, 2025 Long-Term Forces Will Outpower the 4-Year Cycle Bitwise CIO, Matt Hougan , is one of those who think that the classic four-year crypto cycle is breaking down. He notes that Bitcoin halvings matter less each time. Interest rates that were once a headwind are now helping crypto. With clear regulations in place and more institutional players, major blowups are now less likely. ETF adoption has just begun, and he believes that it is a 5-10 year trend. Institutional money is slowly entering, with pensions, endowments, and national platforms now considering crypto. Wall Street is finally investing seriously in crypto, and he expects that it will invest billions in the quarters and years to come. Big names like JP Morgan and Standard Chartered are already exploring crypto products. “All this suggests to me that the long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic “four-year cycle” forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year,” he said. The Biggest Risk? However, he notes that “the biggest emergent cyclical-style risk” is the rise of Treasury companies. In the last month alone, 22 public companies added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, pushing the total to 160. #Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. My predictions were based on it—buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 24, 2025 CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju had also said that the old Bitcoin cycle is over. He says the pattern of predicting markets by tracking whale buys and retail FOMO no longer fits. This time, old whales are selling to new long-term holders, not retail. BTC Still On Track But some have stuck by the 4-year cycle. Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer believes Bitcoin is still closely tracking its four-year cycle, pointing to its recent all-time highs. ETF analyst James Seyffart believes that the cycle still exists but is weaker.

2025-07-26 07:25:10+00:00,Ethereum Price: Is an Epic Pullback Looming Amidst Euphoric Frenzy?,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Price: Is an Epic Pullback Looming Amidst Euphoric Frenzy? The world of cryptocurrency is a whirlwind of innovation, opportunity, and, often, intense emotional swings. Lately, all eyes have been on the remarkable surge in Ethereum price , as ETH has soared to impressive new heights. This rally has certainly sparked widespread excitement, yet seasoned observers and on-chain analytics platforms like Santiment are beginning to raise a cautious flag. Could this period of intense bullishness, described as ‘extreme euphoria,’ actually be signaling an impending short-term correction for Ethereum price ? Understanding the ‘Extreme Euphoria’ in Ethereum Price When we talk about ‘extreme euphoria’ in the context of Ethereum price , we’re primarily referring to a significant surge in social media mentions and overall public sentiment. Cointelegraph, citing Santiment, highlighted that social dominance for ETH has reached levels often associated with market tops. But what exactly does ‘social dominance’ mean, and why is it a warning sign? Social Dominance Explained: This metric tracks the percentage of cryptocurrency-related discussions on social media platforms (like X, Reddit, Telegram) that are focused on a particular asset, in this case, Ethereum. A high social dominance indicates that ETH is a hot topic, capturing a large share of the crypto conversation. The Contrarian Indicator: Historically, periods of overwhelming social euphoria often precede price corrections. When everyone is talking about an asset, and sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, it can suggest that most potential buyers have already entered the market. This leaves fewer new buyers to push the price higher, making the asset vulnerable to profit-taking. A Crowded Trade: High social dominance can also point to a ‘crowded trade,’ meaning a large number of investors are positioned on the same side (long). While this can fuel a rally in the short term, it creates significant downside risk if sentiment shifts, as many investors might rush to exit simultaneously. The recent spike in Ethereum price discussions on social platforms, reaching these ‘euphoric’ levels, serves as a crucial reminder for investors to approach the market with caution, despite the compelling narrative of growth. The ETH/BTC Ratio Surge: A Deeper Dive into Ethereum Price Dynamics Another significant factor contributing to the current market narrative around Ethereum price is its performance relative to Bitcoin. Since early May, the ETH/BTC price ratio has jumped an astounding 70%. This isn’t just a number; it’s a powerful indicator of shifting market dynamics and investor preference. Relative Strength: The ETH/BTC ratio is a key metric for understanding Ethereum’s relative strength against Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency. When this ratio rises, it means Ethereum is outperforming Bitcoin, often signaling a period where capital is flowing from Bitcoin into altcoins, particularly Ethereum. Altcoin Season Bellwether: A strong ETH/BTC ratio is frequently seen as a precursor or an active sign of an ‘altcoin season,’ where alternative cryptocurrencies experience significant gains. Ethereum, being the second-largest crypto and the backbone of DeFi and NFTs, often leads this charge. Implications for Portfolios: For investors, a rising ETH/BTC ratio suggests that holding Ethereum might be more profitable than holding Bitcoin during certain market phases. However, a sharp, rapid increase can also indicate an overheated market, where speculative fervor drives assets higher unsustainably. While the 70% jump in the ETH/BTC ratio undeniably showcases Ethereum’s recent dominance, it also amplifies the concern about a potentially overextended rally, adding another layer of complexity to the Ethereum price outlook. Are Broader Market Indicators Signaling Caution for Ethereum Price? Despite the warning signs from social sentiment and the ETH/BTC ratio, Santiment also noted a nuanced point: broader market indicators do not yet reflect ‘peak frothiness.’ This suggests that while individual asset sentiment might be high, the overall crypto market might not be at its absolute top, implying that the rally for Ethereum price could still have room to run. But what are these ‘broader market indicators,’ and how do they differ from social sentiment? On-Chain Metrics: These include data points like active addresses, transaction volumes, exchange inflows/outflows, and miner behavior. For instance, if a large amount of ETH is being moved off exchanges into self-custody, it can signal long-term holding intentions, reducing immediate selling pressure. Derivatives Market Data: Funding rates on perpetual futures contracts, open interest, and options market data can provide insights into leverage in the system. Extremely high positive funding rates, for example, often indicate an overheated market with excessive bullish leverage. Institutional Flows: Tracking inflows into institutional produc",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/ethereum-price-pullback-euphoria/,ETH|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|BTC,Crypto News|CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|ETHEREUM|Market Analysis|PRICE PREDICTION,BTC,"Ethereum Price: Is an Epic Pullback Looming Amidst Euphoric Frenzy?.

In the past month, its price increased by 12.04%, and over the last six months, it saw a rise of 12.66%. However, the past week experienced a slight dip of 0.42%, bringing the current price range between $114,610 and $120,963. The cryptocurrency is hovering around its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, which are $118,387 and $118,297 respectively. This suggests a period of consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 47.16, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic value is 64.29, showing neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The MACD level is at -52.57, pointing to potential bearish sentiment. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $124,685. Breaking above this could push the price toward the second resistance at $131,038, an increase of roughly 9%. On the downside, the nearest support is at $111,979. If the price falls below this, it may test the second support level of $105,626, which would be a decrease of about 5%.

Despite the monthly gain, the 6-month change shows a slight dip of 0.54%. The Relative Strength Index stands at 34.65, nearing oversold territory, which might hint at a potential price rebound. The MACD level is negative at -0.0805, suggesting bearish tendencies, but the substantial monthly increase could offset this outlook. If XRP breaks above the resistance at $4.16, it could aim for the next level at $5.02, representing an increase of over 30% from current levels. On the downside, support lies at $2.45, and further at $1.60 if selling intensifies. These key levels will be crucial in determining XRP''s next move.

2025-07-26 08:32:00+00:00,LATAM crypto news: VERT drives asset tokenization in Brazil as Grupo Murano bets $10B on BTC treasury,"This week’s most notable news in Latin America is that the Brazilian financial system moves closer to global trends in financial digitalisation, setting the stage for a more modern, agile, and secure infrastructure. On the other hand, Mexico’s Grupo Murano announced that it would invest up to $10 billion in a time frame of 5 years to create a Bitcoin Treasury. Brazil’s capital markets take a key step toward digitalisation VERT has built a revolutionary blockchain platform for private credit on the XRP Ledger (XRPL), with the goal of improving securitisation operations’ efficiency and transparency. This revolutionary technology automates critical procedures in structured credit, from issue to settlement, with real-time tracking and full traceability. As a result, the Brazilian financial system is becoming more aligned with global financial digitisation trends, paving the way for a more contemporary, adaptable, and secure infrastructure. The platform’s first milestone was the issuance of a 700-million-real Agribusiness Receivables Certificate (CRA), which is equivalent to around $130 million. VERT’s solution, which leverages XRPL’s low costs and speedy settlement capabilities, as well as the XRPL EVM Sidechain for smart contract functionality, introduces new levels of transparency, cost-efficiency, and coordination. The platform, which is backed by Ripple, conforms with Brazilian regulations and boosts investor confidence. With over 350 structured credit transactions and $10.51 billion in assets under management, VERT solidifies its leading position by advancing blockchain innovation in regulated capital markets. Grupo Murano bets big on Bitcoin with $10 billion treasury strategy Mexican real estate firm Grupo Murano has announced that it will invest as much as $10 billion into Bitcoin over five years to build a Bitcoin treasury. The firm, known for designing hotels, resorts, and shopping malls in Mexico, has joined the ranks of companies that have adopted Bitcoin as a core strategic reserve asset, a trend that is expected to spread globally. Grupo Murano not only diversifies its portfolio by exposing up to 80% of its assets to Bitcoin, but it also embraces digital transformation across its whole order book. The company is placing Bitcoin ATMs in its venues. This bold move catapults Murano into the ranks of leading global companies such as Méliuz, Vanadi Coffee, and Trump Media that also have Bitcoin in their treasuries. Ripio and Tapi’s partnership brings crypto payments to Argentina Argentine crypto exchange Ripio has teamed up with payment FinTech Tapi to allow users to pay for more than 5,000 services directly through the Ripio app , including utilities, phone bills, internet, school fees and subscription services. With this integration, users can now process these payments with cryptocurrencies, without the need to convert to Argentine pesos, representing a difference between crypto as an asset for investments to crypto as a medium of exchange. Ripio operates in several Latin American countries, including Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, and provides access to major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins such as USDT and USDC. Supported by cross-chain QR codes and seamless conversion in real time, this new feature simplifies payments in compliance with local laws while reinforcing user trust.

2025-07-26 08:35:24+00:00,"Top Investor Releases His 2025 Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Price Predictions","Crypto strategist and investor Armando Pantoja has reaffirmed his price targets for 2025 across three leading digital assets: XRP, Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH). According to his latest tweet, Pantoja stated that his projections remain unchanged since first sharing them publicly during an appearance at the New York Stock Exchange in 2023. His forecast outlines a target of $8 to $12 for XRP, $250,000 for Bitcoin, and between $10,000 and $12,000 for Ethereum. The tweet included a direct quote of the original targets and emphasized their consistency over time. Pantoja wrote, “2025 Targets: XRP = $8–$12, BTC = $250k, ETH = $10k–$12k. These targets haven’t changed since I called them out @NYSE in 2023.” There was no elaboration on what data models or technical frameworks were used to derive these values. However, the repetition of the message appears to reinforce his confidence in the models’ accuracy. 2025 Targets: $XRP = $8-$12 $BTC = $250k $ETH = $10k – $12k These targets haven''t changed since I called them out @NYSE in 2023. pic.twitter.com/XEGOKyfkLq — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 24, 2025 Crypto Community Reactions The post gained attention from several figures in the crypto community who offered their interpretations. A user by the name RenegadeTV expressed the view that while the predictions for BTC and ETH were fair, the projection for XRP was modest. “Too low on XRP. About right on BTC and ETH could go closer to 18k. XRP will be much higher,” RenegadeTV commented. The sentiment suggested a belief that XRP’s long-term value could exceed the $12 upper limit proposed by Pantoja, potentially due to its increasing adoption or pending regulatory developments. Another response came from Darius Ellis, who acknowledged the projection and said it was “locked in.” He argued that the valuation range for XRP was not merely technical but based on the asset’s evolving role in financial infrastructure. He wrote, “$8–12 XRP isn’t just a chart call, it reflects growing utility, settlement velocity, and the rails being built in silence.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He went on to add that the broader market was overlooking the significance of infrastructure-based digital assets, suggesting that once the ecosystem matures, gains would be measured in “multiples, not percentages.” He concluded by proposing that the community revisit the post after more developments. Price Forecasts Emphasize Confidence Amid Market Uncertainty Pantoja’s reaffirmation of his 2025 targets arrives at a time when the crypto market continues to experience short-term volatility, with all three assets experiencing price fluctuations in response to macroeconomic factors, regulatory shifts, and institutional involvement. Despite these short-term uncertainties, Pantoja’s decision to stick to his earlier projections appears to reflect a long-term conviction about digital assets’ maturing fundamentals and broader adoption trajectory. While some analysts might view his BTC and ETH projections as optimistic, they fall within the broader range of institutional outlooks that assume exponential growth if certain conditions are met. However, the XRP forecast continues to attract attention, partly due to the ongoing legal and regulatory developments surrounding its classification and use cases in global finance. Armando Pantoja has made it clear that he stands by his targets set two years prior, reiterating them now with the same conviction. As 2025 proceeds, attention is likely to remain fixed on how well these forecasts hold up against the realities of market dynamics and blockchain adoption curves.

However, the repetition of the message appears to reinforce his confidence in the models’ accuracy. 2025 Targets: $XRP = $8-$12 $BTC = $250k $ETH = $10k – $12k These targets haven''t changed since I called them out @NYSE in 2023. pic.twitter.com/XEGOKyfkLq — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 24, 2025 Crypto Community Reactions The post gained attention from several figures in the crypto community who offered their interpretations. A user by the name RenegadeTV expressed the view that while the predictions for BTC and ETH were fair, the projection for XRP was modest. “Too low on XRP. About right on BTC and ETH could go closer to 18k. XRP will be much higher,” RenegadeTV commented. The sentiment suggested a belief that XRP’s long-term value could exceed the $12 upper limit proposed by Pantoja, potentially due to its increasing adoption or pending regulatory developments. Another response came from Darius Ellis, who acknowledged the projection and said it was “locked in.” He argued that the valuation range for XRP was not merely technical but based on the asset’s evolving role in financial infrastructure. He wrote, “$8–12 XRP isn’t just a chart call, it reflects growing utility, settlement velocity, and the rails being built in silence.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He went on to add that the broader market was overlooking the significance of infrastructure-based digital assets, suggesting that once the ecosystem matures, gains would be measured in “multiples, not percentages.” He concluded by proposing that the community revisit the post after more developments. Price Forecasts Emphasize Confidence Amid Market Uncertainty Pantoja’s reaffirmation of his 2025 targets arrives at a time when the crypto market continues to experience short-term volatility, with all three assets experiencing price fluctuations in response to macroeconomic factors, regulatory shifts, and institutional involvement. Despite these short-term uncertainties, Pantoja’s decision to stick to his earlier projections appears to reflect a long-term conviction about digital assets’ maturing fundamentals and broader adoption trajectory. While some analysts might view his BTC and ETH projections as optimistic, they fall within the broader range of institutional outlooks that assume exponential growth if certain conditions are met. However, the XRP forecast continues to attract attention, partly due to the ongoing legal and regulatory developments surrounding its classification and use cases in global finance. Armando Pantoja has made it clear that he stands by his targets set two years prior, reiterating them now with the same conviction. As 2025 proceeds, attention is likely to remain fixed on how well these forecasts hold up against the realities of market dynamics and blockchain adoption curves.

2025-07-26 08:41:02+00:00,"Galaxy Digital sold over 80,000 bitcoins for a Satoshi-era investor","Galaxy Digital has facilitated the sale of over 80,000 bitcoin, an amount worth more than $9 billion, for a Satoshi-era investor in what’s now being called one of the biggest transactions in crypto history. This was confirmed by Galaxy in a statement released today. The anonymous client behind the sale is one of the earliest holders of bitcoin, with the transaction forming part of what the firm described as a long-term estate planning strategy. The sale happened on Thursday, when Mike Novogratz’s firm began sending billions in BTC to exchanges. The total amount moved was around $4 billion, with wallet activity traced by Arkham Analytics. The act of moving coins to exchanges doesn’t automatically mean a liquidation, but in this case, Galaxy later withdrew about $1.15 billion in stablecoins, meaning that a significant portion of the assets had in fact already been sold. Sale pulls early coins into circulation and shakes up price movement Galaxy didn’t identify the seller but described the move as a carefully planned financial step by the investor, who had sat on this stash since the early 2010s or earlier. Bitcoin’s price, which had dropped to under $115,000 overnight, bounced back slightly on Friday to $117,200, though it still remained 1.2% down over the previous 24 hours. That rebound came despite large volumes moving into active markets. The crypto had been trading within a narrow range for the past four days. While the sale didn’t crash the market, it did raise new concerns about liquidity and sell-side pressure. As trading volume picked up, debates over valuation resurfaced. Bitcoin’s worth, like always, hinged on what the next buyer is willing to pay. Citigroup report breaks down new valuation models and trends On the same day the sale became public, Citigroup analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert released a detailed report on how to assess bitcoin’s price. “The price of bitcoin ultimately depends on how many people want to hold it,” the report said. The updated framework introduced by Citi combined previous approaches and incorporated recent macro changes. The analysis built on earlier work from 2022, which had included electricity cost as a price floor, a stock-to-flow ratio for gauging scarcity, adoption levels to evaluate the network, and macroeconomic trends, specifically, how the coin correlates with equities and the dollar. The latest update didn’t just rehash those points. It introduced a more urgent tone, claiming that crypto is now too significant to be ignored. “Back in 2022, the question was whether crypto had any impact on the real economy. Today, the question is how much exposure investors already have—whether they realize it or not,” Saunders said. The report said that crypto assets have grown to the point where their market caps rival major public companies, and they’re now embedded in top financial indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell. One figure stood out. Crypto-related holdings now account for 7.6% by weight in Bloomberg’s U.S. Convertible Liquid Bond Index. Much of that exposure ties back to MicroStrategy, which has long been a major institutional holder of bitcoin . That number alone is why, as Citi put it, “even crypto-agnostic clients must now track these markets.” The purpose of the new model was to help clients understand their crypto exposure without guessing or relying on rough price estimates. And while adoption remains one of the core inputs, Citi warned that increased involvement from traditional finance, especially if regulatory clarity continues, will blur the lines between crypto and the traditional market even more. “Traditional institutions are already in it, whether they like it or not,” Rupert added. “The regulatory signals are clearer, and the stakes are higher.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

2025-07-26 08:54:37+00:00,YBIT Seems The Least Appealing Bitcoin Option Strategy,"Summary YBIT offers a high monthly yield through a dynamic options approach, but its complexity could make it less suitable for some portfolios. Its dynamic structure and higher yield (over 40%) make it intriguing but prone to NAV erosion. This is why it’s better to treat it as a tactical tool for spot trades. It has high costs but is still fairly liquid despite its low AUM. Despite remaining high‑NAV‑erosion‑risk solutions, among the high‑income Bitcoin options, BTCI seems to offer more NAV protection. “But did you know that Bitcoin can become a yield‑generating asset?” That was the opening remark from a colleague of mine, someone “purely” from the banking world, just back from a road show of his network. He then told me about YieldMax™ Bitcoin Option Income ETF ( YBIT ) : first, it made me reflect on how here on Seeking Alpha we stay one step ahead when it comes to “financial engineering”; then, on how option income strategy ETFs are becoming an increasingly popular component, even in institutional circuits; and finally, on how little people actually understand what we’re talking about. My opinion? Yes, the strategic approach proposed by YBIT is interesting, but it’s not suitable for every type of portfolio, and, above all, it’s a step behind other solutions: in my view, BTCI positions itself better. But before explaining why, you need to know that … The Vision Of … YieldMax is always very clear : the primary goal is to create a current monthly income. Tracking Bitcoin , we could say, is a sort of side question for the management. Data by YCharts And I have to say, the way they achieve this goal is more articulated than what has been done with other ETFs: simply because it’s “dynamic.” That is, they don’t use a single strategy; instead, they have a book of alternatives, and in this it reminds me a bit of LFGY , a YieldMax ETF that I honestly appreciate. According to the prospectus , YBIT can make use of synthetic covered calls: buying calls + selling puts to replicate the underlying ETP without physically owning it. But also the classic standard covered call writing, selling out‑of‑the‑money calls (0%–15% above the current price), as well as opportunistic credit call spreads, meaning in certain cases they sell calls and buy higher calls to capture part of the additional upside. All this with intensive use of FLEX options (customized options) and collateral in U.S. Treasury securities with maturities from 6 months to 2 years. synthetic covered calls classic standard covered call opportunistic credit call spreads Let me say it: a book of strategies that almost seems to tell the investor, “trust our management, we will manage to profit through various market phases.” That semi‑active management that often, however, is an illusion of security . But let’s get straight to the point… is it really so? Partly Yes, But… First of all, this “multi‑strategy option” approach has a cost: 4.76% when adding up the various items. A factor that certainly cannot be ignored. YBIT - Fund Profile (Seeking Alpha) And it has a low AUM of $147M, which shifts my concern to liquidity. A concern that is unfounded, because the bid/ask spread is 0.09%, therefore quite tight, and surprisingly, the average daily volume is over 930% higher than the average: so the slippage risk is reduced compared to other ETFs with that level of AUM. YBIT - Liquidity Grade (Seeking Alpha) But costs are secondary, and what we care about is performance: a variable element by definition, even though the yield since inception has been pleasantly steady, especially in distributions. As of now we are talking about a TTM yield of around 78%, paid monthly. A distribution that, judging from the 19a filings , is 97% ROC and only 2.59% income. YBIT - Dividend Grade (Seeking Alpha) Considering that the SEC yield is 1.54%, it means the income naturally comes from option premiums. So, in my view, to really understand whether the multi‑strategy approach is or isn’t an “illusion of security,” I look at the holding distribution. Today’s Composition Is Not The Same As Yesterday’s (Or Tomorrow’s) But this is exactly its strength. The strategy changes, theoretically adapting to market conditions: in other words, it addresses one of the main criticisms, the statistical limits of buy‑write (covered call strategy). It’s therefore impossible not to mention the constant rolling of options and the high turnover (28% in the first half) along with high implicit costs. Today, its composition is this: YBIT - Holding distribution (Seeking Alpha) ~50% options on IBIT ~45% Treasury Bills and Notes~1.7% Money Market FundCash & Other negative (–0.55%) Peer Analysis: The Illusion Of Security Quick thought: this dynamism gives YBIT a hedge.

However, if the Manta price successfully breaks above $0.263, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.339. MANTAUSD Price Chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Manta’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.213, resulting in a correction to $0.168. Is MANTA a good investment? Manta’s rapid rise in DeFi TVL charts and alignment with Ethereum ‘s scaling roadmap via technologies like Manta Pacific suggest $MANTA’s potential. Grants support its ecosystem growth, and it leads in ZK technology adoption, promising for blockchain ‘s future. However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.23. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.21. Will Manta price recover?

2025-07-26 09:06:50+00:00,Best Crypto Presales to Ride the Dip as XRP and Dogecoin Prices Fall,"The post Best Crypto Presales to Ride the Dip as XRP and Dogecoin Prices Fall appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News After this month’s disorienting mix of bullish momentum and widespread profit-taking, the crypto market has taken a sharp turn. Earlier this week, more than $1.29 billion worth of crypto positions were liquidated, closing over 277,000 traders’ positions – and the price of Bitcoin briefly dipped by almost 5% to lows around $115,000. Two of the most heavily impacted crypto assets are XRP and Dogecoin (DOGE), which both saw their valuations drop by billions of dollars. While this volatility may shake short-term holders, the shrewdest investors are turning to early-stage crypto presales as a way to manage risk and diversify their holdings. To help investors navigate the current wave of volatility, we’ll highlight three emerging altcoins that are currently in presale. Available at discount prices that will quickly increase as the sales continue, these tokens offer a way to diversify into high-upside opportunities with low entry points. XRP and Dogecoin Tank, Crypto Market Falls 5% in 24 Hours While the crypto markets have been on a record growth spree since early July, jumping from a total valuation of $3.3 trillion to more than $4 trillion, the last few days have come with a lot of volatility. The global crypto market cap now stands at $3.93 trillion, down 5% in the last 24 hours. The meme coin sector has also been hit, dropping by 4% over the last day. Leading altcoins such as XRP (XRP), and blue-chip meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE), have been severely affected by the market’s latest dip. XRP, the third-largest crypto token in the world, is down by almost 10% in the past week. This decline could be tied to rising geopolitical tensions, particularly Donald Trump’s latest proposed tariff hikes , which have unsettled global markets. According to TradingView’s automated technical analysis , XRP currently sits in a mix of neutral and “Buy” zones for the 1-day timeframe, suggesting that traders approach this coin with caution when attempting to buy the dip. DOGE, which saw a massive rally of up to 100% between June 22 and July 21, has now pulled back to a key support level around $0.22, marking a 22% drop in five days. Although DOGE is still up 85% over the last 12 months, its recent fall underscores the volatility that often follows rapid gains. With large-cap assets under pressure, investors are increasingly seeking presale-stage tokens that may offer more upside with reduced short-term risk. Here are three of the best crypto presales that could help investors ride out the recent market dip. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) One of the standout crypto presales this year has been Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER), which has already raised over $4.8 million. The token is part of a larger mission to create the first-ever Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution built specifically for the Bitcoin network. By introducing faster speeds, lower fees, and DeFi functionality to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Hyper aims to significantly enhance the network’s utility. At the core of this innovation is the high-throughput Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which powers Bitcoin Hyper’s L2 environment. NEW Crypto – First Ever Bitcoin Layer 2 Chain! The system bridges native BTC from the Bitcoin Layer 1 onto Bitcoin Hyper’s Layer 2 network, using zero-knowledge proofs and a secure bridge. Once on the L2, users can enjoy near-instant wrapped BTC transfers, staking rewards, and access to decentralized apps – using the HYPER token to pay for L2 transactions. For added incentives, token holders can stake HYPER (priced at $0.0124 per token) to generate an APY (annual percentage yield) of up to 204%, with over 257 million tokens already staked. This combination of clear utility and staking appeal is a major reason why analysts like Austin Hilton see huge growth potential in Bitcoin Hyper. With its focus on scalability and innovation, Bitcoin Hyper is clearly planning to become a long-term player in the crypto space. Visit Bitcoin Hyper Presale TOKEN6900 (T6900) TOKEN6900 (T6900) has burst onto the scene with bold branding and an unapologetically absurd concept. Marketed as “the new global benchmark for brain rot finance,” the token has raised over $1.1 million in its presale by embracing humor, chaos, and community culture over traditional fundamentals. Inspired by the success of SPX6900 (SPX), which soared over 6,900% in the last year, TOKEN6900 hopes to replicate the same viral trajectory. Along with a similarly chaotic energy, the project has even minted exactly one token more than SPX’s total supply as a tongue-in-cheek nod to its roots. NEW PROFITABLE PRESALE? (TOKEN6900 Presale Review) T6900 may have no roadmap in the traditional sense, but it does have a clear mission to build a large community of loyal followers.

2025-07-26 09:30:46+00:00,XRP and Solana Pull Back as WeWake Shows Strong Potential to Become a Top Crypto Presale,"XRP and Solana face short-term corrections as Bitcoin consolidates, prompting traders to seek new crypto opportunities. WeWake rises as a top presale crypto, offering walletless, gasless Web3 access through smart wallets and social logins. With a clear roadmap and utility-driven tokenomics, WeWake is drawing attention from developers and early-stage crypto investors. XRP and Solana are experiencing pullbacks as the crypto market cools and Bitcoin remains flat near $120,000. Investors are now focusing on WeWake, a top presale crypto offering walletless and gasless access to Web3. With simple social logins and developer-friendly tools, WeWake is positioned to simplify crypto adoption and attract mainstream users. Altcoin Momentum Slows as XRP and Solana Retreat After a strong rally across major altcoins in July, XRP and Solana are now facing signs of short-term fatigue. While Bitcoin remains in a tight range near $120,000, traders are rotating capital away from top altcoins. XRP is down 6% from its recent local high, and Solana has retraced nearly 7%, according to CoinGecko. Analysts believe this correction is driven by over-leveraged long positions and the buildup of sell orders. “We are seeing heavy liquidation potential in Solana due to record-high open interest,” said Ryan McMillin, CIO at Merkle Tree Capital. This behavior has historically triggered fast but temporary declines across altcoin markets. Ethereum, which led the altcoin rally, is also pausing. Sell pressure on ETH has increased, with 500,000 ETH queued to unstake. Analysts expect this to affect Ethereum ETF inflows and short-term price movement. The weakening momentum in Ethereum has contributed to XRP and Solana’s recent price cooling. Bitcoin Holds Steady While Short-Term Pressure Builds Bitcoin has stayed between $117,000 and $120,000 since mid-July. This consolidation period has offered a temporary boost to altcoins, but analysts now warn of a correction. According to CryptoQuant’s Julio Moreno, Ethereum’s recent strength might reverse, and that could put added pressure on Solana and XRP. CoinGlass reports a rise in ETH sell orders within 10% of its current price, showing short-term caution. Meanwhile, Solana’s open interest suggests increased leverage, which may lead to liquidations if prices drop further. These signs point to a market that is pausing rather than reversing direction. Despite short-term weakness, some analysts are still focused on the broader outlook. McMillin added, “Rate cut expectations and global liquidity trends remain supportive, and we expect continued institutional demand for digital assets.” WeWake Gains Momentum as a Top Presale Crypto While altcoins are pulling back, WeWake is drawing interest as a top presale crypto. The project introduces a walletless and gasless Layer 2 blockchain built for simple Web3 access. WeWake removes the need for traditional wallets, seed phrases, or gas fees, allowing users to sign in with Google or Telegram. This simplified onboarding process is powered by ERC-4337 smart wallets and a zk-rollup Layer 2 framework. “Onboarding into crypto should be as easy as logging into an app,” reads a statement on the WeWake site. The platform’s infrastructure enables this by using built-in Paymaster APIs to sponsor gas for all transactions. Developers can also integrate WeWake’s SDK to onboard users in seconds without downloads or wallet installations. These features make WeWake a top presale crypto as the ecosystem prepares to scale toward mainstream adoption. WeWake Roadmap and Tokenomics Draw Developer Attention The WeWake roadmap outlines four major development phases. In Q4 2025, the platform will focus on core development and integrations. These include its smart wallet architecture, Paymaster logic, and SDK release. A public testnet is scheduled for Q1 2026, followed by a mainnet launch in Q2 2026. During Mainnet, WeWake plans to activate its Paymaster API and launch on both centralized and decentralized exchanges. The platform also aims to roll out Telegram-based wallet tools and open ecosystem grants for GameFi and DeFi dApps. WeWake’s WAKE token has a total supply of 308,726,951. Of this, 32% is allocated to the presale, 14% for ecosystem incentives, and 12% for governance and treasury. The rest is distributed among liquidity, staking rewards, marketing, and reserves. This structured allocation supports sustainable growth and early adoption, making WeWake a top presale crypto of interest to retail users and developers.

2025-07-26 09:45:44+00:00,Wall Street banking giant sets Bitcoin’s price for end of 2025,"Wall Street banking giant Citi (NYSE: C ) is projecting a bullish outlook for Bitcoin ( BTC ) by the end of 2025, with its base-case target set at $135,000. According to the bank’s valuation framework, the flagship digital currency could reach $135,000 while a more optimistic outlook sees Bitcoin surging to $199,000. The updated forecast is guided by Citi’s refined model, which emphasizes three main price drivers, including user adoption, macroeconomic conditions, and inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs . To this end, Citi analysts Alex Saunders and Nathaniel Rupert noted that the core valuation begins with a 20% increase in user growth under a linear network model, supporting a price near $75,000. Macroeconomic headwinds, such as weak equity markets and underperforming gold , are expected to shave off about $3,200. Impact of ETFs on Bitcoin’s price However, Citi anticipates around $15 billion in net ETF inflows, which could add approximately $63,000 to the model, bringing the base-case forecast to $135,000. In its most conservative scenario, Citi expects Bitcoin to drop to $64,000 by year-end if equity markets remain under pressure and ETF inflows fall short. Citi’s analysis also indicated that ETF flows now account for over 40% of BTC’s price movements, making them a central component of the bank’s valuation model. Weekly Bitcoin returns and ETF flows. Source: Citi The analysts highlighted a strong correlation between ETF net flows and BTC returns, estimating that every $1 billion in weekly inflows adds about 3.6% to Bitcoin’s price. “Since launch, 41% of Bitcoin return variation can be explained by flows alone (the relationship is just as strong even accounting for equity returns). So far this year, we have seen just over $19 billion of flows, including $5.5 billion month-to-date. We expect flows to continue for the rest of the year,” Citi noted. The outlook also emphasized crypto’s growing role in traditional finance. In this case, Bitcoin is now included in major indices, such as the S&P 500 and Russell, with rising institutional exposure bolstering its influence across broader markets. Bitcoin price analysis Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues to hold above the $115,000 support zone after a retracement from its record high of $123,000. At press time, BTC was trading at $117,594, up over 2% in the past 24 hours, though down 0.6% for the week. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

Meanwhile, crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that Ethereum could soon hit $4,000, especially if Bitcoin continues climbing toward $120,000. So, is Ethereum getting ready for its next big rally, for the first time in over a year? Strong Resistance, But No Real Drop Yet Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe expected Ethereum to drop before a big move, but that didn’t happen. Instead, ETH kept climbing and has now tested the $3,750–$3,800 zone four times, a sign that buyers are getting stronger. Van de Poppe’s chart hints that ETH might dip toward $3,250 if it shakes out some long positions first. But even if that happens, the overall trend still looks bullish. I expected to see some sort of deeper correction on $ETH , didn''t come. Given that there has been four tests of the resistance already, I would assume that when #Bitcoin goes to $120K+, $ETH goes to $4K and we''ll see #Altcoins provide double digit returns. pic.twitter.com/id7jpDuZem — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 26, 2025 However, Ethereum is already up 138% from its yearly low and is showing strong patterns like an inverse head-and-shoulders and a bullish pennant. These often appear before big price rallies. If ETH breaks above $3,800 with good volume, it could quickly shoot toward $4,000, much sooner than many expect. Bitcoin’s Role in the Bigger Picture Further, Michael believes Ethereum’s next big move is closely tied to Bitcoin. If Bitcoin can successfully rally toward $120,000, a target that’s gaining popularity, it could act like a spark that lights the altcoin market. In that case, Ethereum could easily shoot past $4,000, and many altcoins might follow with double-digit gains. ETF Inflows Fuel the Bullish Sentiment On top of it, Ethereum’s growing interest from institutional investors has given a push to its price. According to SoSoValue , Ethereum ETFs saw over $1.39 billion in inflows this week. While that’s lower than last week’s $2.18 billion, it’s still the 11th week in a row that institutions have been buying in.

2025-07-26 10:22:49+00:00,"Ethereum Price Prediction: Is the $3,500 Threshold ETH’s Launchpad for a New Rally?","Ethereum price has established the $3,500 threshold as a critical launchpad level, while smart money rotation from Bitcoin creates unprecedented institutional demand. ETFs have purchased 1,368,980 ETH this month, compared to only 72,513 ETH minted, effectively buying 18 months’ worth of supply in just three weeks. This supply shock coincides with extreme bearish positioning in CME futures reaching -13,236 contracts, creating substantial fuel for short-covering rallies. Currently trading at $3,708, Ethereum has broken above key resistance levels around $2,600-$2,700 and is approaching the critical $4,000 zone that separates consolidation from explosive breakout territory. Source: TradingView Technical analysis reveals that ETH has been within a massive broadening wedge formation since 2023, with the current positioning testing the upper boundary of this formation. Combined with extreme short positioning and record ETF inflows, the confluence suggests Ethereum may be entering the acceleration phase toward new all-time highs above $4,878. Broadening Wedge Breakout Targets $4,800 Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a massive broadening wedge formation with expanding oscillations that typically precede explosive breakouts. Currently testing the upper boundary around $3,742, ETH approaches the critical $4,000 resistance, which represents the key breakout level of the pattern. $ETH is just one God candle away from the biggest breakout. Once that happens, ETH will pump straight above the previous ATH. It seems like another mic-drop moment is coming for @EricTrump . pic.twitter.com/Unti8pPVXi — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) July 26, 2025 The ascending trendline provides crucial support, while horizontal resistance must be overcome for the major breakout scenario. The mathematical structure suggests that compressed energy exists within the formation, which could produce explosive movements once the upper boundary breaks decisively. Projection targets of $4,800 indicate a measured move potential, calculated from the wedge width, representing approximately 30% upside from current levels. The current positioning suggests ETH is completing the final consolidation phase before resolution toward much higher targets that could exceed previous all-time highs above $4,878. Ethereum Price Prediction: Extreme Short Positioning Fuels Covering Rally CME Ethereum futures data reveals unprecedented bearish positioning reaching -13,236 contracts, representing the most extreme short interest in the dataset’s history. Source: Wise Advice on X This capitulation-level positioning typically precedes significant upward moves as forced covering accelerates price gains. Even modest upward moves could trigger cascading short covering that accelerates gains beyond normal technical resistance. Recent momentum shows “a record-setting 9 daily candles” followed by minimal corrections, describing patterns characteristic of strong trending moves. This progression from support levels through resistance breakouts illustrates methodical institutional accumulation, with foundations being built at each level. The $4,000 target for “end of month” appears achievable given current momentum and short covering, providing additional upward pressure beyond normal buying demand as extreme positioning unwinds. $ETH – #Ethereum will inevitably break its all-time high. pic.twitter.com/hT1vmtWBI1 — Crypto Caesar (@CryptoCaesarTA) July 25, 2025 Snorter: Last Days to Join $2 Presale Success Ethereum’s approach to breaking out above $4,000 and potentially accelerating to $4,800 targets creates ideal conditions for advanced trading strategies. Snorter’s $SNORT token presale has raised over $2 million, with limited allocation remaining before the window closes permanently ahead of Q3 2025 mainnet launch. Early investors are securing final positions in the Telegram-native trading bot positioned for explosive market conditions. The $SNORT token unlocks multiple revenue streams through the expanding ecosystem. Staking rewards reach up to 207% APY for early participants, while reduced trading fees at 0.85% provide ongoing advantages during high-volume trading periods. Token holders gain governance rights and early access to new launches, creating additional value beyond basic trading functionality.

Ethereum price has established the $3,500 threshold as a critical launchpad level, while smart money rotation from Bitcoin creates unprecedented institutional demand. ETFs have purchased 1,368,980 ETH this month, compared to only 72,513 ETH minted, effectively buying 18 months’ worth of supply in just three weeks. This supply shock coincides with extreme bearish positioning in CME futures reaching -13,236 contracts, creating substantial fuel for short-covering rallies. Currently trading at $3,708, Ethereum has broken above key resistance levels around $2,600-$2,700 and is approaching the critical $4,000 zone that separates consolidation from explosive breakout territory. Source: TradingView Technical analysis reveals that ETH has been within a massive broadening wedge formation since 2023, with the current positioning testing the upper boundary of this formation. Combined with extreme short positioning and record ETF inflows, the confluence suggests Ethereum may be entering the acceleration phase toward new all-time highs above $4,878. Broadening Wedge Breakout Targets $4,800 Ethereum’s weekly chart reveals a massive broadening wedge formation with expanding oscillations that typically precede explosive breakouts. Currently testing the upper boundary around $3,742, ETH approaches the critical $4,000 resistance, which represents the key breakout level of the pattern. $ETH is just one God candle away from the biggest breakout. Once that happens, ETH will pump straight above the previous ATH. It seems like another mic-drop moment is coming for @EricTrump . pic.twitter.com/Unti8pPVXi — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) July 26, 2025 The ascending trendline provides crucial support, while horizontal resistance must be overcome for the major breakout scenario. The mathematical structure suggests that compressed energy exists within the formation, which could produce explosive movements once the upper boundary breaks decisively. Projection targets of $4,800 indicate a measured move potential, calculated from the wedge width, representing approximately 30% upside from current levels. The current positioning suggests ETH is completing the final consolidation phase before resolution toward much higher targets that could exceed previous all-time highs above $4,878. Ethereum Price Prediction: Extreme Short Positioning Fuels Covering Rally CME Ethereum futures data reveals unprecedented bearish positioning reaching -13,236 contracts, representing the most extreme short interest in the dataset’s history. Source: Wise Advice on X This capitulation-level positioning typically precedes significant upward moves as forced covering accelerates price gains. Even modest upward moves could trigger cascading short covering that accelerates gains beyond normal technical resistance. Recent momentum shows “a record-setting 9 daily candles” followed by minimal corrections, describing patterns characteristic of strong trending moves. This progression from support levels through resistance breakouts illustrates methodical institutional accumulation, with foundations being built at each level. The $4,000 target for “end of month” appears achievable given current momentum and short covering, providing additional upward pressure beyond normal buying demand as extreme positioning unwinds. $ETH – #Ethereum will inevitably break its all-time high. pic.twitter.com/hT1vmtWBI1 — Crypto Caesar (@CryptoCaesarTA) July 25, 2025 Snorter: Last Days to Join $2 Presale Success Ethereum’s approach to breaking out above $4,000 and potentially accelerating to $4,800 targets creates ideal conditions for advanced trading strategies. Snorter’s $SNORT token presale has raised over $2 million, with limited allocation remaining before the window closes permanently ahead of Q3 2025 mainnet launch. Early investors are securing final positions in the Telegram-native trading bot positioned for explosive market conditions. The $SNORT token unlocks multiple revenue streams through the expanding ecosystem. Staking rewards reach up to 207% APY for early participants, while reduced trading fees at 0.85% provide ongoing advantages during high-volume trading periods. Token holders gain governance rights and early access to new launches, creating additional value beyond basic trading functionality. Market projections estimate that $SNORT could reach $0.65 by late 2025, driven by the adoption of utility during periods of increased trading volumes.

This reversal has taken the market by surprise, with the altcoin market, once again, bearing the brunt of the losses. Now, as the Bitcoin price reaches an important level, the questions of whether this is the start of a bear trend or if there will be a bounce in price have become more urgent. Bitcoin Trends Low After New Highs After the reversal back into the $117,000 levels, crypto analyst TehThomas has published an analysis outlining the current Bitcoin price trend and where it could be headed next. So far, the analyst explains that Bitcoin is still trading in a well-defined trend after being rejected from the upper resistance zone at $120,000 multiple times. However, there is still a lot of bite from its support levels below, which could be its saving grace. Related Reading: Cup And Saucer Pattern Says XRP Price Rally Is Not Done As the analyst explains, the fact that the support continues to hold shows that there is still a lot of buying going on for Bitcoin. This puts the support very tight around this area, but also makes it a dangerous territory for the bulls. It is possible that there is a sweep back to these lows, and Thomas explains that such a move would engineer sell-side liquidity. There is also a Fair Value Gap (FVG) at the $121,000 level, which continues to be defended. This is where most of the resistance has come from, pushing the price back below $118,000 multiple times already. Thus, this FVG is the next level to reclaim in the campaign for new highs. Bouncing Back From Lows If the sweep back toward the lows is completed, it is not entirely bearish for the Bitcoin price and could, in fact, be the move that helps to trigger the next wave of uptrend. The analyst explains that buyers would have to step back in at this level, with support sitting firmly at $116,000. This accumulation during consolidation would be inherently bullish. Related Reading: Tether Investments Extend Beyond Bitcoin Amid Record Profits — Details Looking back at the FVG, the analyst explains that it could act as a magnet if the price begins to rise again. Nevertheless, all of this depends on the Bitcoin price dipping back to support and then bouncing off again. The sweep of liquidity at the lows and the bounce would offer confirmation that the price is going to keep trending upward. However, there is still the possibility of a price breakdown from here. Thomas points to an invalidation of the bullish thesis if support at $116,000 fails to hold and there is no immediate recovery. “Bitcoin remains locked in a clear range, and until the breakout happens, the edges of that range offer the best trading opportunities,” the analyst explained.

Bitcoin researcher and investor ‘Smitty’ has created a model calculating how much BTC is needed to retire on. “Most people in most countries still need less than 1 BTC for 2035 [retirement],” he stated before adding that if retiring this year, most countries need between one and ten BTC.

Their idea is to leverage the global trend of increased adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. Currently, NA has a segment focused on holding, managing, and expanding its BTC assets. This formal status requires board-level oversight and controls integrated into public filings, as crypto is heavily regulated in China. As of recently, NA holds approximately 400 BTC , valued at around $40 million. On top of that, NA expanded its crypto holdings by buying 120,000 Binance (BNB) tokens. That amounts to a combined"

2025-07-26 10:53:25+00:00,Ripple vs SEC or XRP Holders? Ex-SEC Answers Buzzing Question As Case Awaits Final Whistle,"Recent developments have triggered unease among XRP holders, not because of any court ruling or regulatory announcement, but due to concerns about Ripple’s political affiliations. Questions about whether Ripple’s actions serve the interests of XRP holders are now gaining traction, as political donations by Ripple’s leadership come under public scrutiny once again. Community Reactions to Ripple’s Political Support Some community members recently drew attention to donations made by Ripple executives to Kamala Harris’ campaign during the 2024 presidential race. Chris Larsen contributed over $11 million to the campaign , making him the top donor from the crypto industry. This news provoked frustrations among community members at the time, and those tensions have reemerged. Donald Trump has consistently shown support for cryptocurrencies, promising to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. He accepted crypto donations during his campaign and actively engaged with crypto holders. Larsen’s decision to support Harris did not sit well with many community members who saw Trump as the better candidate for the crypto industry. Some now re-evaluate their long-term support for Ripple, viewing the donations as a sign that the company may not represent their values or financial interests. One crypto user recently highlighted these frustrations, suggesting that XRP holders should dump their tokens if XRP reaches $3.5 again and buy Bitcoin if it crosses $125,000. Former SEC Lawyer Weighs In He also drew attention to the XRP lawsuit, arguing that Joe Biden’s administration held XRP down while Gary Gensler aggressively pursued the crypto market. He called Ripple two-faced for cozying up to Trump after the election despite the support its executives accorded Harris, who shared Biden’s views. Marc Fagel, a former SEC attorney, intervened to address the issue. He clarified that the enforcement action against Ripple was filed under the Trump administration, during Jay Clayton’s tenure as SEC Chair. Fagel explained that Gary Gensler, who took over as SEC Chair months later, had no role in initiating the case. Ripple was sued under the Trump/Clayton administration, long before Gensler was appointed. Basic facts, sorry. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 24, 2025 Fagel previously noted that it was irrelevant that Clayton signed off on the lawsuit on his final day in office, as the investigation began long before then.

2025-07-26 10:55:10+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Soars: An Unprecedented Triumph Above $118,000","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Price Soars: An Unprecedented Triumph Above $118,000 Imagine waking up to news that Bitcoin, the world’s leading cryptocurrency, has achieved an astonishing milestone. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC has reportedly risen above the monumental mark of $118,000, trading specifically at $118,006.77 on the Binance USDT market. This reported Bitcoin price surge marks an unprecedented moment in the digital asset’s journey, captivating investors and enthusiasts worldwide. What does this historic achievement signify for the future of finance, and what factors could possibly propel Bitcoin to such stratospheric heights? Let’s delve into the details of this extraordinary development and its far-reaching implications. What’s Behind the Monumental Bitcoin Price Surge? When we witness such an astonishing leap in Bitcoin price , it’s natural to wonder about the underlying forces at play. A rally of this magnitude is rarely the result of a single factor; instead, it’s often a confluence of macroeconomic trends, technological advancements, and shifting investor sentiment. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone trying to navigate the volatile yet exciting world of cryptocurrencies. Several key elements typically contribute to significant upward movements in Bitcoin’s value: Institutional Adoption: A major catalyst for any substantial Bitcoin price increase is the growing interest and investment from large financial institutions. When major corporations, asset managers, and even sovereign wealth funds begin allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, it signals a powerful vote of confidence. This influx of capital not only boosts demand but also lends legitimacy to the asset class, attracting more mainstream investors. Halving Events: Bitcoin’s supply is capped at 21 million coins, and its new supply is periodically cut in half through ‘halving’ events. These events reduce the reward miners receive for validating transactions, thereby slowing down the rate at which new Bitcoins enter circulation. Historically, halving events have preceded significant price rallies due to the basic economic principle of reduced supply meeting constant or increasing demand. Macroeconomic Climate: Global economic conditions often play a significant role. In times of inflation or economic uncertainty, traditional safe-haven assets like gold might see increased demand. Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as ‘digital gold’ by many, offering a decentralized alternative that is not subject to the monetary policies of any single government. This perception can drive significant investment, pushing the Bitcoin price upwards. Technological Advancements and Network Upgrades: Continuous development within the Bitcoin network, such as improvements in scalability (e.g., the Lightning Network) or enhanced security features, can increase its utility and appeal. A more robust and efficient network attracts more users and applications, reinforcing its value proposition. Increased Retail Participation: While institutional money provides large capital injections, widespread retail interest fuels momentum. Easier access to cryptocurrency exchanges, improved user interfaces, and increased public awareness can lead to a surge in individual investors buying Bitcoin, contributing to its upward trajectory. Is This Bitcoin Price Rally Sustainable? The question on every investor’s mind following such an impressive surge in Bitcoin price is whether this momentum can be sustained. The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, with sharp corrections often following rapid gains. Evaluating sustainability requires a closer look at market fundamentals, investor behavior, and potential headwinds. Sustainability in the crypto market is complex. While the factors driving the current surge are powerful, potential challenges always exist: Market Corrections: No asset moves in a straight line forever. Profit-taking by early investors and large holders (whales) can lead to significant pullbacks. These corrections are a natural part of market cycles, helping to ‘reset’ valuations and absorb excess exuberance. Regulatory Scrutiny: Governments worldwide are increasingly turning their attention to regulating the cryptocurrency space. While clear regulations can bring stability and legitimacy, overly restrictive or uncertain regulatory environments can dampen investor enthusiasm and impact the Bitcoin price . Global Economic Headwinds: Unexpected economic downturns, interest rate hikes, or geopolitical tensions can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, potentially causing outflows from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Competition from Altcoins: While Bitcoin is dominant, the emergence of innovative altcoins with unique functionalities could, in the long term, divert some investment flows.

It suggests moving capital out of direct crypto exposure and into a new class of corporate shells that act as synthetic crypto proxies. While Wood mentions Ethereum and Robinhood, Ark has aggressively trimmed its holdings in Coinbase, HOOD, and Block. This comes in when Ethereum has gained more than 50% in the last 30 days. ETH price went to breach $3,800. Data shows that Ethereum’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) jumped by more than 37% over the last month to stand at $82.88 billion. It has finally outperformed Solana. This depicts an uptrend for staking on the Ether chain. Is this Crypto’s new leverage cycle? In an X post, Cathie Wood mentioned that Robinhood is offering a 2% match for crypto transfers. Looking at this chance, “VCs and other investors shifting staked ETH into Treasury companies (DATs) to double their money when lockups expire,” she added. This essentially incentivizes users to treat its platform like a yield-enhanced crypto vault. Behind the scenes, staked ETH is quietly being shifted into corporate entities like Bitmine (BMNR). Here, they can command outsized premiums due to legacy market inefficiencies. Wood added that advisors can give clients exposure to BTC and ETH via this. Source: Cathie Wood’s X . Brett Winton, ARK’s Chief Futurist, flagged a deeper concern over the sudden spike in Ethereum unstaking. “What’s the most economical explanation for the surge in ETH unstaking demand?” he asked in a post. “Does the staked supply chart already factor in queued withdrawals or are we headed for more downward pressure?” Winton describes the broader game at play as a classic leverage cycle. For a time, you can wrap $0.50 worth of crypto in a corporate shell and sell it to the market for $1. That arbitrage attracts more capital, and eventually the underlying assets lose liquidity or appeal. Suddenly, that $0.50 is only worth $0.25, sparking a cascade of forced selling and distressed debt workouts. Source: DeFiLlama Data. It’s a phenomenon that has echoes of 2008 financial engineering, and now it’s playing out on the rails of crypto. He highlighted that as long as these treasury stocks trade at a premium to net asset value (NAV), issuers can mint new shares. However, users can take on debt and buy more crypto. Cathi Wood’s Ark bets big on Ethereum’s shadow stocks Wood’s and the top executive’s words suggest that Ark isn’t abandoning crypto, it’s just evolving with the market. There’s no shortage of bullish catalysts, and thanks to legislative wins like the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts. According to the recent trading disclosure, Ark acquired roughly 4.4 million shares of BMNR across its ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF ETFs. At BMNR’s closing price of $39.8, this investment is approaching $175 million. However, Wood’s team also shed 218,986 shares of Coinbase (approx. worth $90.6 million), along with major cuts to Robinhood (approx. worth $11.46 million).

2025-07-26 11:00:28+00:00,Massive Bitcoin Exchange Moves Hint at Market Shake-Up: Surge or Plunge Incoming?,"Bitcoin’s recent rally appears to be losing momentum, with the asset slipping by 2.4% over the past week and currently trading around $115,382. This marks a 6.1% drop from its all-time high above $123,000 reached earlier this month. While the decline has yet to indicate a confirmed trend reversal, on-chain data is signaling increased market activity and positioning as traders respond to the pullback. Exchange Activity Points to Market Repositioning According to data shared by CryptoQuant contributor Enigma Trader, recent inflows and outflows from exchanges are helping shape market sentiment. In a post titled “Massive Inflows Spark BTC Dump — But Outflows Return,” the analyst highlighted that a notable inflow spike on July 17, totaling more than 32,000 BTC, signaled heightened sell-side pressure. The result was a sharp price decline, with Bitcoin temporarily dropping below $115,000. However, outflows have returned in recent days, raising the possibility of renewed accumulation . Enigma Trader noted that following the major inflow event, Bitcoin experienced a series of significant outflows across several days, totaling -7,400 BTC, -12,080 BTC, and -16,100 BTC. These outflows, which typically represent a shift from exchanges to wallets, may reflect either investor repositioning or an intent to hold, both of which reduce immediate selling pressure. The analyst suggested that if the outflow trend continues while Bitcoin remains near support, there could be potential for a bullish turnaround, especially if momentum is sustained. Supporting this view, historical patterns often show that sustained outflows correspond with increased investor confidence and longer-term holding behavior . Still, such behavior must be weighed against broader market conditions, including macroeconomic factors, risk sentiment, and regulatory developments. The current dynamic shows a balance between cautious optimism and short-term volatility. Record Open Interest Signals Speculative Activity Meanwhile, CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain pointed out another layer to Bitcoin’s current market structure: open interest in Bitcoin derivatives has reached a new record high of $44.5 billion. Interestingly, this spike in open interest occurred as prices fell, indicating that many traders are initiating new positions during the dip. The analyst emphasized that while some may be placing long positions expecting a recovery, a considerable portion likely represents short bets on further downside. This combination, rising open interest during a declining price trend, raises the risk of liquidation events, especially if the market reverses direction abruptly. Arab Chain warned that high open interest under such conditions often suggests increased leverage use by speculators rather than long-term investors. This makes the market more sensitive to volatility, and sharp movements in either direction could trigger a cascade of liquidations.

2025-07-26 11:08:33+00:00,3 Best Cryptos to Buy That Could Flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC in the Next Bull Run,"The post 3 Best Cryptos to Buy That Could Flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC in the Next Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sometimes, all it takes is a penny investment. That’s the philosophy many early Bitcoin believers followed back in 2011. Now, seasoned crypto traders are looking to repeat history as BTC pushes past $130,000, attention shifts from chasing highs to finding the next big breakout coin. Analysts believe the real gains lie in the undervalued tokens still trading under a cent, with enough traction and upside to flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC by the next bull peak. Here’s why these tokens could be the best to do precisely that. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Chain With Layer-2 Power A trader who rode Bitcoin from the 2022 bottom to this year’s peak is now rotating gains into Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — a low-cap Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Layer-2 token currently in Stage 7 of its presale. At $0.0017, it has already climbed over 50% from its early-stage pricing, with $8.9 million raised and 6.7 billion tokens sold. Analysts believe that a jump to around $0.20 seems possible once the token lists. Stage 6 of the presale was gone in a flash, and Stage 7 is moving just as fast, showing that every second may count for new buyers. Instead of loading up on Bitcoin again, this move suggests a larger plan: using steady wins from top coins to free up cash for riskier, high-reward projects. And Little Pepe fits that mold — not just for its fast Layer-2 network, but for its emphasis on community-first culture, sniper bot protection, and an innovative meme launchpad (Pump Pad). Its $777,000 giveaway, open to anyone contributing $100+ in the presale, has pulled in over 40,000 entries. The project’s visibility on CoinMarketCap and a strong Freshcoin.io audit score of 81.55 further validate its appeal. Most notably, its confirmed listing price of $0.003 means early buyers are looking at a guaranteed 2.14x return, even before price discovery. Floki Inu (FLOKI): The Viking Doge That’s Building Beyond Memes FLOKI might not be under-the-radar anymore — but it’s far from done. What began as a meme homage to Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu has matured into a serious Web3 ecosystem. Its developers have rolled out DeFi tools, NFT integrations, and a metaverse platform. Recent traction in meme coin trading and broader crypto recovery helped FLOKI regain attention, but the mix of utility and culture keeps it in play. FLOKI’s partnerships across multiple chains — from Ethereum to Binance Smart Chain — and its aggressive marketing campaign make it one to watch for both short-term spikes and long-term protocol adoption. While it’s no longer in the sub-million-dollar range like LILPEPE, the team’s push toward real features — combined with meme loyalty — could help it outperform many larger-cap coins in the next cycle. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): The NFT Mascot That Just Might Become a Meme Coin Giant PENGU trades around $0.021 with a $1.3 billion market cap, and while that puts it above early-stage tokens, its unique crossover position gives it enormous speculative power. Launched alongside its successful NFT series, Pudgy Penguins is tapping into mainstream adoption. It recently secured a decentralized ETF (Canary PENGU ETF), with listings on Revolut and Bitstamp, that pushed it into headlines. But what truly powers PENGU is its cultural relevance. From branded toys to community-driven storytelling, it’s become a household meme brand with global NFT traction. During one week alone, PENGU rallied over 80%, and with fresh exchange listings and ETF visibility, it’s becoming a case study for how memes, NFTs, and finance can collide. Conclusion: Timing Beats Talent in the Crypto Game The difference between a trader who 10x’d 0.1 BTC and one who didn’t isn’t always technical skill; most times it’s timing, conviction, and being early. While Bitcoin’s path to $140K might offer steady returns, exponential growth often lies with new narratives. Little Pepe’s explosive presale, Floki’s blend of meme and DeFi, and Pudgy Penguin’s brand power offer three roads to significant upside. For those looking to turn small bets into headline-worthy wins, these aren’t just coins, they’re chances. Now might be the time to act — before the rest of the market catches up.

The post 3 Best Cryptos to Buy That Could Flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC in the Next Bull Run appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Sometimes, all it takes is a penny investment. That’s the philosophy many early Bitcoin believers followed back in 2011. Now, seasoned crypto traders are looking to repeat history as BTC pushes past $130,000, attention shifts from chasing highs to finding the next big breakout coin. Analysts believe the real gains lie in the undervalued tokens still trading under a cent, with enough traction and upside to flip 0.1 BTC into 10 BTC by the next bull peak. Here’s why these tokens could be the best to do precisely that. Little Pepe (LILPEPE): The Meme Chain With Layer-2 Power A trader who rode Bitcoin from the 2022 bottom to this year’s peak is now rotating gains into Little Pepe (LILPEPE) — a low-cap Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Layer-2 token currently in Stage 7 of its presale. At $0.0017, it has already climbed over 50% from its early-stage pricing, with $8.9 million raised and 6.7 billion tokens sold. Analysts believe that a jump to around $0.20 seems possible once the token lists. Stage 6 of the presale was gone in a flash, and Stage 7 is moving just as fast, showing that every second may count for new buyers. Instead of loading up on Bitcoin again, this move suggests a larger plan: using steady wins from top coins to free up cash for riskier, high-reward projects. And Little Pepe fits that mold — not just for its fast Layer-2 network, but for its emphasis on community-first culture, sniper bot protection, and an innovative meme launchpad (Pump Pad).

2025-07-26 11:29:26+00:00,Next Crypto to Hit $1? This Token Entered Phase 6 and Might Overtake DOGE in ROI,"The post Next Crypto to Hit $1? This Token Entered Phase 6 and Might Overtake DOGE in ROI appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) continue their steady climbs, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the crypto crowd with a unique blend of innovation and growth potential. Now entering Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as the next moonshot candidate, with the ambition to outpace DOGE’s historical returns on investment. The limited availability in this phase combined with a thoughtfully engineered ecosystem is creating a perfect storm for a breakout run. Investors ready to seize this opportunity will find MUTM’s structure and roadmap hard to ignore. Stablecoin Depth and mtToken Staking: The Heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Design Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s decentralized stablecoin system will be built on a strict, controlled mint-and-burn model. Only authorized issuers will be able to mint stablecoins against blue-chip collateral such as ETH, and these stablecoins will be burned when borrowers repay their loans, ensuring the peg to $1 remains robust. Governance protocols will actively manage interest rates to maintain equilibrium, while automatic liquidations will protect the system from undercollateralization risks. This setup will foster a stable, reliable environment for both lenders and borrowers. What will truly set Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart is its innovative mtToken mechanism. When users deposit assets like USDC or ETH into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts, they will receive corresponding mtTokens 1:1. These mtTokens will grow in value over time as interest accumulates. Moreover, staking mtTokens will unlock an additional layer of rewards: stakers will earn MUTM tokens purchased through open market buybacks funded by protocol revenue. This design will effectively tie token utility to the platform’s success, creating a continuous incentive for participation while boosting MUTM’s demand and value. Presale Snapshot and a Roadmap Set for Growth Phase 6’s launch at $0.035 has already generated $13.60 million, though only 5% of tokens have been claimed so far. Phase 7 is expected to mint 170 million tokens at $0.040, marking a 15% price increase that adds urgency for investors eyeing early entry. The total supply is capped at 4 billion tokens, now held by over 14,400 wallets, reflecting a strong and growing community. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s security credentials are impressive. The project earned a CertiK audit with a Token Scan score of 95.00 and a Skynet score of 78.00, confirming a solid technical foundation. A $50,000 USDT bug bounty program actively invites ethical hackers to safeguard the platform, while a $100,000 giveaway across ten backers creates additional community excitement. The project roadmap is equally compelling. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 6 Beta will launch concurrently with the token listing, unveiling the mint/burn stablecoin system alongside an automated rate engine that adjusts borrowing costs dynamically. Further phases promise cross-chain support, facilitating asset transfers beyond Ethereum’s network. Crucially, Layer 2 integration will slash transaction costs to near zero and speed execution to under a second, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s platform both efficient and scalable. Lending Mechanics that Appeal to Both Cautious and Risk-Tolerant Investors Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will expertly balance low-risk and higher-risk lending through its dual models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model will invite depositors to lend blue-chip tokens at competitive rates. For example, lending 2 BTC at a 9% APY will mint 240,000mtBTC tokens that will grow by 0.18 BTC annually. These mtBTC will be stakeable to collect additional MUTM rewards generated from protocol buybacks. Borrowers using P2C will be able to leverage their BTC collateral to draw 70% loan-to-value in stablecoins like USDT, allowing liquidity without selling assets. In contrast, the P2P model will cater to higher-risk appetite by facilitating direct loan agreements involving memecoins such as SHIB. Investors will be able to negotiate loans—say, a 45-day SHIB loan at 32% APR—isolating these volatile assets from core pools and rewarding lenders with premium interest. Investor Case and Growing FOMO: The Clock Is Ticking History tends to repeat itself in crypto, and a seasoned investor who famously predicted DOGE’s 2020 rally is placing his bets on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). He swapped $5,000 worth of ETH into MUTM at just $0.015, acquiring 333,333 tokens valued at $11,666 today. This amount will jump to $20,000 at the listing price of $0.06. More thrilling is the forecasted surge to $1 per token, a staggering 100× gain, pushing his holdings to a remarkable $333,333. This optimistic price prediction is driven by the increasing MUTM demand driven by upcoming beta launch and real testing of platform usage.

Goldman’s survey indicates investors are expressing increased bullishness on US stocks, particularly on Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia, the large tech firms that make up the “Magnificent Seven.” Conversely, the same institutional investors are demonstrating a surge in bearishness on the dollar amid US fiscal issues. Oscar Östlund, a managing director at Goldman, notes that dollar bears now outnumber bulls by a ratio of more than 7:1. “One of the most important paradigm shifts over the last couple of months has been the decoupling of the dollar and US equities.” Source: Goldman Sachs Goldman’s investor survey has only clocked bearish dollar sentiment next to a bullish view on US stocks three times in the past 9.5 years. In terms of stocks, 51% of Goldman’s respondents were bullish on the S&P 500, while 32% were bearish. Östlund says that equity bullishness could suggest market vulnerability to a reversal. “A very one-sided position is a sign of a stretched market.

ETF Flows Take Center Stage In Bitcoin Uptrend According to Citi analysts, spot Bitcoin ETFs now explain over 40% of the recent price swings.

That jump in adoption would support roughly $75,000 of price strength on its own. The idea is simple. More users mean more hands holding and trading Bitcoin. That activity tends to make prices less prone to sudden drops. Still, forecasts like this rest on the assumption that new users stick around rather than flipping coins for quick gains. Macroeconomic Factors Cut Forecast Slightly Citi’s model also factors in weaker performance in equities and gold, trimming the price by about $3,200. That adjustment reflects a view that if stock and metal markets struggle, Bitcoin won’t fully decouple from broader risk assets. At the same time, growing regulatory approval and deeper links between crypto and traditional finance should offer some support. ETF Demand Could Lift Bitcoin By $63,000 In the base‑case scenario, Citi adds the $63,000 from ETF flows to the $75,000 from user growth, then subtracts $3,200 for macro headwinds. That math lands the price at about $135,000 in 2025. That figure is only $12,000 above the recent peak of $123,000.

That level of institutional backing is unprecedented. It shifts Bitcoin’s fate more toward big‑money flows than pure retail hype. Featured image from Pexels, chart from TradingView"
2025-07-26 12:00:51+00:00,"Senator Warren Slams Crypto ‘Industry-Designed’ Bills, Says American People Will ‘Pay The Price’","US Senator Elizabeth Warren has slammed the Trump administration and the recently passed crypto bill focusing on stablecoin regulation, arguing that the American people will pay the price for “industry-designed” legislation. US Lawmakers Must Get Legislation Right In a Vanity Fair interview , Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump a week ago during the House of Representatives’ “Crypto Week.” Introduced in February by Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, the GENIUS Act establishes a framework that will allow stablecoins to fall under the Federal Reserve Rules, creating a “safe and pro-growth” regulatory structure to advance the US digital assets industry. When asked about the number of Democrats who supported the bill , Warren explained that “there’s been a long, bipartisan tradition of helping out industry instead of doing what the American people have called for: unrigging the economy and making life more affordable.” The crypto-skeptic senator affirmed that she agrees that strong digital assets legislation is needed, but that pushing what she deems “industry-designed” bills is a mistake. “If we’re going to ratify a sweeping crypto regulatory framework, we need to get it right,” she argued. According to the senator, the industry’s “influence” in Washington was expected, as it is a city where “money talks.” As reported by Bitcoinist, Super Political Action Committees (PACs) have spent hundreds of millions over the past few years. A recent report revealed that Fairshake, the largest Super PAC, and its affiliates invested around $136 million in supporting nearly 60 pro-crypto candidates during the 2024 election cycle, and “are well-prepared for the 2026 midterms, boasting over $100 million in resources.” Warren asserted that the sectors’ spending on lobbying has “blown through anything that Washington has seen before,” which resulted in the digital assets industry writing “its own legislation.” Warren compared the GENIUS Act to the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, affirming that when Washington works for industries, only a handful of people get rich, while the American people “pay the price.” We’ve seen that movie before, when the industry writes its own legislation. (…) When the derivatives industry (…) came to Washington and said, ‘Here’s a bill, please regulate us,’ and handed the legislators a bill that weakly regulated the industry and gave it the appearance of the US government’s backing. The consequence was the crash of 2008 that cost 10 million American families their homes and more their jobs and their savings. Sen. Warren Slams Trump’s Crypto Pivot Warren also reaffirmed her stance on the Trump administration’s shift to pro-industry legislation to allegedly benefit himself. To the Democratic senator, the US President is “using the presidency to enrich himself through crypto, and he’s doing it in plain sight.” Previously, she raised concerns about President Trump’s crypto ventures, arguing that they could pave the way for potential “crypto corruption.” In May, the lawmaker urged Congress to reject the GENIUS Act despite bipartisan efforts to amend the legislation to address the concerns of Senate Democrats. During the interview, Warren also criticized the US President for appointing industry insiders to “run crypto policy,” disbanding the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) enforcement unit, and asking the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to pivot from its “regulation by enforcement” approach from the previous administration. “People who voted for Trump sent him to the White House because he promised lower costs on day one—not to turn the White House into a crypto cash machine,” she concluded. Despite the senator’s concerns, some industry players consider that the regulatory shift and the GENIUS Act will be positive for the American digital assets industry. MARA Holdings CEO, Fred Thiel, recently stated that the recently passed legislation shows the US is taking a leadership position globally, and it will be “very helpful for providing trust” to the sector while allowing the market to “move much freer.”",bitcoinist,https://bitcoinist.com/senator-warren-slams-crypto-industry-designed-bills-says-american-people-will-pay-the-price/,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK|AIRDROP|XLM|LTC|CFX|FLOKI|MX|COMMODITY|ONDO|ENA,Crypto News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto industry|Crypto legislation|Crypto Market|Elizabeth Warren|GENIUS Act|President Donald Trump|Stablecoin Legislation|Stablecoins|Super PACs|US Senator Warren,BTC,"Senator Warren Slams Crypto ‘Industry-Designed’ Bills, Says American People Will ‘Pay The Price’.

2025-07-26 12:08:57+00:00,"AI sets date when Bitcoin will crash below $100,000","An artificial intelligence (AI) tool has suggested that, despite Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current bullish run, there is a plausible chance the asset could crash below $100,000 in the coming weeks. According to OpenAI’s ChatGPT , Bitcoin, currently around $117,000, is hovering near critical support at $116,000. A breakdown below this level could send it to $105,000 and $108,000, with sub-$100,000 levels possible by August or early September 2025 if support fails. The AI model highlighted key risks that could accelerate a Bitcoin sell-off, including a slowdown in spot ETF inflows and a broader U.S. market correction. Notably, Bitcoin ETF inflows have been a key factor in the asset’s momentum, contributing to the record high of over $123,000. At the close of trading on June 25, the spot Bitcoin ETFs saw an inflow of $130.8 million. At the same time, as reported by Finbold, Citi analysts predict a base case of $135,000 for Bitcoin by the end of 2025 if inflows persist; however, the bank also warned that the asset could crash to as low as $64,000. ChatGPT also noted that both scenarios could put additional pressure on Bitcoin prices, especially as the cryptocurrency’s correlation with the S&P 500 has increased in recent months. Further downside could also stem from unpredictable events such as exchange hacks or sudden regulatory crackdowns, which have historically triggered panic sell-offs. The AI model emphasized that, although the exact timing remains uncertain, investors should be aware of a 30% to 40% probability that Bitcoin could fall below $100,000 between August and September 2025.

Notably, there is strong liquidity below the $116,000 level, which has been tested multiple times, suggesting buyers are actively defending the zone. Therefore, if Bitcoin can establish a stable base above $116,800, the market may target the $119,900 resistance zone. However, if BTC dips, the $110,000 to $112,000 range is highlighted as a prime accumulation zone, offering a potentially strong risk-reward opportunity for long-term investors.

The flagship cryptocurrency fell to a low of $114,770 on Friday as bearish sentiment peaked. However, it rebounded to reclaim $117,000, and currently trades around $117,307. Satoshi-Era Investor Cashes Out Via Galaxy Digital An early Bitcoin (BTC) investor has cashed out 80,000 BTC worth $9 billion at current prices through Galaxy Digital, completing what is being described as one of the largest notional transactions in crypto history. However, the details regarding the transaction have not been disclosed. The sale disclosure appeared in an announcement late on Friday, followed by a post on Galaxy Digital’s official blog. Galaxy Digital has not revealed the client’s identity, but stated that it was “part of the investor’s broader real estate planning strategy.” The announcement came after a day of heightened volatility for Bitcoin , with the asset’s price briefly dropping below $115,000 on Friday. Lookonchain data revealed several large transactions from Galaxy Digital throughout Friday, with most of the funds sent directly to exchanges. All the transactions were tied to the investor who moved over 80,000 BTC from a wallet that was dormant for 14 years. BTC rebounded after Friday’s drop below $115,000, with analysts noting that the market has already absorbed the entire sale. Joe Consorti, Head of Growth at Theya, stated, “80,000 BTC , over $9 billion, was sold into open market order books, and bitcoin barely moved.” Bitcoin (BTC) Could Reach $135,000 By Year-End Citigroup has predicted that Bitcoin (BTC) could reach $135,000 by the end of the year in its best-case scenario. According to Citigroup analysts, strong demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs, favorable macroeconomic trends, and growing user adoption could fuel the flagship cryptocurrency’s rally. Bitcoin is trading between $115,000 and $120,000 over the past week, showing resilience despite mixed economic data. The prediction has sparked optimism among investors and highlights Wall Street’s growing confidence in the leading cryptocurrency. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has recovered from Friday’s low as it reclaimed $117,000 and moved to $117,565. Despite the recovery, it remains in the red during the ongoing session, with the price marginally down. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has recovered over the past 24 hours, up nearly 2%. Analysts believe the price will pull back towards the $115,000 mark if current market trends continue, marking a 6% decline from recent all-time highs. However, they pointed out that the correction remains well within the normal volatility range observed in previous bull phases. This indicates the decline is part of a healthy market reset rather than a deeper correction. BTC registered a sharp drop last Tuesday (July 15), dropping to a low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682. It recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 1% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as the price registered a marginal increase and settled at $119,101. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Friday, dropping 1.03% to $117,877.

With increasing real-world use cases, institutional interest, and strategic partnerships, many are closely tracking HBAR price prediction 2025 to gauge how high the token can rise. With major companies like Google, IBM, and Chainlink Labs backing the project, and talks of an HBAR ETF approval, many are asking: Will HBAR Price Hit $1?

All-time low. $0.01001 (January 2nd, 2020). Hedera Price Analysis: H1 2025 Hedera experienced a volatile first half of 2025. After peaking at $0.40 in mid-January, the HBAR price began a steady decline. External factors and waning investor engagement were evident in the TVL, which contributed to this downturn. Ultimately, HBAR was pushed into a converging falling wedge pattern, hitting a low of $0.125 in early April. However, the tide began to turn in the second week of April. A broader crypto rally provided a much-needed lift for HBAR, breaking free from the wedge and bouncing off a robust support zone that had previously fueled a rally in Q4 2024. This zone, validated by the Fixed Range Volume Profile (FRVP) indicator, indicated strong buying interest and set the stage for a sharp rebound. In a remarkable surge, HBAR climbed nearly 80%, rising from $0.125 to $0.228 between April and mid-May. Unfortunately, this momentum was short-lived, as geopolitical tensions escalated in mid-May, causing HBAR’s price to retreat back to its April lows, forming another parallel declining wedge on the chart. By the end of June, HBAR remained within that channel but started to see bears losing grip to bulls, when entering July, momentum blasted, breaking the upper border of the parallel channel. Hedera Price Targets July 2025 Precisely in July, from the declining parallel channel, Hedera saw strong demand starting from $0.125 in late June to July 18th, where HBAR spiked 135% to $0.30, piercing through all short-term and long-term EMA bands. This movement followed a boost from the ceasefire announcement in late June and was further bolstered by Bitcoin hitting an all-time high of $123,231. But, the crypto sector saw short-term profit booking, not even HBAR was spared by the bears. But this profit booking seems healthy, as it has not broken the 20-day EMA’s dynamic support, indicating the strength is intact in the overall trend and marking it as a cooldown phase before another potential rally. If the bulls regain strength, then in the rest of July, it may aim for $0.30 level’s retest again and flipping it with a daily close could potentially open doors next month for a retest of the $0.34 and $0.40 resistance. Month Potential Low Potential Average Potential High HBAR Price Prediction July 2025 $0.125 $0.27 $0.40 Hedera Price Prediction 2025 (H2) Looking ahead, if the momentum persists, HBAR price might even reach $0.75 by year-end. However, on the downside, failing to maintain the $0.190 support zone could pull it down towards multi-month support at $0.125. Below this level, the price could even drop toward $0.072. Also, while TVL was previously down, it has witnessed a resurgence, with investor trust reflected in TVL increasing from $75 million to $114 million within the last 30 days. Hedera’s internal developments also tell a promising story. The ecosystem continues to expand, with the launch of its first native hardware wallet, Citadel , and an AI-based tool called the Hedera Agent Kit , which simplifies token creation. Another significant project, HashSphere, is set to launch in Q3 2025, aiming to provide a private, regulated blockchain for stablecoin-based payments and asset management. Moreover, Hedera underwent a rebranding on May 15, with the HBAR Foundation now known as the Hedera Foundation and the Governing Council rebranded as the Hedera Council. This restructuring positions Hedera for a stronger future, signaling maturity within its ecosystem.

From massive bitcoin buys to major scams, upgrades, and unexpected exits, the stories came from every corner – exchanges, regulators, and even celebrities! If you’ve missed anything, don’t worry. Here’s a complete crypto roundup for you to get caught up on it all. Let’s dive in. #1 Trump Media Buys $2B in Bitcoin to Build Crypto Reserve Trump Media has officially joined the crypto treasury club. The company behind Truth Social confirmed a $2 billion investment in bitcoin and bitcoin-related assets. CEO Devin Nunes says the move is part of a long-term strategy to “help ensure our Company’s financial freedom” and support a future utility token for the platform. Another $300 million has been set aside for options tied to Bitcoin. The company also plans to explore crypto ETFs . #2 Ozzy Osbourne’s Death Triggers Scam Token Rush on Solana Just hours after Ozzy Osbourne passed away, Solana saw a flood of new memecoins using his name. At least 15 “OZZY” or “RIP Ozzy” tokens were launched – many of them scams. On-chain data shows 10 were confirmed rug pulls, draining around 1,625 SOL, or over $325,000, from investors. In most cases, liquidity was pulled within minutes. The trend mirrors other high-profile crypto scams tied to real-world events. As one report claims , “up to 98% of tokens on Pump.fun” are pump-and-dump schemes, though the platform strongly denies it. #3 New ‘Stretch’ Stock Gives Michael Saylor More Room to Buy BTC Michael Saylor isn’t slowing down! Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) has raised $2.8 billion through its new “Stretch” preferred stock offering, up from the original $500 million plan. The money will go straight into more Bitcoin, part of the company’s long-term “42/42” goal to raise $84 billion by 2027. This new stock comes with a flexible 9% monthly dividend, giving Strategy more control as crypto markets shift. With over 607,000 BTC already on its books, the company is doubling down even as critics warn that its debt-heavy strategy could carry major risk. #4 FTX Will Start Next Payout to Creditors on Sept. 30 FTX will begin its next round of creditor repayments on September 30, the bankrupt exchange said on Wednesday. The funds will be distributed through BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer. So far, FTX has already returned $6.2 billion after getting court approval for its repayment plan. The company also got permission to reduce its disputed claim reserve from $6.5B to $4.3B. Founder Sam Bankman-Fried is currently serving a 25-year sentence for fraud, but for creditors, the slow road to recovery continues. #5 Ripple CEO Warns of New YouTube Scam Ripple is once again warning its community as YouTube scams targeting XRP holders are on the rise. CEO Brad Garlinghouse posted on X this week, urging users to watch out for fake Ripple channels offering high-return airdrops. Like clockwork, with success and market rallies, scammers ramp up their attacks on the crypto community — PLEASE BEWARE of the latest scam targeting the XRP family on @YouTube and impersonating @Ripple ’s official account! We will keep reporting these – please do the same. As… https://t.co/WodO4ZUyW9 — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 23, 2025 The warning comes just days after XRP’s price dropped 10% from its recent high – a moment scammers appear to be using to their advantage. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also flagged a deepfake video promoting a fake 100M XRP giveaway. Investors are advised to avoid unknown links and double-check official accounts. #6 Justin Sun’s Tron Inc. Lists on Nasdaq Justin Sun’s Tron Inc. is now a public company. The firm joined the Nasdaq this week, not through a standard IPO, but by merging with SRM Entertainment – a U.S. toy maker that supplies Disney and Universal. Sun called the listing “a very big moment for the whole industry.” Tron Inc. now holds over $115 million worth of TRX tokens, and trading volume surged 36% after the news. #7 FBI Closes Case Against Kraken’s Jesse Powell Jesse Powell, co-founder of Kraken, is officially in the clear. The FBI has dropped its investigation into him, confirming no criminal charges will be filed. A declination letter from the Department of Justice also states that all seized laptops, phones, and crypto have been returned. The case was tied to a nonprofit dispute, not to Kraken or crypto. This clears the path for Powell to focus fully on Kraken again and it sends a strong signal that facts still matter in high-profile investigations. #8 Ethereum’s Next Big Upgrade May Arrive in November Ethereum developers are targeting a November launch for the Fusaka hard fork ,, which includes 11 proposals focused on security and scalability.

2025-07-26 12:35:09+00:00,Why Everyone’s Unstaking Ethereum? Cathie Wood Explains the Surge,"The post Why Everyone’s Unstaking Ethereum? Cathie Wood Explains the Surge appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum is making headlines again, not just for its price movement, but for a sudden spike in unstaking activity. According to Ark Invest’s Chief Futurist Brett Winton , the latest “Queue Wait Time” chart shows a sharp increase in users trying to withdraw their staked ETH. So, what’s causing this surge? Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood believes there are two key drivers behind this trend: Robinhood’s 2% crypto match offer and a shift of staked Ethereum into Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) companies. Let’s break it down. Robinhood’s New Crypto Offer: 2% Match Boosts Activity In a recent post on X, Cathie Wood pointed to Robinhood’s latest move as a major reason behind the unstaking activity. The platform is now offering a 2% bonus for users who transfer their crypto, including Ethereum and Bitcoin, to Robinhood wallets. This incentive is designed to attract crypto holders and bring more digital assets under Robinhood’s control. As a result, many users are unstaking their ETH to take advantage of the offer. The Rise of Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs) Beyond short-term offers, Cathie Wood highlights a more strategic trend: institutional investors and VCs are moving staked ETH into Digital Asset Treasury firms. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 26 July, 2025 , These companies, similar to MicroStrategy (MSTR), hold large amounts of crypto on their balance sheets. MicroStrategy, for example, owns over 607,770 BTC worth $71.35 billion, making it the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. The combined BTC holdings of all public companies stand at 897,086 BTC, valued at more than $105 billion. According to Wood, investors believe that by transferring ETH into DATs, they can potentially double their money, gaining exposure to crypto and benefiting from the rising stock prices of these firms. Why This Strategy Appeals to Traditional Financial Advisors For many financial advisors, direct crypto exposure is still limited by regulations. But buying stock in Treasury firms like MicroStrategy allows them to offer indirect crypto exposure to their clients. This is a key reason why more institutional players are opting for DATs. They see it as a smarter way to manage crypto within the bounds of traditional finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

They see it as a smarter way to manage crypto within the bounds of traditional finance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The token is showing resilience, sitting above key technical averages, but recent large token activity is drawing renewed scrutiny. Larsen Sells $200M XRP Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has offloaded over 100 million XRP tokens, worth around $200 million, during the recent price dip , adding pressure to the already shaky market. XRP fell by nearly 20%, touching $3.18 as of July 23. While some see this as a routine move, analysts warn that such large-scale selling, especially during market pullbacks, can worsen price drops. Chris Larsen (Ripple co-founder) still holds 2.58B $XRP — that’s $8.83B. If $200M was just the warm-up… what’s next? Don’t get dumped on. Don’t be the exit liquidity. Protect yourself. https://t.co/k152FXlm8N pic.twitter.com/T5CpTQjdDa — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) July 25, 2025 Larsen still holds a massive 2.58 billion XRP (about $7.9 billion), and experts like CryptoQuant’s J.A. Maartun believe more sales could be coming. This has raised concerns about how much influence major holders like Larsen have on XRP’s price action . Analysts tracked about $140 million of that going through centralized platforms, often a signal of forthcoming sales. XRP fell from its $3.66 high to below $3.16 in the same week. What Makes This Sell-Off Different? This isn’t Larsen’s first liquidation spree; he’s sold over 107 million XRP (valued at about $3.3 billion) since November. His fellow co-founder, Jed McCaleb, completed his orderly exit in 2022, but Larsen’s continued activity keeps pressure on market sentiment. Some observers see this pattern as strategic profit-taking built into the token’s early structure. Major seller activity near all-time highs, but not coordinated dumping, is historically normal for founder-held coins. Still, the scale raises concerns around micro-market influence. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse Explains Why Hidden Road Is Key to DeFi Growth , XRP Price Crash Ahead?

In a new thread on the social media platform X, the crypto analytics platform notes that tens of thousands of tokens have sprung to life during the month of July, meaning that early investors could be looking to take profits. “[Thursday] saw another wave of ancient coins move on-chain, with 3,900 BTC aged over 10 years becoming active.

Such activity from long-dormant supply often reflects internal reallocation, custodial shifts, or in some cases sell-side pressure.” Source: Glassnode/X According to Glassnode, the top crypto asset by market cap could still form a “bottom formation zone” if it fails to hold support. “The sharp rally from $110,000 to $117,000 created an on-chain air gap or a low-density accumulation zone. Since the $122,000 ATH (all-time high), price has held above it. If support fails, history shows such gaps can still evolve into bottom formation zones.” Source: Glassnode/X In its weekly on-chain analytics report, Glassnode details how BTC reaching a $1 trillion realized market cap is a monumental step for the flagship cryptocurrency. “Recent capital inflow has pushed Bitcoin’s realized cap above the $1 trillion mark for the first time. This is truly a monumental milestone for Bitcoin, highlighting its deep liquidity profile, and growing relevance on the macro stage. The larger Bitcoin becomes, the more capital can be stored within it, and the larger size can be settled via transactions.” Bitcoin’s realized market cap calculates the value of each coin at the price it was last transacted (on-chain), rather than the current market price. The metric aims to represent the “true” capital inflow into the BTC network. Bitcoin is trading for $116,671 at time of writing, a 2.1% decrease during the last 24 hours.

According to the details of the arrest, there were about 105 Indians and 81 Pakistanis. The international crackdown uncovered a vast trafficking and online fraud syndicate, with several victims being freed by authorities. According to the report, the arrest in Cambodia prompted Indian authorities to launch an investigation, led by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), into the cross-border digital crime network. In the documents released by ED, several fraud cases that have been tackled in the country have origins in scam centers throughout Southeast Asia , with Cambodia and Laos fingered as potential locations. These activities are always linked to the Golden Triangle, a notorious hub for illegal trafficking. Cambodia arrests individuals linked to a cybercrime network Investigations have revealed that numerous Indian citizens have been victims of this trafficking, with the perpetrators enticing them with the prospect of securing high-paying jobs for them abroad, especially in Singapore and Dubai. At the end of the day, most of them are trafficked to the locations where the groups carry out their digital scam . One victim, Manish Tomar from Uttar Pradesh, alleged that he was lured by Instagram influencer Bobby Kataria with a job offer in Singapore. Tomar said he ended up in Laos, and his passport was confiscated by Chinese nationals. He added that he was then taken to the Golden Triangle, where he was forced to take part in several investment scams and impersonation frauds. “He described a compound of 20–30 buildings guarded by armed private security, with translators to mediate between Chinese bosses and trafficked workers from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh,” the ED said in their note. Another victim, known as Paul, said he thought he was heading to Dubai for a job interview but found himself in a “digital arrest scam” center in Poim Phet in Cambodia. “There were guards trained in Muay Thai, armed with rifles. I was trained for seven days to impersonate a CBI officer. My job was to threaten victims in India, claiming they were involved in illegal activity,” Paul said. Paul admitted to scamming a person in Maharashtra of Rs. 75,000 ($900). In his detailed account, Paul mentioned that the scam centers operated in different units, but they were structured. “Line 1” would pretend to be from TRAI, while “Line 2” would impersonate police officers. “Line 3” acted as DCP-rank officers, offering fake help to their victims. Paul said he worked in Line 2, impersonating a police officer on WhatsApp video calls. The uniformed individual would lip-sync while he delivered the threats in multiple Indian languages. Furthermore, Paul said the syndicate used iPhones instead of computers to avoid IP tracking, and VOIP calls were routed through an app called Brian, with lines purchased from Thailand. He said the group specifically trained Pakistani nationals to impersonate Indian law enforcement, making it harder for Indian agencies to trace the fraud. Meanwhile, the ED said it is investigating a fraud network worth at least Rs. 159 crore (approximately $19.5 million). While most of the funds have been moved abroad via digital assets, the agency has been able to seize Rs. 3 crore ($360,000) from several Indian bank accounts. The ED also said it has secured the arrest of eight individuals for aiding in the creation of shell companies and laundering crime proceeds. Indian officials say the operation is a “ pig-butchering ” scam model where victims are being manipulated through various social platforms to invest in several digital assets and stock markets. Several high-profile losses have been connected to the crackdown in Cambodia. A woman reported that she was scammed out of Rs. 7.59 crore ($900,000) after investing in a bogus app. Another man lost Rs. 9.00 crore ($1.09 million), while a doctor lost Rs. 5.93 crore ($711,000).

CryptoQuant CEO Raises Big Questions appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A quiet $9 billion Bitcoin sale has now turned into a major controversy and it could be tied to one of the earliest crypto exchange hacks on record. This week, Galaxy Digital confirmed it sold 80,000 Bitcoin (worth over $9.4 billion) through over-the-counter (OTC) deals. But CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju says these coins may not belong to a long-term investor at all. Instead, they could be linked to the 2011 MyBitcoin exchange hack – a breach that, until now, had faded into crypto history. From a Dormant Wallet to a $9 Billion Payout “The recent transfer of 80,000 BTC, dormant for 14 years, came from wallets originally hosted by MyBitcoin,” Ju posted on X. These wallets had been inactive since April 2011, two months before MyBitcoin went offline following a hack. At the time, the exchange’s owner, Tom Williams, admitted the breach and said he was working on a resolution. The attack reportedly caused $72,000 in losses – a small figure by today’s standards, but if those coins were kept, they’re now worth billions. Ju believes the Bitcoins either belong to the hacker or to Williams himself, who disappeared from the public eye after the exchange collapsed. Did Galaxy Check Where the BTC Came From? Here’s where things get murky. Ju added, “It seems Galaxy Digital bought (handled) the #Bitcoin from them, but I’m not sure if they did any forensics.” Galaxy didn’t reveal the seller’s identity. Instead, the company described them as a “Satoshi-era investor”, someone from Bitcoin’s early days, and said the sale was part of estate planning. That explanation hasn’t convinced everyone. The lack of transparency is now raising concerns over whether Galaxy skipped proper checks before handling a historic pile of possibly hacked funds. *Galaxy handled the 80K BTC sale for them. pic.twitter.com/QE4hDbHUXt — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 26, 2025 Also Read: Coinpedia Digest: This Week’s Crypto News Highlights | 26 July, 2025 Bitcoin Price Holds Steady Despite the Drama What’s surprising is how calm the market stayed.

2025-07-26 13:43:00+00:00,Russian crypto traders under pressure from new laws,"Russia has been adopting and updating laws allowing it to target cryptocurrency transactions ahead of next year’s launch of its own coin, the digital ruble. The legislative changes make it harder for ordinary Russians to pay with or trade crypto, as operations like these can lead to account freezing, asset seizure and even criminal prosecution. Payment system law to hit peer-to-peer crypto trades in Russia The federal law “On the National Payment System” now empowers banks to restrict access to a client’s bank account if it’s involved in any kind of suspicious transactions, leading Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media raised the alarm this week. Accounts can be blocked if money linked to illegal activities has been credited to them, the portal pointed out, warning that users of crypto exchange services and participants in peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions can easily find themselves in a situation like this. The legislation allows financial institutions to take action in a number of scenarios. These include receiving complaints from third parties, signals alleging illegal actions, including fraud-related flows, and any transfers triggering risk detection systems. Restrictions can be partial or full. In the first case, an affected person is unable to use the payment cards and banking app of a particular institution, and in the latter, the individual loses access to cards issued by all banks and to their platforms. The law’s provisions can be used to target cryptocurrency traders whose bank accounts can be blacklisted by the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ). The most common instances involve the exchange of digital coins for rubles or P2P swaps. No one is safe from receiving “dirty” cash from fraud and money laundering schemes, online gambling, or other illegal activities, when selling their cryptos for fiat through an online exchanger or a P2P platform, the report noted. Moscow can use money laundering legislation to curb crypto usage Russian banks can also freeze accounts under the law “On combating the legalization of proceeds from crime and the financing of terrorism,” also known as the “money laundering law.” It allows banks to flag as “high-risk” and block any sale of cryptocurrency through P2P platforms and digital asset exchanges. Some of its texts were originally intended to deal with a phenomenon known as “dropping.” In Russian slang, a “dropper” is someone who lends their bank account, wallet or card to fraudsters who use them to launder their criminal proceeds. However, critics say the same provisions can be employed against ordinary users of crypto exchanges and P2P trading platforms who could end up with their bank accounts blocked by financial authorities and institutions as well. In May, legal commentators involved in the crypto space warned that recent amendments to the Criminal Code, again aimed at “droppers,” or “money mules,” as they are called in the West, can also be used to threaten crypto traders with account blocking and even prison time. In June, the Bank of Russia urged commercial banks to exert tighter control on crypto-related transfers. The regulator insisted on the swift identification of such transactions. The updated code authorizes banks to impose monthly limits on wires and prevent cash deposits. Russia clears ground for upcoming digital ruble launch The latest Russian offensive against decentralized digital money comes as Moscow prepares for the full implementation of its digital ruble. The CBR recently set the dates for the gradual launch of the central bank digital currency, which should start on September 1, 2026, after Putin’s recent call for “wide adoption.” Along with the state-issued coin, Russia plans to introduce a universal QR code for payments. Its monetary authority has been vehemently opposed to allowing the use of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to pay for goods and services in the country. Crypto payments are only possible within a special “experimental legal regime” designed to help Russian companies circumvent financial restrictions in foreign trade.

This recovery has sparked discussions among market participants about the extent to which large holders and long-dormant wallets influence Bitcoin’s price movements. Contrary to widespread assumptions about whale dominance, recent insight from River , a Bitcoin-focused financial institution, shows that more than 67% of all BTC remains under individual ownership rather than institutional control. 67% of #bitcoin is still owned by individuals.

Bitcoin’s ability to maintain strength above $117,000 during the recent whale selling episode demonstrates such a belief.

Nevertheless, the inherent volatility of cryptocurrency markets demands careful risk management. The Index Bitcoin Cycle Indicators (IBCI) has entered the Distribution zone after five months, a range historically linked to market euphoria and potential peaks. Importantly, the index has only reached the lower boundary of this zone at the 80% level, remaining well below the 100% threshold that previously signaled major cycle tops. Source: CryptoQuant This suggests that Bitcoin’s targets of $140,000-$150,000 remain achievable, as aggressive profit-taking typically seen at cycle peaks has not yet materialized. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Elliott Wave Points to $131K From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s (BTC/USD) daily chart reveals a developing Elliott Wave pattern, with the asset currently positioned in the early phases of Wave (V). The preceding waves (i) through (iv) have been completed according to established wave principles. Source: TradingView Currently, Bitcoin is consolidating just beneath the 9-day EMA at $118,016.64, which serves as immediate resistance. The emergence of a bull pennant or flag formation below this resistance level indicates potential for continued bullish momentum toward the projected Wave (V) target around $131,757. The RSI reading of 66.42 remains below overbought conditions, providing room for additional upward movement. This New Bitcoin Token Could 10X: $5M Raised While Bitcoin moves up and down between key price levels, a new project called Bitcoin Hyper is getting a lot of attention. This project is still in its early funding stage and has already raised over $5 million, showing that many investors believe in it. So what is Bitcoin Hyper? Think of it as an upgrade to regular Bitcoin. It’s built on what’s called a “Layer 2” system, basically a newer technology that sits on top of Bitcoin to make it work better. This is the first project of its kind, which is why so many people are interested in buying in early. Several crypto experts think the $HYPER token could go up 10 times in value from the current price. Right now, early investors can buy $HYPER tokens for $0.0124 each. The price will increase as the project progresses through various funding stages, so purchasing early may result in a better deal.

2025-07-26 14:30:25+00:00,"Bank Insider Drains $195,000 From Churches, Kids Museum and Customers, Fakes Own Death To Prevent Recovery of Incriminating Evidence: US Department of Justice","A bank employee is pleading guilty to stealing from the lender’s customers and lying to conceal her guilt, according to the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Eastern District says Truist Bank employee, Ahshah Dior Martin, stole $195,000 from at least 70 Truist Bank accounts. Martin started gathering banking information on her would-be victims in 2023 after improperly accessing the bank’s computer systems. “Then, she initiated fraudulent debits and withdrawals from these accounts for her own benefit. For instance, Martin repeatedly initiated payments from customer bank accounts to a child support payment processor, through which Martin paid herself.” The victims Martha stole from while working at Truist Bank were diverse and comprised of both individuals and entities, according to the Eastern District. They included “multiple churches, a children’s museum, an eye tissue bank non-profit organization, manufacturing and construction companies, a small business making customized holsters, and the North Carolina Wing of the Civil Air Patrol.” Truist Bank fired Martin in April of 2024 but she frustrated efforts by the eighth-largest US bank by total assets to retrieve the computer she had been issued at work. “To conceal her wrongdoing and prevent the return of her Truist laptop, Martin faked her own death. On April 17, 2024, in response to an email from Truist asking for the computer, Martin responded, “Sorry to inform you, she has passed away.”” The former Truist Bank employee spent the money she stole on “cosmetic products, clothing, travel expenses, dining, and at a hookah bar,” the Eastern District says. Martin faces up to three decades in prison. She will be sentenced in November.

El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy is facing new challenges, says Quentin Ehrenmann of NGO My First Bitcoin.

He affirms that Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, will play a significant role in the financial world in the future. Brandt believes that Bitcoin will serve as an economic foundation over the coming decades, providing a secure alternative to traditional money. Peter Brandt Warns Bitcoin Might Let Down Gen Z Traders However, Brandt, in a post on X , warns Gen Z traders who see crypto as a quick way to get rich. He advises young investors not to treat Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as a simple solution for financial problems. Brandt explains that emotional trading, a lack of discipline, and the pursuit of quick gains can lead to economic troubles in the unpredictable cryptocurrency market. While emphasizing the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading, Brandt also shared a list of essential books for anyone serious about understanding Bitcoin and crypto trading. These books provide valuable insights into market psychology, risk management, technical analysis, and the basic principles of blockchain technology. It is worth noting that this is not the first time the veteran trader has warned young investors in the cryptocurrency space. Last year, Brandt warned young investors that Bitcoin’s future growth trajectory might not make them rich . He implied that as Bitcoin matures, its growth potential may slow down. Some factors that trigger this include market saturation, increased adoption, or the law of diminishing returns. Is Bitcoin Still a “Road to Financial Glory?” Despite this note of warning, Brandt maintains that Bitcoin is still a “great hedge vs. fiat busts. That is, he still believes Bitcoin can serve as a way to preserve wealth , particularly during economic instability. Brandt’s post suggests that Bitcoin currently serves as a more effective store of value than a tool for rapid wealth accumulation. He, therefore, warned Gen Z not to see Bitcoin as a “road to financial glory” or else they might suffer disappointment. In all, Bitcoin remains the leading digital currency in the market. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at approximately $118,180, representing a 2% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data . “Invest-and-Forget” Approach for Bitcoin Meanwhile, earlier in the year, Fred Thiel, CEO of MARA Holdings, suggested a straightforward strategy for retail investors: invest in BTC regularly and let it be . In his words, “My recommendation to my kids, for example, is to put a little aside every month in BTC and let it grow over time.” He emphasized that, over a period of two to four years, this method can yield significant returns, noting Bitcoin’s average annual growth of 29% to over 50%. Thiel acknowledges the volatility inherent in Bitcoin compared to traditional financial assets. He remained confident in the cryptocurrency’s potential to outperform over extended periods. Intriguingly, MARA Holdings mirrors its CEO’s bullish stance on Bitcoin .

He, therefore, warned Gen Z not to see Bitcoin as a “road to financial glory” or else they might suffer disappointment. In all, Bitcoin remains the leading digital currency in the market.

In his words, “My recommendation to my kids, for example, is to put a little aside every month in BTC and let it grow over time.” He emphasized that, over a period of two to four years, this method can yield significant returns, noting Bitcoin’s average annual growth of 29% to over 50%. Thiel acknowledges the volatility inherent in Bitcoin compared to traditional financial assets. He remained confident in the cryptocurrency’s potential to outperform over extended periods.

2025-07-26 16:26:19+00:00,BlackRock goes against Wall Street consensus in calls for Fed interest rate cuts,"BlackRock is calling for rate cuts. While most of Wall Street wants the Federal Reserve to keep rates steady or deliver minimal easing, BlackRock’s Rick Rieder says the central bank needs to start cutting now. Rieder, who serves as Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income at BlackRock, made the case in a Bloomberg TV interview, arguing that interest rates are damaging low-income Americans and stalling broader economic potential. “The service economy is what drives this economy today,” Rieder said. “It’s not a goods-oriented economy, not commodities, not exports, not manufacturing.” According to the Bloomberg interview, he believes that since most of the economy is now service-based, it has become resistant to rate-driven slowdowns in goods. That, he says, makes the old way of targeting inflation through aggressive hikes less effective, and more harmful in the wrong places. Rieder explained that today’s interest rates are hitting one part of the economy especially hard: housing . “The real impact of interest rates on the economy today… it’s about housing,” he said. And that impact, he explained, is falling on the shoulders of low-income borrowers. “People that borrow today are lower-income and they’re adversely impacted, infected, by where these rates are.” He argued that lowering rates would allow for more housing construction and better affordability. “If we get the rate down, you actually can bring home prices down. You build more houses, you’ll actually reduce inflation,” Rieder said. Despite the economy performing well on the surface, he sees rate cuts as consistent with managing the inflation outlook. He pointed out that inflation break-evens are currently between 2.5% and 2.75%, while the Fed funds rate could be cut to 3.25% and still stay above that level. “I think we got plenty of room to drop it,” he said. BlackRock bets on AI, crypto, and stablecoins while waiting for Fed to act Rieder said the only long-term path out of the U.S. debt problem is to grow faster than the debt itself. “There’s only one way to de-lever the economy. You’ve got to outrun the debt. You got to outgrow it,” he said. He said a combination of GDP growth between 4.5% to 5% and a drop in interest rates to 3% could help, though it would take time. On the tech side, Rieder leaned heavily into artificial intelligence as a future growth engine. “People underestimate how dramatic this is gonna be,” he said. He tied AI, robotics, cloud, software, energy, and cooling into one broad theme of accelerated productivity. “Our world a year or two hence is gonna see things that nobody’s ever seen before,” he said . AI-driven automation will create lower-cost services, improve business efficiency, and change how companies operate entirely. “It doesn’t have to be necessarily the Mag 7,” Rieder added. He believes companies that use data effectively, whether they’re retailers, media platforms, or tech firms, are best positioned. “The companies that utilize data to expand their mode… how they advertise, how they run their business efficiently using software,” are the real winners. Rieder still favors large-cap growth stocks and tech. “I still believe in growth, in technology and equities,” he said. He also supports balancing portfolios with small amounts of gold or crypto. On crypto, Rieder made it clear he owns some personally. He didn’t go into detail on amounts, but said it’s held in “moderate size.” More importantly, he called stablecoins a key part of the future financial system. “Stablecoin, I actually think will be quite helpful,” he said. “It will soak up some of the Treasuries… not a tremendous amount, but some.” He also said stablecoins will help with global dollar use and with tokenized payments and investments. Rieder ended by calling the global crypto adoption rate “extraordinary.” Despite volatility, he sees it as a growing part of the economy that investors will have to deal with, like it or not.

2025-07-26 16:30:04+00:00,Nigeria Confirms Readiness For Stablecoin Operations – Details,"The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the nation’s willingness to embrace stablecoin businesses within its borders. This event marks a crucial development in Nigeria’s crypto regulation after the West African giant began to change its hostile approach against the virtual asset industry in 2023. We Will Deal With Stablecoins But On Our Terms: SEC DG According to local media Punch Newspapers , Emomotimi Agama, the Nigerian SEC Director-General (DG), expressed the commission’s readiness to condole and foster stablecoin operations. This announcement came during the DG’s keynote address at the Nigerian Stablecoin Summit in Lagos on Thursday, organized by the African Stablecoin Network. According to Agama, the SEC welcomes all stablecoin businesses that are ready to operate on conditions that protect and empower Nigerian markets. The DG strongly emphasized this message in highlighting the need to balance responsible innovation with regulation. In showing the Commission’s readiness to deal with stablecoin operators, Agama also referenced the recent Investment and Securities Act 2025, which offers provisions in governing the digital assets industry, representing the first legal step in creating a suitable business environment for stablecoins. However, while acknowledging the global trend in actively embracing stablecoins, the SEC boss hinted at potential differences in regulations while explaining the need to implement solutions unique to the Nigerian landscape.

The Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced the nation’s willingness to embrace stablecoin businesses within its borders. This event marks a crucial development in Nigeria’s crypto regulation after the West African giant began to change its hostile approach against the virtual asset industry in 2023. We Will Deal With Stablecoins But On Our Terms: SEC DG According to local media Punch Newspapers , Emomotimi Agama, the Nigerian SEC Director-General (DG), expressed the commission’s readiness to condole and foster stablecoin operations. This announcement came during the DG’s keynote address at the Nigerian Stablecoin Summit in Lagos on Thursday, organized by the African Stablecoin Network. According to Agama, the SEC welcomes all stablecoin businesses that are ready to operate on conditions that protect and empower Nigerian markets. The DG strongly emphasized this message in highlighting the need to balance responsible innovation with regulation. In showing the Commission’s readiness to deal with stablecoin operators, Agama also referenced the recent Investment and Securities Act 2025, which offers provisions in governing the digital assets industry, representing the first legal step in creating a suitable business environment for stablecoins. However, while acknowledging the global trend in actively embracing stablecoins, the SEC boss hinted at potential differences in regulations while explaining the need to implement solutions unique to the Nigerian landscape.

The price briefly dipped near the $115,000 support level but has already begun to recover, signaling that bullish momentum remains intact despite recent selling pressure. Market participants appear to be reacting calmly, with strong demand quickly absorbing the dip. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pullback Remains Within Normal Volatility Range: Drawdown Analysis Shows No Signs Of Panic According to fresh data from CryptoQuant, today’s price movement coincides with a significant increase in open interest across major exchanges. Binance, Bybit, and Gate all recorded sharp spikes in open interest within the last 24 hours, suggesting that traders are positioning aggressively. Notably, these exchanges were among the recipients of large Bitcoin transfers earlier in the day, likely tied to institutional or whale activity. This alignment of price recovery and rising open interest hints at a shift in sentiment. Short-term traders are re-entering the market, while bulls appear ready to defend key levels. As volatility picks up, Bitcoin’s ability to hold and reclaim recent support will determine whether it resumes its upward march or remains range-bound. The coming days could be critical for setting the tone of the next leg in Bitcoin’s price action. Rising Open Interest Signals Growing Volatility According to Julio Moreno, CryptoQuant’s head of research, over the last 24 hours, open interest surged by approximately $4 billion, indicating that leveraged positions—particularly shorts—have entered the market in large numbers. This spike coincided with significant Bitcoin transfers to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit, which received a substantial portion of today’s large-volume transactions. These developments suggest increased speculative activity as traders anticipate further price movement. The inflow of coins to exchanges, combined with rising open interest, typically signals upcoming volatility. Short sellers appear to be betting on continued downside, but with Bitcoin already recovering from its recent $115,000 dip, this could lead to a short squeeze if momentum shifts back in favor of the bulls. This market shift comes as Ethereum and altcoins show notable strength. Since May, Ethereum has consistently outperformed Bitcoin, aided by institutional accumulation and clearer regulatory signals in the US. As ETH leads the altcoin rally, investors are watching closely to see whether capital rotation from BTC into altcoins continues.

2025-07-26 16:43:01+00:00,Bitcoin Price Analysis: Is a Crash to $111K Imminent for BTC?,"Bitcoin’s muted volatility phase continues, with structural support holding firm. The market’s next decisive move will likely be shaped by reactions at the $114,000 and $111,000 support zones. BTC Price Analysis: Technicals By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin continues to consolidate within the narrow $116K–$120K range, marked by low volatility and subdued price action. This sideways movement suggests an ongoing equilibrium between buying and selling pressure, possibly due to capital rotation into the altcoin markets. A key concern is the emergence of a bearish divergence between the price and the RSI indicator, indicating a fading of bullish momentum. This divergence increases the likelihood of renewed selling pressure and suggests a possible continuation of the correction phase. If so, a move toward the $111,000 support level becomes probable. Despite this, the broader market structure remains bullish as long as the $111,000 level holds. If this price point acts as a reliable demand zone, an eventual breakout above $120K could resume the larger uptrend. Source: TradingView The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, BTC is forming a bullish flag pattern, a classic consolidation formation within an uptrend. The price has consistently printed higher highs and higher lows, supported by an ascending trendline acting as dynamic support, currently near the $114K level. As long as this trendline remains intact, the market is likely to continue consolidating inside the flag, which aligns with a healthy correction. However, a breakdown below this ascending support would likely trigger a sharper pullback toward $111K, forming a key liquidity zone. Source: TradingView On-chain Analysis By Shayan The latest futures order flow shows a noticeable surge in small-sized positions, a strong indication that retail traders are actively participating in the current price range. This spike reveals a high level of retail engagement, especially within the $116K–$120K consolidation zone. Interestingly, large-scale sell-side activity (represented by green circles), typically associated with institutions or whales, is not present. These major players are not offloading their positions, suggesting that they remain confident in the ongoing bullish trend and do not expect a major reversal just yet. This setup, with retail activity high and smart money quiet, has historically preceded major bullish moves. While the market may seem stagnant, this phase often serves as a cooling-off period before another leg of the upward trend. The lack of panic from whales adds weight to the theory that this is a healthy consolidation, not a trend reversal. Once the current range resolves, a fresh wave of demand may enter the market, likely pushing Bitcoin toward new highs.

According to a post on the social media platform X, India’s Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) says it seized 28 kilograms of gold paste – worth roughly $3.34 million at current prices – after they got off their plane from Dubai. The CISF said the gold paste was “ingeniously” concealed on their bodies, and that the seizure sets a new benchmark for pro-active surveillance and profiling. Gold smugglers will often turn their gold into a paste containing non-metallic substances like resin or glue in order to avoid setting off metal detectors which would otherwise easily spot regular coins or bars. The male suspect was reportedly wearing pants, while the female was wearing a salwar suit, a traditional Indian dress. However, security noticed “bulges” around their midsections, drawing suspicion. Speaking to local NDTV , a senior CISF officer said, “The duo, residents of Gujarat, caught the officer’s attention due to their unusual walking pattern and slight bulges around their abdominal area, which did not match the natural body contour… A total of 28 kg of gold paste was found neatly strapped around their midsections and upper torsos – 16 kg on the woman and 12 kg on the man.” Another official investigating the case said the seizure was “likely the biggest gold haul in the history of Surat airport.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Long-term forecasts indicate potential highs of $5.65 by 2030. Algorand’s strong push for scalability, security, and decentralization is paying off. With the launch of AlgoKit 3.0 in Q1 2025 and growing developer interest, ALGO adoption has improved and is now on the rise. The rising adoption is beneficial for an asset, as it is directly proportional to a token’s price. But the big question for intrigued market participants still remains: Can ALGO Price hit $1 this cycle?

With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In Q4 2024, Algorand (ALGO) experienced a significant drive, reaching a high of $0.613, marking a remarkable 470% gain from the $0.1079 level. However, the excitement was short-lived as a sell-off intensified in the final month of 2024, extending that into Q1 2025. By the first week of April, ALGO’s price plummeted to a low of $0.1491, which established a strong multi-year support area. From the second week of April, the price action began to shift, forming a higher-high structure that indicated a recovery from the multi-year support level. By mid-May, Algorand’s price had climbed nearly 70% to $0.24 from the Q2 low of $0.150. Unfortunately, this upward momentum was halted in mid-May as strong supply levels rejected further advances, pushing the price below the 200-day EMA band. In the third week of June, ALGO returned to April’s low, finding support at the $0.15 level. At this point, the price was down 71% from Q4 2024’s high and 32% from mid-May’s peak. The risks were high, with indications that any short-term bearish pressure could lead to a drop to the 2024 low of $0.0943, breaching the $0.15 support. However, everything changed last week in June, which was also the finishing week for H1. The momentum in H2 began with the blast. Algo Price Target July 2025 For Algorand, the demand surged in the last week of June with bulls reviving at the price of $0.15, driven by high demand, breaking through the multi-month resistance trendline. By mid-July, ALGO had surpassed mid-May’s high after breaking the 200-day EMA band. Also, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands formed a golden cross, signaling continued bullish demand in the short term. From late June to July 18th, ALGO price surged to $0.34, recording a remarkable 110% gain, largely fueled by the overall bullish stance in the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $123,231. But, BTC went into consolidation, and the altcoin sector faced profit booking that resulted in AVAX pullback to $0.26, which aligns with multi-month resistance that turned into crucial support now. As July is about to conclude, if the $0.26-$0.27 level maintains strong demand, ALGO may aim for a retest of the $0.34 mark by the end of the month, and if it flips $0.34, then in August $ a 0.50 retest could be imminent. But losing the grip at $0.26-$0.27 could drop ALGO to $0.21. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast July 2025 0.18 0.30 0.34 ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Looking ahead to the remaining second half of 2025, if demand increases in direct proportion to adoption at an unprecedented rate, ALGO could clear significant targets such as the $0.60, $0.80 mark, and potentially reach $0.90 by year-end. While these targets may seem ambitious compared to its current price on the daily chart, a broader view of the monthly chart data reveals that the last three years have been characterized by a range-bound sideways mov",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-prediction/algorand-algo-price-prediction/,ALGO|TRADING|ALTCOIN|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BTC,Cryptocurrency Price Prediction|Price Prediction,BTC,"Algorand Price Prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030: Will ALGO Price Hit $1?.

Table of Contents Story Highlights Overview CoinPedia’s Algorand Price Prediction Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) Algo Price Target July 2025 ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Algorand Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast 2026 ALGO Coin Price Projection 2027 Algorand Crypto Price Action 2028 ALGO Token Price Analysis 2029 ALGO Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Algorand Token ALGO Price $ 0.27500945 6.10% Market cap $ 2,388,826,433.9528 Circulating Supply 8,686,343,172.4368 Trading Volume $ 94,842,493.0912 All-time high $3.28 Jun 21, 2019 All-time low $0.0958 Jun 10, 2023 CoinPedia’s Algorand Price Prediction As per Coinpedia’s Algorand Price Prediction, the forecast for the Algorand network is optimistic for the coming years. With a potential altcoin market in Q1 2025, the ALGO coin price might skyrocket toward a new high. If the network maintains the staggering growth, the ALGO coin price may reach $0.89 in 2025. Conversely, if the network fails to expand, then the price can flip into a bearish trap and dip to $0.45. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.45 $0.67 $0.89 Algorand Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In Q4 2024, Algorand (ALGO) experienced a significant drive, reaching a high of $0.613, marking a remarkable 470% gain from the $0.1079 level. However, the excitement was short-lived as a sell-off intensified in the final month of 2024, extending that into Q1 2025. By the first week of April, ALGO’s price plummeted to a low of $0.1491, which established a strong multi-year support area. From the second week of April, the price action began to shift, forming a higher-high structure that indicated a recovery from the multi-year support level. By mid-May, Algorand’s price had climbed nearly 70% to $0.24 from the Q2 low of $0.150. Unfortunately, this upward momentum was halted in mid-May as strong supply levels rejected further advances, pushing the price below the 200-day EMA band. In the third week of June, ALGO returned to April’s low, finding support at the $0.15 level. At this point, the price was down 71% from Q4 2024’s high and 32% from mid-May’s peak. The risks were high, with indications that any short-term bearish pressure could lead to a drop to the 2024 low of $0.0943, breaching the $0.15 support. However, everything changed last week in June, which was also the finishing week for H1. The momentum in H2 began with the blast. Algo Price Target July 2025 For Algorand, the demand surged in the last week of June with bulls reviving at the price of $0.15, driven by high demand, breaking through the multi-month resistance trendline. By mid-July, ALGO had surpassed mid-May’s high after breaking the 200-day EMA band. Also, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands formed a golden cross, signaling continued bullish demand in the short term. From late June to July 18th, ALGO price surged to $0.34, recording a remarkable 110% gain, largely fueled by the overall bullish stance in the crypto market, particularly with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $123,231. But, BTC went into consolidation, and the altcoin sector faced profit booking that resulted in AVAX pullback to $0.26, which aligns with multi-month resistance that turned into crucial support now. As July is about to conclude, if the $0.26-$0.27 level maintains strong demand, ALGO may aim for a retest of the $0.34 mark by the end of the month, and if it flips $0.34, then in August $ a 0.50 retest could be imminent. But losing the grip at $0.26-$0.27 could drop ALGO to $0.21. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Algorand (ALGO) Price Forecast July 2025 0.18 0.30 0.34 ALGO Price Analysis 2025 (H2) Looking ahead to the remaining second half of 2025, if demand increases in direct proportion to adoption at an unprecedented rate, ALGO could clear significant targets such as the $0.60, $0.80 mark, and potentially reach $0.90 by year-end. While these targets may seem ambitious compared to its current price on the daily chart, a broader view of the monthly chart data reveals that the last three years have been characterized by a range-bound sideways mov"

The forces that shaped these cycles have weakened in the new environment. The expert drew attention to the following changes: Halvings, which led to ”demand shocks,” have been replaced by steady, incremental purchases of cryptocurrency by institutions and corporations. The risk of collapse has been reduced by improved regulation and the institutionalization of the industry. The new trend for the next 5–10 years is the influx of funds into BTC ETFs. Traditional financial institutions are only just beginning to participate. Legislative support, such as the recent passage of the GENIUS Act, is helping bring Wall Street players who will invest “billions in the coming years” in cryptocurrency, Hougan said. He added that, in the context of macroeconomics, the correlation with changes in Fed interest rates has become positive, not negative as it was in 2018 and 2022. “All of this suggests that long-term cryptocurrency forces will overwhelm the classic ‘quadruple cycle’ factors, if there is such a thing. 2026 will be a good year. I could be wrong, but we’ll see significant volatility. And I think it’s more of a ‘stable, stable boom’ than a supercycle,” Hougan said.

2025-07-26 17:48:06+00:00,"Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan Says Four-Year Cycle Is Dead, Predicts 2026 Will Be a Good Year for Bitcoin and Crypto – Here’s Why","The chief investment officer (CIO) of crypto asset management firm Bitwise, Matt Hougan, is saying the four-year cycle, which has traditionally influenced the boom and bust cycles of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the rest of the crypto market, is “dead.” Hougan says the “forces that have created prior four-year cycles are weaker” currently and this includes the Bitcoin halving. According to Hougan, the impact and importance of the Bitcoin halving falls by half every four years. Additionally, Hougan says there exists a friendlier regulatory environment and institutional investors have embraced Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Per Hougan, these “bigger forces” don’t synchronize with the four-year cycle. “i) The movement of assets into [exchange-traded funds] ETFs is a 5 – 10 year trend. It started in 2024; ii) Broader institutional adoption is just getting started (ETFs still being approved on national account platforms, pensions and endowments just now considering crypto, etc.) iii) Regulatory progress began in earnest in January 2025 and will run for multiple years; iv) Wall Street is just now starting to build on crypto, and will invest billions in the quarters and years to come. This started in earnest with the passage of the GENIUS Act this month.” As a result, the Bitwise CIO says these emerging forces will be more influential in determining the future of Bitcoin and other crypto assets than the four-year cycle going forward. “All this suggests to me that the long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic “four-year cycle” forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The chief investment officer (CIO) of crypto asset management firm Bitwise, Matt Hougan, is saying the four-year cycle, which has traditionally influenced the boom and bust cycles of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the rest of the crypto market, is “dead.” Hougan says the “forces that have created prior four-year cycles are weaker” currently and this includes the Bitcoin halving. According to Hougan, the impact and importance of the Bitcoin halving falls by half every four years. Additionally, Hougan says there exists a friendlier regulatory environment and institutional investors have embraced Bitcoin and other crypto assets. Per Hougan, these “bigger forces” don’t synchronize with the four-year cycle. “i) The movement of assets into [exchange-traded funds] ETFs is a 5 – 10 year trend. It started in 2024; ii) Broader institutional adoption is just getting started (ETFs still being approved on national account platforms, pensions and endowments just now considering crypto, etc.) iii) Regulatory progress began in earnest in January 2025 and will run for multiple years; iv) Wall Street is just now starting to build on crypto, and will invest billions in the quarters and years to come. This started in earnest with the passage of the GENIUS Act this month.” As a result, the Bitwise CIO says these emerging forces will be more influential in determining the future of Bitcoin and other crypto assets than the four-year cycle going forward. “All this suggests to me that the long-term pro-crypto forces will overwhelm the classic “four-year cycle” forces, to the extent those exist, and that 2026 will be a good year.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As LINKBTC gains momentum and Bitcoin’s dominance trend declines, the setup appears promising. Cryptowzrd noted he will be monitoring the intraday chart closely for the next scalp opportunity, particularly if LINK breaks above the intraday lower high trendline. Bitcoin Dominance Weakens: A Catalyst For Chainlink’s Surge According to Cryptowzrd, both LINK’s daily candle and the LINKBTC pair ended the day on a bullish note. This positive price action is drawing attention to the potential for further upside movement. Cryptowzrd emphasized that continued strength in LINKBTC, especially if fueled by ongoing weakness in Bitcoin Dominance, could help LINK gain significant bullish momentum from its current levels. Related Reading: Chainlink Sees Heavy Accumulation – Whales Add 8M LINK In One Month Looking ahead, the next major resistance target for LINK is set at $20. Cryptowzrd suggested that a firm hold above this level could act as a catalyst for a stronger rally toward higher resistance levels, possibly reaching $30 and beyond. The speed at which this move might unfold was another key point highlighted by Cryptowzrd. He expects that once LINK clears the $20 hurdle, the rally could accelerate rapidly, driven by increased bullish pressure and technical confirmation across multiple timeframes. While the outlook is bullish, Cryptowzrd also pointed out an important support zone to watch. The $16 level has been identified as the main daily support target. Holding above this area will be crucial to maintaining the current bullish structure and preventing any deeper pullbacks. Overall, Cryptowzrd’s analysis suggests that Chainlink is positioned for a potential breakout phase, with $20 acting as the immediate resistance to watch. If Bitcoin Dominance continues to weaken and LINKBTC remains strong, traders could see a swift and powerful rally unfold in the days ahead. Volatility Vs. Patience: Navigating LINK’s Weekend Setup Concluding his analysis, Cryptowzrd noted that LINK’s intraday chart experienced significant volatility in the last 24 hours, reflecting an uncertain short-term outlook. He expects this choppy price action to continue, but due to the lower trading activity typically seen over the weekend, his expectations remain rational. Related Reading: Chainlink Bullish Trigger: Why $16 Holds The Key To The Next Rally The key level to watch is $18.40, which serves as an intraday resistance target.

Things Are Heating Up – Here Are the Details,"US banking giant JPMorgan has reportedly suspended its customer onboarding process with cryptocurrency exchange Gemini. This decision comes on the heels of a social media post by Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, in which he accused the bank of “trying to kill fintech and crypto companies.” In another post today, Winklevoss alleged that JPMorgan canceled Gemini''s re-acceptance process because of a previous tweet by Winklevoss. In that tweet, Winklevoss warned that major banks were trying to bypass the Open Banking Rule, drafted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which takes effect at the end of 2024. This new regulation gives consumers the right to freely share their bank data with third-party platforms. Platforms like Plaid serve as a key bridge for transferring funds to cryptocurrency exchanges like Gemini, Coinbase, and Kraken.

2025-07-26 18:16:00+00:00,Ethereum ETFs Log $452M Fresh Inflows In 16-Day Winning Streak,"Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are having a great month. On July 25, the digital funds recorded another strong performance, pulling in over $452 million in new investments. This marks the 16th consecutive trading day that investors have added funds to these accounts. This indicates a steady and growing interest in Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. BlackRock’s Fund Takes the Lead BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) led the way again , collecting $440.10 million in net inflows on Friday alone. The fund now manages $10.69 billion in assets, making it the most prominent spot Ethereum ETF in the United States. Other funds also saw positive movement, though on a smaller scale. Bitwise’s ETHW brought in $9.95 million, while Fidelity’s FETH added $7.30 million. However, Grayscale’s ETHE continued to struggle. It saw $23.49 million in withdrawals, raising its total outflow to $4.29 billion. This is the most significant loss among all Ethereum ETFs to date. Since launch, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have seen a total of $9.33 billion in net inflows, bringing their combined assets to $20.66 billion. This accounts for approximately 4.64% of Ethereum’s total market value. On July 24 alone, trading volume reached $1.5 billion. The most significant single-day inflow during this 16-day streak came on July 16, when investors added $726.74 million. Many other days in July have also seen inflows over $300 million . Why Investors Are Turning to ETH ETFs The steady inflow is driven by both retail and institutional investors , who are confident in Ethereum’s long-term value. They believe Ethereum’s role in areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi), staking, and smart contracts lends it value beyond being just a cryptocurrency. According to Bitwise’s Matt Hougan, rising interest in stablecoins and tokenized assets is another reason demand for ETH ETFs is likely to stay strong. Hougan estimated that ETH exchange-traded products (ETPs) and related companies might buy as much as $20 billion worth of Ethereum in 2026. That would be around 5.33 million ETH at current prices. However, Ethereum’s network is expected to produce only about 0.8 million ETH in the same period. If Hougan’s prediction is right, demand could outpace supply by nearly seven times. Bitcoin ETFs Also Rebound While Ethereum is seeing a steady rise , Bitcoin ETFs also made a comeback on Friday. The investment funds attracted $130.69 million in new investments after a few days of outflows. Earlier in the week, Bitcoin ETFs saw $131.35 million pulled out on July 21, followed by smaller outflows on July 22 and 23. Despite this dip, Bitcoin ETFs still hold a strong position. Its total inflow now stands at $54.82 billion, with total net assets reaching $151.45 billion.

2025-07-26 18:45:31+00:00,"Vanguard President Defies Consensus Expectations, Says US Equities Primed To Underperform Over the Long-Term: Report","The president and chief investment officer of the financial giant Vanguard isn’t particularly bullish on US stocks over the next decade. Gregory Davis tells Fortune in a new interview that US equities aren’t primed to continue raking in double-digit gains year after year. “Our investment strategy group’s projection is that US equity market returns are going to be much more muted in the future. Over the past ten years, the S&P returned an average of 12.4% annually. We’re predicting the figure to drop to between 3.8% and 5.8% (midpoint of 4.8%) over the next decade.” The Vanguard president also argues that corporate profits have been abnormally high and aren’t likely to continue at that pace. Davis says the classic portfolio makeup of 60% stocks and 40% bonds has fallen out of whack for investors who haven’t rebalanced their holdings amid the longstanding equities bull market. “In the past 10 years, interest rates have mainly been very low, so bonds returned only around 2% a year, or 10% less than stocks. So the stock portion kept compounding at a high rate and getting bigger, and the bond portion kept shrinking as a share of the total. As a result, what started as a 60-40 mix is now 80-20 in favor of stocks.” He also notes that US stocks have beaten international equities by 6% a year over the past decade, further unbalancing investor portfolios. “So 10 years ago, if you started with the standard split 70% U.S. and 30% foreign, you’d now be at 80% U.S. and 20% foreign.” Davis suggests investors should put 60% of their portfolios in bonds, 20% in foreign stocks and only 20% in US stocks over the next 10 years. “If you look at the bond market today and the way yields have risen, we’re projecting that you’re going to pick up very similar returns in a mix of US and foreign bonds as you’ll get in US equities, or also 4% to 5%. So the expectations are comparable, but you’ll have much less volatility on the bond side… What’s the big advantage to betting on risky stocks when you can get 4.3% on three-month Treasuries?” The Vanguard president also doesn’t suggest investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ), which he considers “speculation.” “It’s not investing in a cash flow generating business, it’s not investing in bonds where you have a commitment to getting a coupon payment every six months, then principal at maturity. I t’s basically looking to sell to someone willing to pay more than you did. And the whole idea that a limited supply of Bitcoin will drive up its value is questionable when you consider that there’s an unlimited supply of new types of crypto that could be created.

2025-07-26 18:48:30+00:00,"Galaxy Quietly Executes a $9.6 Billion Bitcoin Sale, And the Market Barely Blinked","In what might go down as one of the largest BTC sales in crypto history, Galaxy Digital just helped move over 80,000 Bitcoin, worth more than $9.6 billion,on behalf of a Satoshi-era whale. No slippage. No liquidations. No panic. Just a flawless off-exchange execution that showcased the new face of crypto market maturity. A Whale From the Early Days These weren’t just any coins. They belonged to one of Bitcoin’s earliest miners, someone who accumulated BTC back in 2009–2010, when most of the world hadn’t even heard the word “blockchain.” For years, these wallets sat dormant. Then, in the past week, they finally moved. The reason? Estate planning. Sources say the seller is an original HODLer managing generational wealth. And Galaxy stepped in as the architect of that transition. A whale sold 80,000 $BTC via Galaxy Digital The early Bitcoin investor cashed out around $9 billion, marking one of the largest sales in crypto history. Interestingly, this sale had little impact on BTC price, which quickly rebounded back from the $115,000 level. pic.twitter.com/YHS3cEu3wR — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 26, 2025 The entire transaction was handled via Galaxy Digital’s OTC desk,no open market exposure, no order book dumping. A clean block trade. Efficient. Silent. Professional. BTC Price Snapshot (via CoinMarketCap) Current Price: $117,500 (+2.1% 24h) Market Cap: $2.31 trillion 24h Volume: $35 billion Circulating Supply: 19.66 million BTC FDV: $2.46 trillion What’s stunning isn’t just the size,it’s the lack of impact. At most, BTC dipped to $115,000 before snapping back to $117,000 within hours. There was no flash crash, no cascading liquidations, just a smooth rebound. The market absorbed $9.6 billion without blinking, and that’s not luck; that’s structural strength. Why This Galaxy Sale Matters This wasn’t just a massive transaction. It was a litmus test. A sale of this scale, in earlier years, would’ve cratered the market. Even rumors of old wallets moving coins used to send Twitter (now X) into meltdown. But this time? Galaxy facilitated a historic exit,and no one got wrecked. It speaks volumes about how far crypto infrastructure has come. The ecosystem now boasts deep OTC liquidity, compliant execution desks, institutional-grade custody, and smart players managing exits with precision and discretion. A Shift in the On-Chain Lifecycle More than just a sale, this move signals a generational shift. The earliest Bitcoiners are no longer just HODLing. They’re creating estate plans, diversifying portfolios, and passing assets down. Crypto wealth is aging. But it’s also maturing, getting the same treatment as legacy assets. Galaxy is becoming a trusted bridge for that transition. Their role is evolving beyond exchange. They’re stepping into private wealth management, family office consulting, legacy planning,and doing it in stealth mode. Key Takeaways Market passed the stress test: $9.6B moved, price held firm.

In what might go down as one of the largest BTC sales in crypto history, Galaxy Digital just helped move over 80,000 Bitcoin, worth more than $9.6 billion,on behalf of a Satoshi-era whale. No slippage. No liquidations. No panic. Just a flawless off-exchange execution that showcased the new face of crypto market maturity. A Whale From the Early Days These weren’t just any coins. They belonged to one of Bitcoin’s earliest miners, someone who accumulated BTC back in 2009–2010, when most of the world hadn’t even heard the word “blockchain.” For years, these wallets sat dormant. Then, in the past week, they finally moved. The reason? Estate planning. Sources say the seller is an original HODLer managing generational wealth. And Galaxy stepped in as the architect of that transition. A whale sold 80,000 $BTC via Galaxy Digital The early Bitcoin investor cashed out around $9 billion, marking one of the largest sales in crypto history. Interestingly, this sale had little impact on BTC price, which quickly rebounded back from the $115,000 level. pic.twitter.com/YHS3cEu3wR — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 26, 2025 The entire transaction was handled via Galaxy Digital’s OTC desk,no open market exposure, no order book dumping. A clean block trade. Efficient. Silent. Professional. BTC Price Snapshot (via CoinMarketCap) Current Price: $117,500 (+2.1% 24h) Market Cap: $2.31 trillion 24h Volume: $35 billion Circulating Supply: 19.66 million BTC FDV: $2.46 trillion What’s stunning isn’t just the size,it’s the lack of impact. At most, BTC dipped to $115,000 before snapping back to $117,000 within hours. There was no flash crash, no cascading liquidations, just a smooth rebound. The market absorbed $9.6 billion without blinking, and that’s not luck; that’s structural strength. Why This Galaxy Sale Matters This wasn’t just a massive transaction. It was a litmus test. A sale of this scale, in earlier years, would’ve cratered the market. Even rumors of old wallets moving coins used to send Twitter (now X) into meltdown. But this time? Galaxy facilitated a historic exit,and no one got wrecked. It speaks volumes about how far crypto infrastructure has come. The ecosystem now boasts deep OTC liquidity, compliant execution desks, institutional-grade custody, and smart players managing exits with precision and discretion. A Shift in the On-Chain Lifecycle More than just a sale, this move signals a generational shift. The earliest Bitcoiners are no longer just HODLing. They’re creating estate plans, diversifying portfolios, and passing assets down. Crypto wealth is aging. But it’s also maturing, getting the same treatment as legacy assets. Galaxy is becoming a trusted bridge for that transition. Their role is evolving beyond exchange. They’re stepping into private wealth management, family office consulting, legacy planning,and doing it in stealth mode. Key Takeaways Market passed the stress test: $9.6B moved, price held firm. OTC desks are battle-tested: Galaxy’s execution was clean, quiet, and effective. Crypto is no longer just speculation: It’s inheritance. It’s legacy. It’s real wealth. This is likely just the beginning. More early wallets will awaken. More old-school holders will offload or restructure. But if the market can keep absorbing events like this with poise, Bitcoin is truly built to last. And Galaxy? They’re not just facilitating trades anymore. They’re managing eras.

2025-07-26 19:11:02+00:00,Bitcoin Hits $1T Realized Cap as Price Holds Above $118K After $9B BTC Sale by Satoshi-Era Whale,"Bitcoin continues to trade above the $118,000 mark, holding steady after a week of significant institutional developments and a landmark milestone in on-chain metrics. According to CoinDesk Data, BTC was last up 1.45% over the past 24 hours, bringing its 30-day gain to 10.42% and lifting its year-to-date performance to more than 26%. Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode highlighted in its latest ""Week On-chain"" report that July has brought one of the strongest upside breakouts of the year. After dipping to around $105,400 earlier in the month, bitcoin surged to an all-time high of $122,700 before settling into a consolidation phase just below that level. The report noted that this price rally triggered substantial profit-taking from long-term holders while also drawing in new buyers, leading to a sustained inflow of capital into the asset. The result is that bitcoin’s realized capitalization — a measure of the total value of coins based on the last time they were moved — has now surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. Unlike market capitalization, which reflects current price multiplied by total supply, realized cap tracks the actual liquidity deployed into bitcoin over time. This milestone reflects growing conviction among both long-term holders and new entrants, and signals a deepening of the asset’s liquidity base. It also points to bitcoin’s growing role on the macroeconomic stage, with the ability to absorb and settle ever larger volumes of capital. Institutional activity has continued to dominate headlines. On Friday, Mike Novogratz''s Galaxy Digital (GLXY) announced in a press release ""the successful execution of one of the largest notional bitcoin transactions in the history of crypto on behalf of a client."" Galaxy said that it had executed a more than $9 billion bitcoin transaction on behalf of a legacy investor from the early days of the network. The 80,000 BTC sale is one of the largest of its kind in crypto history and was reportedly part of the client’s estate planning. Meanwhile, on Friday, CNBC resurfaced a detail from Tesla’s second quarter of 2022 earnings filings, which disclosed that the company had converted approximately 75% of its bitcoin into fiat currency during that quarter. With bitcoin hovering around $118,000 on Friday morning, David Faber, a ""Squawk on the Street"" co-host, estimated that had Tesla held onto its full bitcoin holdings, the value of its BTC holdings would now exceed $5 billion — four times higher than its reported valuation of $1.25 billion as of the most recent quarter. Technical Analysis Highlights According to CoinDesk Research''s technical analysis data model, during the 23-hour session ending July 26 at 14:00 UTC, the digital asset rallied more than 3%, carving out a $3,300 trading range between $114,937 and $118,237. Support has remained firm in the $117,140–$117,330 zone, while resistance appears to be consolidating just below the $118,200 threshold. The final hour of trading saw modest gains of 0.07% as BTC climbed from $118,095 to $118,183, with tight-range consolidation suggesting continued buying interest just below psychological resistance.

Notably, this price forecast comes following a broader crypto market correction in the past week, during which XRP has registered a 6.74% price decline. XRP Bulls Eye Return To ATH After $3 Retest In an X post on July 25, CasiTrades shows that XRP is on the brink of a major price surge based on the indications of the Elliot Wave Theory – a technical framework that proposes that price movements occur in five repetitive waves. Amidst the price decline in the last week, XRP failed to hold above the critical $3.21 price level, forcing a retrace to retest the major $3.00 support zone, resulting in a slight price bounce. Despite this bearish event, the analyst notes encouragingly that the altcoin did not form a new price low, suggesting the larger bullish structure remains intact. Related Reading: XRP To $10? Basketball Legend’s Poll Puts Crypto On Center Court CasiTrades explains that XRP’s latest retracement reached a deep 0.854 Fibonacci level, a classic reversal zone for second waves in a bullish five-wave structure. This deep pullback, combined with the strong bounce off $3.00, signifies the potential bottom of Wave 2. If bulls can hold the price above this support, this sets the stage for the beginning of Wave 3, the strongest and most explosive leg in the Elliott Wave Theory. For context, the Elliot wave theory begins with an initial price rise, i.e, Wave 1, followed by Wave 2, a pullback that doesn’t breach the starting point. Wave 3 is usually the strongest and longest, driven by increased participation and bullish momentum. Meanwhile, Wave 4 brings another correction, often less severe than Wave 2, before Wave 5 pushes prices to a final high. For Wave 3 to commence in the present market, CasiTrades states the next price target lies at the $3.21 region, which represents a crucial resistance. If XRP produces a sustained breakout above this price barrier, it validates the proposed bullish scenario. In this case, the analyst identifies an immediate price target of $3.82, which aligns with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension of the prior move. Interestingly, this price zone also represents XRP’s all-time high on certain markets. This confluence strengthens confidence in the bullish scenario, especially considering that if the Elliott Wave structure plays out fully, a Wave 5 rally could propel the altcoin into uncharted price territory.
