This sudden dip has sent ripples across the market, prompting investors and enthusiasts alike to closely monitor the situation and ponder its implications. According to Bitcoin World’s diligent market monitoring, BTC is currently trading at $115,889.11 on the Binance USDT market. This immediate shift demands our attention, as understanding such volatility is key to navigating the often unpredictable waters of the crypto space. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop For many, Bitcoin’s journey has been a rollercoaster of exhilarating highs and nerve-wracking lows. This latest Bitcoin price drop is a stark reminder of the market’s inherent volatility. While a drop of a few thousand dollars might seem significant, it’s crucial to put it into perspective within the broader context of Bitcoin’s historical performance. The immediate observation from market data points to a rapid decline from recent levels, pushing BTC below a psychological and technical support level that many traders were closely watching. What does this specific price point of $115,889.11 signify? It indicates a moment of intensified selling pressure or a lack of strong buying interest at higher valuations. For those new to the market, such movements can be alarming, but for seasoned participants, they are often seen as part of Bitcoin’s natural market cycles. It’s a moment for re-evaluation, not necessarily panic. What Factors Contributed to This Bitcoin Price Drop ? When a significant Bitcoin price drop occurs, the natural question is always: why? The cryptocurrency market is influenced by a complex interplay of factors, and pinpointing a single cause is rarely straightforward. However, we can explore several potential drivers that often contribute to such movements: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, such as rising inflation, interest rate hikes by central banks, or geopolitical tensions, can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios. This often means selling off more volatile assets like cryptocurrencies in favor of safer havens. Regulatory Scrutiny: News or rumors of stricter regulations in major economies can create FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) in the market. Uncertainty about future rules can deter new investment and prompt existing holders to sell. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin, often referred to as ‘whales,’ can significantly impact the market with their buying or selling activities. A large sell-off by a whale or a group of whales can trigger a cascade effect, leading to a rapid price decline. Technical Resistance and Support Levels: Traders often use technical analysis to identify key price levels. If Bitcoin fails to break above a strong resistance level or breaks below a significant support level, it can trigger automated sell orders, exacerbating a downward trend. The $116,000 mark might have acted as a crucial support level that, once breached, led to further selling. Market Sentiment and News: General market sentiment, fueled by positive or negative news cycles, can amplify price movements. Negative headlines, even if unrelated to Bitcoin’s fundamentals, can create a pessimistic outlook that encourages selling. How Does This Bitcoin Price Drop Compare to History? Bitcoin’s history is replete with dramatic price swings. From its humble beginnings to its meteoric rises and sharp corrections, volatility is arguably one of its defining characteristics. This current Bitcoin price drop , while notable, is not unprecedented. Consider some past instances: Period Approximate % Drop Context 2013-2015 ~80% Post-bubble burst, Mt. Gox hack. 2017-2018 ~84% After 2017 bull run peak, ‘crypto winter’. March 2020 ~50% COVID-19 market crash (‘Black Thursday’). May 2021 ~50% China’s crypto ban, Elon Musk tweets. Compared to these historical events, a drop from a recent high to $115,889.11, while significant in absolute terms, might represent a smaller percentage correction. This historical perspective is vital because it reminds us that Bitcoin has always recovered from downturns, often reaching new all-time highs. However, past performance is not indicative of future results, and each market cycle has its unique dynamics. Navigating the Market After a Significant Bitcoin Price Drop : What Should Investors Do? A significant Bitcoin price drop can test the resolve of even the most experienced investors.

2025-07-25 03:30:23+00:00,Massive Crypto Liquidation: Unpacking the Shocking 24-Hour Futures Wipeout,"BitcoinWorld Massive Crypto Liquidation: Unpacking the Shocking 24-Hour Futures Wipeout In the dynamic and often tumultuous world of cryptocurrency, sudden market movements are a constant. One of the most impactful, and often feared, events for traders engaging in derivatives is crypto liquidation . Over the past 24 hours, the crypto market witnessed a significant purge, with hundreds of millions of dollars in leveraged positions being wiped out. This isn’t just a number; it represents a cascade of forced selling that can send ripples across the entire digital asset ecosystem. Let’s dive deep into this phenomenon, unpack the latest figures, and understand what these massive liquidations mean for you and the broader market. Understanding Crypto Liquidation: What Exactly Happened? Before we dissect the recent figures, it’s crucial to grasp what crypto liquidation entails. In simple terms, liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position can no longer meet the margin requirements set by an exchange. When the market moves against a highly leveraged position, and the margin balance falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. This forced closure is what we call a liquidation. It’s a protective mechanism, albeit a painful one for the trader involved, designed to manage risk in volatile markets. Perpetual futures contracts are a type of derivative that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. Unlike traditional futures, perpetual contracts do not have an expiry date, making them popular for continuous trading. However, they come with the inherent risk of leverage, meaning traders can open positions much larger than their initial capital. While this amplifies potential profits, it equally magnifies potential losses, making them highly susceptible to rapid market swings and subsequent liquidations. The Recent 24-Hour Crypto Liquidation Breakdown: A Closer Look at the Numbers The past 24 hours saw a significant wave of liquidations across major cryptocurrencies, primarily impacting long positions, which are bets that the price of an asset will increase. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the total value of liquidated positions: Cryptocurrency Total Liquidated (24h) Long Positions Liquidated (%) Ethereum (ETH) $145.86 million 58.63% Bitcoin (BTC) $70.05 million 79.99% XRP (XRP) $48.68 million 76.79% These figures highlight a clear trend: the majority of liquidated positions were ‘longs,’ indicating that a sudden downward price movement caught many bullish traders off guard. Let’s delve into what these numbers tell us about each asset: Ethereum (ETH): $145.86 million in Liquidations ETH led the pack in terms of total value liquidated. With nearly 59% of these being long positions, it suggests that many traders were highly leveraged on ETH, expecting a continued upward trajectory. A sharp correction, possibly triggered by broader market sentiment or specific ETH-related news, would have swiftly pushed these positions into liquidation. The sheer volume underscores Ethereum’s significant role in the derivatives market and its susceptibility to volatility when leveraged. Bitcoin (BTC): $70.05 million in Liquidations As the market’s bellwether, Bitcoin’s liquidations are always closely watched. While lower than ETH’s total, the striking 79.99% long liquidation rate for BTC is a strong indicator. It means a vast majority of those betting on Bitcoin’s rise were caught in the downturn. This level of long liquidation often signifies a market flush-out, clearing out excessive leverage and potentially setting the stage for more sustainable price action, though not without immediate pain. XRP (XRP): $48.68 million in Liquidations XRP’s significant liquidation figure, with almost 77% being long positions, is noteworthy. While not as dominant in market cap as BTC or ETH, XRP often experiences sharp price swings due to news or sentiment, making it a target for leveraged traders. This wave of liquidations suggests that recent bullish sentiment or specific news events might have encouraged an influx of long positions, which were then swiftly unwound by a price drop. Why Do These Massive Crypto Liquidations Occur? Understanding the root causes of these events is key to navigating the crypto landscape. Several factors converge to create the perfect storm for widespread crypto liquidation : Excessive Leverage: This is the primary culprit. Traders use leverage to amplify their potential returns, but it also magnifies losses. A small price movement against a highly leveraged position can quickly deplete a trader’s margin, leading to liquidation. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile assets. Rapid price swings, often triggered by macroeconomic news, regulatory announcements, or large institutional trades, can quickly push prices past liquidation thresholds.

In a stunning turn of events, a sudden and significant shockwave rippled through major exchanges, leading to a staggering $102 million worth of crypto futures liquidation in just the past hour . This immediate fallout is part of a larger trend, with a colossal $667 million in futures liquidated over the last 24 hours . These aren’t just abstract figures; they represent countless trading positions wiped out, capital eroded, and a palpable shift in market sentiment. If you’re involved in crypto, whether as a seasoned trader or a curious observer, understanding the mechanics and implications of such rapid crypto futures liquidation events is absolutely crucial. What does this dramatic episode tell us about the current state of the market, and how can traders better prepare for these sudden shifts? What Exactly is Crypto Futures Liquidation, and Why Does it Happen? To truly grasp the gravity of recent market events, we first need to understand the core concept of crypto futures and, more importantly, what “liquidation” entails. A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a specific cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a future date. Traders often use these to speculate on price movements without owning the underlying asset. The appeal of futures trading in crypto often lies in leverage , which allows traders to control a much larger position with a relatively small amount of capital. For example, with 10x leverage, a $1,000 investment could control a $10,000 position. While this amplifies potential profits, it equally magnifies potential losses. This is where the risk of crypto futures liquidation enters the picture. Liquidation occurs when a trader’s leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange because their margin (the collateral in their account) falls below a required maintenance level. This typically happens when the market moves sharply against their position. For instance, if you’re “long” (betting on price increase) and the price suddenly drops, your position could be liquidated. The exchange sells off your collateral to cover losses, often leading to substantial or total loss of the capital invested in that trade. The primary reasons for such rapid liquidation events include: Sudden Price Volatility: Crypto markets are known for wild price swings. A sharp, unexpected move can quickly push leveraged positions past their liquidation threshold. High Leverage: The higher the leverage used, the smaller the price movement required to trigger a liquidation. Even a small percentage drop can be catastrophic for highly leveraged positions. Cascading Effects: Initial liquidations can add selling pressure, further driving prices, which then triggers more liquidations, creating a domino effect that accelerates the market movement. Why Did This Massive Crypto Futures Liquidation Event Occur So Rapidly? The sheer speed of the recent liquidations— $102 million in just one hour —is particularly striking. While the 24-hour figure of $667 million is substantial, the concentrated burst points to a sudden, powerful catalyst. While specific triggers are often complex (e.g., macroeconomic news, large whale movements, or technical breakdowns), the outcome is clear: a rapid price adjustment caught many leveraged traders off guard. Imagine many traders holding long positions on Bitcoin, expecting its price to rise. If a significant sell-off begins, perhaps due to a large institutional sale or negative news, Bitcoin’s price dips. As it falls, the margin for these leveraged long positions dwindles. Once a critical price point is breached, automated systems on exchanges forcibly close these positions. This forced selling adds further downward pressure, leading to more liquidations at even lower prices, creating a “liquidation cascade.” This rapid succession of events highlights the inherent fragility of markets heavily reliant on high leverage. Crypto exchanges often offer leverage ratios as high as 100x or more, making positions incredibly sensitive to price fluctuations. The suddenness of this particular crypto futures liquidation spree suggests a critical support level was breached, or a significant sell order flooded the market, triggering a chain reaction few could react to in real-time. Who Was Most Affected by This Crypto Futures Liquidation Wave? When such a large-scale crypto futures liquidation event occurs, it’s natural to wonder who bears the brunt. While exact breakdowns are proprietary, we can infer some general patterns. During sharp price downturns, “long” positions (traders betting on price increase) are primarily liquidated. Conversely, during sudden price surges, “short” positions are liquidated.

While the 24-hour figure of $667 million is substantial, the concentrated burst points to a sudden, powerful catalyst. While specific triggers are often complex (e.g., macroeconomic news, large whale movements, or technical breakdowns), the outcome is clear: a rapid price adjustment caught many leveraged traders off guard. Imagine many traders holding long positions on Bitcoin, expecting its price to rise. If a significant sell-off begins, perhaps due to a large institutional sale or negative news, Bitcoin’s price dips. As it falls, the margin for these leveraged long positions dwindles. Once a critical price point is breached, automated systems on exchanges forcibly close these positions. This forced selling adds further downward pressure, leading to more liquidations at even lower prices, creating a “liquidation cascade.” This rapid succession of events highlights the inherent fragility of markets heavily reliant on high leverage. Crypto exchanges often offer leverage ratios as high as 100x or more, making positions incredibly sensitive to price fluctuations. The suddenness of this particular crypto futures liquidation spree suggests a critical support level was breached, or a significant sell order flooded the market, triggering a chain reaction few could react to in real-time. Who Was Most Affected by This Crypto Futures Liquidation Wave? When such a large-scale crypto futures liquidation event occurs, it’s natural to wonder who bears the brunt. While exact breakdowns are proprietary, we can infer some general patterns. During sharp price downturns, “long” positions (traders betting on price increase) are primarily liquidated. Conversely, during sudden price surges, “short” positions are liquidated. Given the nature of a sudden drop often accompanying th"

After enduring a challenging four-day streak of net outflows, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs have made an astounding comeback, recording a robust total net inflow of $226.66 million. This significant turnaround has ignited fresh optimism across the digital asset landscape, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment and highlighting the enduring appeal of Bitcoin as a foundational asset in the evolving financial ecosystem. For anyone tracking the pulse of the crypto market, this resurgence in Bitcoin ETFs is a compelling story of resilience and renewed confidence. Understanding the Power of Spot Bitcoin ETFs Before diving deeper into the recent inflows, it is essential to grasp what spot Bitcoin ETFs are and why they hold such immense importance in the financial world. A spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin. This means that when you invest in such an ETF, you are indirectly gaining exposure to the actual price movements of Bitcoin without having to directly buy, store, or secure the cryptocurrency yourself. This structure offers several compelling advantages: Accessibility: Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin through regulated brokerage accounts, simplifying the investment process significantly. This removes the complexities often associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets. Regulatory Clarity: Operating within a regulated framework, these ETFs provide a layer of investor protection and oversight that might be perceived as lacking in direct crypto investments. This regulatory stamp of approval can attract institutional investors and more conservative retail investors. Liquidity: Traded on major stock exchanges, these ETFs offer high liquidity, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares throughout the trading day. Diversification (Indirect): For traditional portfolios, adding exposure to Bitcoin via an ETF can offer diversification benefits, as Bitcoin’s price movements can sometimes be uncorrelated with traditional assets. The introduction and subsequent performance of these funds have been closely watched, as they represent a crucial bridge between conventional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. Their ability to attract significant capital flows is a strong indicator of broader market acceptance and institutional interest in Bitcoin. The July 24th Resurgence: A Closer Look at Bitcoin ETFs Performance The data for July 24th, meticulously tracked and shared by Trader T on X, paints a vivid picture of this remarkable recovery. The total net inflow of $226.66 million not only snapped a four-day outflow streak but also demonstrated a strong appetite for Bitcoin exposure among investors. This influx of capital suggests a renewed bullish sentiment, or at least a pause in the previous trend of profit-taking or risk-aversion. Let’s break down which funds led this impressive charge, showcasing the diverse range of players actively participating in the Bitcoin ETFs market: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflows (Millions USD) FBTC Fidelity $106.58 HODL VanEck $46.36 IBIT BlackRock $32.53 BITB Bitwise $29.83 BTC Grayscale (mini) $7.91 EZBC Franklin Templeton $3.45 Fidelity’s FBTC led the pack by a significant margin, pulling in over $100 million, underscoring its growing prominence in the spot Bitcoin ETFs arena. VanEck’s HODL also demonstrated strong performance, securing the second spot. Even BlackRock’s IBIT, a powerhouse in the ETF space, contributed substantially to the positive figures. The participation of multiple issuers, each attracting notable inflows, highlights the broad-based interest in these investment vehicles. Decoding the Significance: Why Inflows are Crucial for Bitcoin ETFs and the Broader Market The return to net inflows for Bitcoin ETFs is more than just a daily statistic; it carries profound implications for the entire cryptocurrency market. Here’s why this trend is so crucial: Validation of Institutional Interest: Sustained inflows demonstrate that institutional investors, financial advisors, and even large retail investors are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to Bitcoin through regulated products. This validates Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. Impact on Bitcoin’s Price: While not a direct causation, consistent inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs can create buying pressure on the underlying asset. As ETFs acquire more Bitcoin to back their shares, it can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially contributing to price appreciation.

Analyst Links Binance Spot Volume Surges To Price Upswings,"Bitcoin (BTC) may be on the cusp of another rally, as leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance saw its spot volume rise from around 40% on July 15 to as high as 60% on July 18. Historical data suggests that surges in Binance’s spot market share have frequently preceded upward movements in BTC’s price. Bitcoin Rally Imminent? Binance Data Suggests So According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, Binance’s spot volume market share surging to 58% on July 23, has further strengthened the premier cryptocurrency’s $117,000 support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Long-Term Holders Sell As Short-Term Buyers Step In – Sign Of Rally Exhaustion? This marks the second notable spike in Binance’s spot market dominance this month. On July 18, Binance’s share surged to 60%, coinciding with Bitcoin holding above the critical $117,000 mark on the daily chart. Since then, the $117,000 level has served as a reliable support zone, likely buoyed by Binance’s deep liquidity and high execution reliability. Price stability at this level has been observed multiple times since the initial breakout. In addition to this, Bitcoin’s price has shown strong resilience around the Realized Price of the 1-day to 1-week Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) Age Band, which is currently near $118,300. For context, UTXO age bands classify Bitcoin held in wallets based on how long it has remained unspent, offering insight into investor behavior. Shorter bands – 1 day to 1 week – typically reflect activity by newer or speculative holders, while longer bands – 6 months to 5 years – are associated with long-term holders with stronger conviction. Taha explained: Historically, this metric acts as a dynamic support level, indicating that newer holders are not capitulating and that the average on-chain cost basis of recent buyers is being respected by the market. Meanwhile, fellow crypto analyst Titan of Crypto took to X to highlight BTC following the bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern.

2025-07-25 04:10:23+00:00,Bitcoin Transfer: Unpacking Galaxy Digital’s Massive $404M Move and Its Market Impact,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Transfer: Unpacking Galaxy Digital’s Massive $404M Move and Its Market Impact The cryptocurrency world is no stranger to significant movements, but when a prominent player like Galaxy Digital makes a substantial Bitcoin transfer , it certainly grabs attention. Recently, the crypto financial firm executed a staggering $404 million Bitcoin transfer to multiple centralized exchanges, a move that has sparked considerable discussion and speculation across the digital asset landscape. This kind of large-scale activity, often termed ‘whale movements,’ is closely monitored by investors and analysts for its potential implications on market liquidity, sentiment, and future price action. Understanding the nuances of this particular Bitcoin transfer is crucial for anyone keen on deciphering the complex signals within the crypto market. Unpacking Galaxy Digital’s Strategic Bitcoin Transfer: What Exactly Happened? In a series of rapid transactions, Galaxy Digital, a well-known name in institutional crypto services, made two distinct, massive Bitcoin transfer operations. According to on-chain data provided by Arkham Intelligence, these movements unfolded swiftly, leaving market observers to ponder their intent and potential impact. Initial Exchange Deposit: The first and largest Bitcoin transfer involved 3,500 BTC, valued at approximately $404 million at the time, moved to several centralized exchanges. This action typically suggests an intent to increase liquidity, potentially for selling, rebalancing portfolios, or facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals. The sheer volume of this deposit is what immediately caught the eye of the market. Subsequent Anonymous Transfer: Shortly after the initial deposit, Galaxy Digital executed another significant Bitcoin transfer of 1,500 BTC, roughly $176 million, to six anonymous addresses. This second movement introduces an element of mystery, as transfers to unknown wallets could indicate various strategies, including cold storage for security, internal treasury management, or preparation for future private transactions away from public exchange order books. These dual movements underscore the sophisticated nature of institutional crypto operations, where large sums are moved with specific strategic objectives. The timing and destination of these funds are key indicators for analysts attempting to predict market shifts. Why Does a Large Bitcoin Transfer Matter? Understanding Whale Movements When entities like Galaxy Digital move such colossal amounts of Bitcoin, it’s not just another transaction; it’s a ‘whale movement’ that can send ripples through the market. But why are these large-scale Bitcoin transfer events so significant? Potential Market Impact: Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern when large amounts of BTC are sent to exchanges is the potential for selling. If these Bitcoins are indeed sold, it could increase supply on exchanges, potentially leading to downward price pressure, especially if demand doesn’t match the increased supply. Liquidity Management: Institutions often need to manage their liquidity. Moving Bitcoin to exchanges might be a preparatory step for converting BTC into fiat or other cryptocurrencies to meet operational needs, invest in new assets, or fulfill client redemption requests. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Not all Bitcoin moved to exchanges is for immediate public sale. Sometimes, large holders facilitate OTC deals, where large blocks of crypto are traded directly between parties without impacting public exchange order books. However, the initial deposit to an exchange might be a precursor to such a deal. Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutional investors frequently rebalance their portfolios to manage risk or adjust exposure to different assets based on market conditions or strategic outlooks. A large Bitcoin transfer could be part of a broader rebalancing strategy. Market Sentiment: Large movements can influence market psychology. If interpreted as a sign of impending sell-offs, it can trigger fear (FUD) among retail investors, potentially leading to broader market declines. Conversely, if interpreted as strategic positioning for future growth, it could boost confidence. Understanding the ‘why’ behind a major Bitcoin transfer requires looking beyond the raw data and considering the broader context of the firm’s operations and market conditions. The Role of On-Chain Analytics: Peeking Behind the Bitcoin Transfer Curtain How do we even know about these massive transfers? This is where on-chain analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence become indispensable. These tools provide unparalleled transparency into the otherwise opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. What On-Chain Data Reveals: Transaction Details: On-chain data logs every transaction, including sender and receiver addresses, amounts, and timestamps.

This kind of large-scale activity, often termed ‘whale movements,’ is closely monitored by investors and analysts for its potential implications on market liquidity, sentiment, and future price action. Understanding the nuances of this particular Bitcoin transfer is crucial for anyone keen on deciphering the complex signals within the crypto market. Unpacking Galaxy Digital’s Strategic Bitcoin Transfer: What Exactly Happened? In a series of rapid transactions, Galaxy Digital, a well-known name in institutional crypto services, made two distinct, massive Bitcoin transfer operations. According to on-chain data provided by Arkham Intelligence, these movements unfolded swiftly, leaving market observers to ponder their intent and potential impact. Initial Exchange Deposit: The first and largest Bitcoin transfer involved 3,500 BTC, valued at approximately $404 million at the time, moved to several centralized exchanges. This action typically suggests an intent to increase liquidity, potentially for selling, rebalancing portfolios, or facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) deals. The sheer volume of this deposit is what immediately caught the eye of the market. Subsequent Anonymous Transfer: Shortly after the initial deposit, Galaxy Digital executed another significant Bitcoin transfer of 1,500 BTC, roughly $176 million, to six anonymous addresses. This second movement introduces an element of mystery, as transfers to unknown wallets could indicate various strategies, including cold storage for security, internal treasury management, or preparation for future private transactions away from public exchange order books. These dual movements underscore the sophisticated nature of institutional crypto operations, where large sums are moved with specific strategic objectives. The timing and destination of these funds are key indicators for analysts attempting to predict market shifts. Why Does a Large Bitcoin Transfer Matter? Understanding Whale Movements When entities like Galaxy Digital move such colossal amounts of Bitcoin, it’s not just another transaction; it’s a ‘whale movement’ that can send ripples through the market. But why are these large-scale Bitcoin transfer events so significant? Potential Market Impact: Selling Pressure: The most immediate concern when large amounts of BTC are sent to exchanges is the potential for selling. If these Bitcoins are indeed sold, it could increase supply on exchanges, potentially leading to downward price pressure, especially if demand doesn’t match the increased supply. Liquidity Management: Institutions often need to manage their liquidity. Moving Bitcoin to exchanges might be a preparatory step for converting BTC into fiat or other cryptocurrencies to meet operational needs, invest in new assets, or fulfill client redemption requests. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deals: Not all Bitcoin moved to exchanges is for immediate public sale. Sometimes, large holders facilitate OTC deals, where large blocks of crypto are traded directly between parties without impacting public exchange order books. However, the initial deposit to an exchange might be a precursor to such a deal. Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutional investors frequently rebalance their portfolios to manage risk or adjust exposure to different assets based on market conditions or strategic outlooks. A large Bitcoin transfer could be part of a broader rebalancing strategy. Market Sentiment: Large movements can influence market psychology. If interpreted as a sign of impending sell-offs, it can trigger fear (FUD) among retail investors, potentially leading to broader market declines. Conversely, if interpreted as strategic positioning for future growth, it could boost confidence. Understanding the ‘why’ behind a major Bitcoin transfer requires looking beyond the raw data and considering the broader context of the firm’s operations and market conditions. The Role of On-Chain Analytics: Peeking Behind the Bitcoin Transfer Curtain How do we even know about these massive transfers? This is where on-chain analytics platforms like Arkham Intelligence become indispensable. These tools provide unparalleled transparency into the otherwise opaque world of cryptocurrency transactions. What On-Chain Data Reveals: Transaction Details: On-chain data logs every transaction, including sender and receiver addresses, amounts, and timestamps. This allows analysts to track the flow of funds across the blockchain. Entity Identification: Advanced analyti"

In a significant development that underscores growing institutional confidence, U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a staggering total net inflow of $231.23 million on July 24. This marks an impressive streak, being the 15th consecutive day of net inflows, a testament to the increasing appetite for regulated cryptocurrency investment products. For anyone watching the evolution of crypto, this sustained momentum for Spot Ethereum ETFs is a clear signal of shifting tides. Unpacking the Phenomenal Inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs The recent data, shared by astute market observer Trader T on X, paints a vivid picture of which players are leading the charge in the burgeoning Spot Ethereum ETFs market. While the overall figure is substantial, a closer look reveals the individual contributions that collectively pushed the net inflows past the quarter-billion-dollar mark. Fidelity’s FETH emerged as the dominant force, pulling in a massive $210.06 million. This substantial figure alone highlights Fidelity’s strong position and investor trust in their offering. Following Fidelity, Grayscale’s mini ETH saw a notable inflow of $25.34 million, indicating a healthy interest in their more accessible product. Bitwise’s ETHW also contributed significantly with $11.53 million, and Franklin’s EZET added $2.84 million to the positive ledger. However, it wasn’t all green; Grayscale’s ETHE, a converted trust, experienced an $18.54 million outflow, suggesting some investors might be reallocating from the older trust structure to newer, perhaps more efficient, ETF vehicles. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, indicating stability in their current investor base. To better visualize the contributions, here’s a breakdown of the inflows and outflows for the day: ETF Ticker Provider Net Inflow/Outflow (Millions USD) FETH Fidelity +$210.06 mini ETH Grayscale +$25.34 ETHW Bitwise +$11.53 EZET Franklin +$2.84 ETHE Grayscale -$18.54 Others Various $0.00 Total Net Inflow +$231.23 This consistent inflow streak underscores a fundamental shift in how traditional finance views digital assets, particularly Ethereum. It suggests that institutional players and sophisticated investors are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to regulated crypto products, viewing them as legitimate components of a diversified portfolio. What’s Fueling the Institutional Appetite for Spot Ethereum ETFs? The consistent and substantial inflows into Spot Ethereum ETFs are not happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are converging to create this surge in institutional interest. Understanding these drivers is crucial for grasping the broader implications for the cryptocurrency market. Regulatory Clarity and SEC Approval: The most significant catalyst has undoubtedly been the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs . This landmark decision provides a much-needed layer of legitimacy and regulatory clarity that was previously absent. For institutional investors, regulatory approval significantly de-risks their participation, opening doors to funds and mandates that previously could not touch direct crypto holdings. Ethereum’s Robust Ecosystem: Beyond just being a digital currency, Ethereum boasts a vibrant and continuously evolving ecosystem. It is the backbone for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and countless decentralized applications (dApps). Its transition to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism has also made it more energy-efficient and scalable, appealing to environmentally conscious investors and those looking for long-term sustainability. Diversification and Portfolio Enhancement: As institutions become more comfortable with Bitcoin as an alternative asset, Ethereum offers a compelling diversification play within the digital asset space. Its distinct use cases and economic model differentiate it from Bitcoin, potentially offering uncorrelated returns or unique growth opportunities within a broader digital asset allocation strategy. Accessibility and Familiarity: ETFs provide a familiar and accessible investment vehicle for traditional investors. They can buy and sell shares of Spot Ethereum ETFs through their existing brokerage accounts, bypassing the complexities of direct crypto custody, wallet management, and navigating decentralized exchanges. This ease of access significantly lowers the barrier to entry for a wide range of investors.

Key Takeaways: BitMine has become the largest corporate holder of Ether, acquiring over $2 billion worth in just 16 days. The firm aims to stake 5% of the total Ether supply, a target worth around $22 billion. Corporate Ether treasuries are rising rapidly, with BitMine and SharpLink leading a new wave of accumulation. The Bitcoin mining company announced it had purchased 566,776 Ether over a 16-day span, amounting to approximately $2.03 billion at current prices. The aggressive move has vaulted BitMine ahead of rivals in the fast-growing race to build strategic Ether treasuries. BitMine Aims to Stake 5% of Total Ether Supply, Says Chairman Tom Lee Tom Lee, managing partner at FundStrat and chairman of BitMine, said the firm is targeting an ambitious goal — to acquire and stake 5% of the total Ether supply. At today’s estimates, that would amount to roughly six million ETH, or about $22 billion. Ether’s supply is elastic due to its burn mechanism, making this a moving target. If successful, BitMine would control a larger share of Ether than MicroStrategy holds in Bitcoin. Michael Saylor’s firm owns 607,770 BTC, or 2.9% of Bitcoin’s capped 21 million supply.

2025-07-25 05:00:54+00:00,This Bitcoin Metric Often Flags Turning Points—What’s It Saying Now?,"The Bitcoin short-term holder balance has often shown shifts near market tops and bottoms. Here’s what the metric’s trend is signaling right now. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder Balance Hasn’t Seen Any Major Shifts Recently In a new post on X, institutional DeFi solutions provider Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) has shared a chart that shows how the holdings of the different Bitcoin investor groups has changed over the years. The cohorts in question have been divided on the basis of holding time. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Near $1 Billion As XRP, Dogecoin Crash 10% The analytics firm classifies investors into three groups: traders, cruisers, and hodlers. The traders include the holders who have been carrying their coins for less than a month. This group corresponds to the new entrants in the sector and the investors who participate in high frequency trades. The cruisers are investors who are no longer that short-term minded, but they also haven’t built up enough resilience to be in it for the long-term yet. Cruisers who manage to hold past the one year mark become part of the diamond hands of the network: the hodlers. Now, below is the chart for the net change in the supply held by these three Bitcoin groups. As displayed in the above graph, these cohorts have historically shown a certain pattern near inflection points in the asset. “Fluctuations in short-term holder balances often signal market turning points,” notes the analytics firm. During major tops and bottoms, the traders generally register a sharp spike in their balance, as cruisers and hodlers take part in profit realization or capitulation. Whenever these older groups sell, the age of their coins resets back to zero and they are put into the supply of the traders. From the chart, it’s apparent that while Bitcoin has observed a sharp rally to new all-time highs (ATHs) recently, there still hasn’t been any big changes in the supplies of the traders. “Interestingly, we’re not seeing major shifts at the moment,” says Sentora. It now remains to be seen whether this means that the current rally still has room to grow. Related Reading: When Will Ethereum Turn Overheated? Report Says Watch This Level In some other news, the cryptocurrency has seen an uptick in on-chain transaction activity, as the analytics firm has pointed out in another X post.

This one is much larger than last week’s expiry, being an end-of-month event, but unlikely to be enough to influence spot markets, which have been on the back foot for most of the week. “Last month’s H1 expiry hit $17 billion. This week is not far behind, with over $15 billion in BTC and ETH options expiring,” observed Deribit. Bitcoin Options Expiry This week’s big batch of Bitcoin options contracts has a put/call ratio of 0.88, meaning that there are more calls expiring than put contracts. There is also a max pain point of $112,000, around $4,000 below current spot prices, which is where most losses will be made on contract expiry. Open interest (OI), or the value or number of BTC options contracts yet to expire, is highest at $140,000, which has surged to over $3 billion at this strike price. There is also more than $2 billion OI at $120,000 and $130,000 strike prices as the bull speculators load up on contracts.

The firm has created a specialized team of lawyers, analysts, and crypto experts to handle digital asset transactions, the New York Times reported on Thursday. Christie’s CEO Aaron Kirman said that the division was launched after closing several high-profile crypto transactions. One notable deal involved the purchase of a $65 million property in Beverly Hills using Bitcoin . “The trend was obvious — crypto is here to stay. It’s only going to get bigger over the next few years,” Kirman told the Times. The crypto division will facilitate high-value real estate deals without banks or fiat. Christie’s $1B Worth Real Estate Portfolio Kirman said that he now has a portfolio of homes worth more than $1 billion, whose sellers are willing to accept crypto. Included in the portfolio is Invisible House in Joshua Tree, priced at about $18 million with a design featuring reflective walls. According to Kirman, crypto could account for more than one-third of all residential property sales in the US within five years. Chris Hanley, the owner of Invisible House said that crypto payments “signals an openness to innovative buyers,” including crypto millionaires looking for real-world assets to diversify. Crypto Milestone Signals ‘Speculative to Serious’ Portfolio Shift The crypto space is experiencing a trifecta of regulatory clarity, macro easing, and corporate adoption, driving institutional adoption. The shift is pushing crypto from speculative asset to serious portfolio contender, James Harris, the newly appointed CEO of Tesseract Group of digital asset firms, told Cryptonews. “The recent U.S. ‘Crypto Week’ breakthroughs — especially the passage of the GENIUS Act (now signed into law) and the movement of the CLARITY and Anti-CBDC bills through Congress — have acted as a major catalyst,” Harris noted. “These developments mark a shift away from regulation-by-enforcement and toward clear, supportive frameworks, which has emboldened institutional investors.” Further, broader economic conditions and corporate treasuries are also helping push crypto as a natural beneficiary, he added.

2025-07-25 05:28:07+00:00,Billions of Dollars Have Flowed Into Cryptocurrencies Since the Beginning of the Year: JPMorgan Analysts Release Statement,"According to JPMorgan analysts, capital inflows into digital assets since the beginning of the year have reached $60 billion. This increase was driven by cryptocurrency fund flows, activity in CME futures, and a resurgence in venture capital investment. Inflows have increased by approximately 50% since the end of May, and this year''s total is projected to easily surpass last year''s record. The analyst team, led by JPMorgan''s managing director Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, cited the shift in attitudes toward cryptocurrency regulation, particularly in the US, as the primary driver of this growth. The GENIUS Act, passed by Congress and providing legal clarity for stablecoins, positions the US as a global standard-setter while also pushing other countries to compete. China is accelerating its digital yuan development, while efforts in Hong Kong to develop a yuan-backed stablecoin are attracting attention. The CLARITY Act, a bill aiming to define whether digital assets are considered securities or commodities, is also progressing through Congress in the US. Analysts believe this regulation could make the US more attractive to crypto-native companies compared to the European Union''s MiCA regulation. Related News: BREAKING: Major Update to Binance-listed Altcoin Causes Price Surge The effects of these regulatory developments are beginning to be felt in both the private and public crypto markets. While venture capital investment is experiencing a resurgence, public markets are also experiencing renewed momentum. JPMorgan analysts cited Circle''s successful IPO and the wave of new filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission as examples of this trend. They also noted that the stock price of MicroStrategy''s rebranded company, Strategy, continues to trade significantly above the company''s Bitcoin holdings. Investor interest in altcoins is also growing. Ethereum''s dominance in DeFi and smart contracts, along with its inclusion alongside Bitcoin in institutional treasuries, are cited as factors driving this interest.

2025-07-25 05:30:00+00:00,BlackRock’s ETHA Becomes Third Fastest ETF to Hit $10B,"The fund doubled from $5 billion to $10 billion in just 10 days—a growth Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas called a “God candle.” This surge shed some light on the rising dominance of spot crypto ETFs, with ETHA trailing only BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. Meanwhile, Ethereum ETFs are experiencing strong capital inflows, pulling in $4.4 billion over the past two weeks. Despite the bullish momentum, 10x Research warns that Ethereum may face short-term headwinds due to overbought conditions and rising wETH borrowing costs. Historically, however, Ethereum performs strongest in Q4. ETHA Breaks $10 Billion BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) officially joined the ranks of the fastest-growing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in history. According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas , ETHA reached $10 billion in assets under management (AUM) just 251 days after its launch. Even more remarkable, the fund surged from $5 billion to $10 billion in only 10 days—a momentum Balchunas described as the ETF equivalent of a “God candle.” This refers to a massive, rapid upward movement typically seen in trading charts. This rapid ascent places ETHA as the third-fastest ETF to reach the $10 billion milestone, ahead of other well known traditional finance products like the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ), which took 444 days to hit the same mark. The top two positions are occupied by other spot crypto ETFs: BlackRock’s own iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which reached $10 billion in just 34 days after its January 2024 debut, and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC), which did so in 54 days. Nate Geraci , president of NovaDius Wealth Management, pointed out that this feat by ETHA proves the growing dominance of spot crypto ETFs in an industry that spans over three decades and includes close to 4,400 different products. ETHA’s surge also coincides with a sharp uptick in investor interest in Ethereum-based funds. Data from SoSoValue reveals that Ether ETFs in the United States experienced a consistent 14-day inflow streak , pulling in $4.4 billion in net capital since July 3. Ethereum ETF flow (Source: Farside Investors ) This streak includes a single-day record inflow of $726.7 million—which was the highest daily total since ETHA’s debut last year. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs, which were also recently on a 12-day inflow streak, have now entered a period of decline after registering $289 million in outflows over the past three trading sessions. This shift could mean that there is a potential rotation in investor focus from Bitcoin to Ethereum as momentum builds in the latter''s ETF market. Ethereum May Struggle Through Q3 Despite its current momentum, Ethereum may be facing a turbulent period in the near term as market indicators suggest vulnerability and rising costs associated with borrowing wrapped Ether (wETH) on DeFi platforms. According to Markus Thielen, head of research at 10x Research, Ethereum appears overbought and technically stretched, particularly as the market enters a traditionally quieter summer period in the US, especially in August. Thielen shared in an interview that technical indicators are signaling overvaluation, and combined with seasonal trading slowdowns, this could lead to increased volatility for Ethereum. At press time, ETH was trading hands at $3,596 after its price experienced a 1.78% drop over the past 24 hours of trading. The altcoins price was, however, still able to climb by more than 45% over the past month. ETH’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) One of the key concerns centers around the spike in variable borrowing costs for wETH. This tokenized form of Ether is used heavily in decentralized finance, and has become less attractive to traders as profitability wanes. Thielen’s market analysis mentioned that usage of lending platform Aave soared from 86% to 95% since July 8, which indicates that borrowing demand is now outpacing available supply. As a result, the cost to borrow wETH increased quite a bit, leading to the likelihood of position unwinding among those who borrowed ETH to pursue yield-generating strategies. Many of these traders have been engaging in “looping” strategies, where borrowed ETH is used to stake and then borrow again to enhance returns. These strategies are only viable when borrowing rates stay low and the stETH-to-ETH peg holds steady. However, with over 90% of ETH loans utilizing variable interest rates, borrowers are now very vulnerable to rapidly rising borrowing costs. If these elevated rates persist, Thielen warns that it could have much wider implications for the Ethereum ecosystem.

Recently, the digital asset space has been abuzz with significant activity from a prominent player: Galaxy Digital. A recent development, signaling a potential Galaxy Digital BTC offload , has captured the attention of traders and investors alike, prompting a closer look at its implications for Bitcoin and the broader market. This isn’t just another transaction; it’s a massive withdrawal of 370 million USDT from leading exchanges, an event that on-chain analytics suggest could be linked to the offloading of a substantial 10,000 BTC. Understanding the Galaxy Digital BTC Offload Signal The core of this developing story comes from Lookonchain, a well-respected on-chain analytics platform. They recently alerted the crypto community via X (formerly Twitter) about Galaxy Digital’s significant movements. Over a mere three-hour period, a staggering 370 million USDT was withdrawn from major exchanges including OKX, Binance, and Bybit. But what does a large USDT withdrawal signify, and why is it being interpreted as a potential Galaxy Digital BTC offload ? In the world of cryptocurrency, Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. When a large entity like Galaxy Digital moves such a substantial amount of USDT off exchanges, it often indicates one of two primary scenarios: Preparing for an OTC (Over-The-Counter) Sale: Large institutional players frequently execute trades through OTC desks rather than directly on public exchanges. This allows them to move massive volumes without causing significant price slippage. To facilitate an OTC sale of Bitcoin, they would typically need a large amount of stablecoin liquidity, which they might withdraw from exchanges to their private wallets or directly to the OTC desk’s wallet. Reducing Exposure to Exchanges: Institutions might also withdraw stablecoins to reduce their exposure to exchange risks, opting to hold assets in cold storage or private wallets. However, given the concurrent market drop, the former scenario seems more plausible in this context. Lookonchain’s assessment points directly to the first scenario, linking these USDT withdrawals to a suspected offload of 10,000 BTC. This is a considerable sum, representing millions of dollars in Bitcoin, and such a move by a major firm like Galaxy Digital could certainly send ripples across the market. The Immediate Impact: Bitcoin’s Price Reaction to the Galaxy Digital BTC Offload The timing of these significant transfers couldn’t be more critical. In the eight hours following the reported withdrawals, Bitcoin experienced a noticeable decline, dropping more than 3% in value. While correlation does not always equal causation, the proximity of these events suggests a strong link. Large institutional sell-offs, or even the anticipation of them, can exert significant downward pressure on asset prices, especially in a market as sensitive as cryptocurrency. Let’s consider the potential mechanisms at play: Supply Increase: If Galaxy Digital indeed offloaded 10,000 BTC, this would represent a sudden increase in the available supply of Bitcoin on the market, even if conducted OTC. Increased supply, without a corresponding increase in demand, typically leads to price depreciation. Market Sentiment: News of a major institutional player potentially selling off a large portion of their holdings can trigger a wave of negative sentiment. Other investors, fearing further drops, might panic sell, exacerbating the downward trend. This “fear factor” is a powerful driver in crypto markets. Liquidity Dynamics: Large withdrawals of stablecoins from exchanges can also impact liquidity. While USDT is primarily used for trading, its movement off exchanges might signal a shift in institutional strategy that indirectly affects overall market liquidity for Bitcoin. This immediate price reaction underscores the influence that major institutional players like Galaxy Digital wield. Their actions are closely watched, and for good reason, as they often precede significant market shifts. Why Does a Galaxy Digital BTC Offload Matter So Much? The cryptocurrency market has matured significantly, with institutional participation growing steadily. Firms like Galaxy Digital are not just passive investors; they are active participants, market makers, and influential voices. When a firm of this stature makes a substantial move, it sends a powerful message. But why is a potential Galaxy Digital BTC offload of 10,000 BTC particularly noteworthy?

This isn’t a distant dream, but a compelling projection by industry leaders like Feng Wang, co-founder and CEO of Hong Kong-listed game developer Linekong Interactive. Wang’s vision, shared via X, paints a vivid picture of a world where digital assets are not just an alternative investment but an integral part of corporate operations, signaling a profound shift in the global economic landscape. The Inevitable March Towards Institutional Corporate Crypto Adoption Feng Wang’s assertion that the institutionalization of Bitcoin and Ethereum is an ‘inevitable trend’ resonates deeply within the crypto community. For years, digital assets were seen as niche, volatile, and primarily for retail investors. However, the tide has turned dramatically. Large financial institutions, corporations, and even sovereign nations are increasingly recognizing the foundational value of blockchain technology and its flagship cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin’s Maturation: Often dubbed ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin’s finite supply and decentralized nature make it an attractive hedge against inflation and a store of value. Institutional interest, evidenced by Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasury allocations, solidifies its position as a legitimate asset class. Ethereum’s Utility: Beyond being a digital currency, Ethereum serves as the backbone for countless decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi protocols, and NFTs. Its programmable nature offers immense potential for enterprise solutions, smart contracts, and supply chain management, making it indispensable for future business models. Global Acceptance: As regulatory frameworks evolve and clarity emerges, more businesses will feel confident integrating these assets, moving from speculative interest to strategic adoption. Will Stablecoins Truly Permeate Every Industry? Wang’s projection extends to stablecoins, suggesting their eventual entry into ‘all industries and companies.’ This isn’t a far-fetched idea. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar, offer the speed and efficiency of blockchain transactions without the volatility inherent in assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Their utility for businesses is immense: Cross-Border Payments: Traditional international payments are slow and expensive. Stablecoins can facilitate near-instant, low-cost global transactions, revolutionizing trade and supply chain finance. Payroll and Employee Compensation: Companies with international workforces could use stablecoins to pay employees, simplifying conversions and reducing fees. Treasury Management: Holding a portion of corporate reserves in stablecoins could offer liquidity and easy access to digital asset markets, while mitigating volatility risks. Enhanced Financial Services: For industries like lending, insurance, and remittances, stablecoins offer a robust, transparent, and efficient medium for transactions and operations. The key to widespread stablecoin adoption lies in regulatory clarity and widespread acceptance by payment processors and financial intermediaries. As these pieces fall into place, the vision of stablecoins underpinning daily business operations becomes increasingly plausible. The Evolution: From Stocks to Tokens Through Corporate Crypto Adoption Perhaps the most transformative aspect of Wang’s vision is the idea of ‘tokenization of stocks’ not only merging traditional stocks and digital tokens but ultimately evolving towards ‘tokens replacing stocks.’ This concept, often referred to as security token offerings (STOs) or digital securities, leverages blockchain to represent ownership of real-world assets, including company equity. How Tokenization Could Reshape Finance: Feature Traditional Stocks Tokenized Stocks (Security Tokens) Accessibility Limited to specific trading hours, exchanges, and investor types. 24/7 global trading, fractional ownership possible, lower barriers to entry for investors. Liquidity Can be illiquid for private companies; dependent on market makers. Potentially higher liquidity due to fractionalization and broader investor base. Transparency Centralized ledgers, less direct visibility for investors. Blockchain-based, immutable records, enhanced transparency of ownership. Cost & Efficiency High intermediary fees, complex settlement processes. Reduced fees, faster settlement (T+0 or T+1), automated compliance via smart contracts. Fractional Ownership Typically not possible for individual shares. Allows investors to own fractions of high-value assets (e.g., a fraction of a Google share). The transition won’t be overnight.

With Bitcoin (BTC) price dropping below $116,000 and Ethereum (ETH) price consolidating near $3,600, the entire market cap has contracted by nearly 4% in 24 hours. However, this is not just about prices—underlying forces like regulatory uncertainty, leverage flush-outs, and altcoin volatility are at play. Altcoin Sell-off Deepens: Pressure on Broader Market The sharpest losses today are centered around the altcoins, as the ones in the top 10 have attracted significant loss. According to the market data, 48 of the top 100 altcoins are in red by more than 10%. XRP price also plunged by over 12% in the past couple of days, triggering over $112 million in liquidations from long positions. These abrupt liquidations sparked a cascade of forced selling, amplifying volatility across exchanges. On the other hand, the Bitcoin price dropped heavily from the daily highs over $118,400 to as low as $115,100 hinting towards a massive drop in the strength of the bulls. However, they managed to reclaim the local support at $115,260 and helped the price to rise above $115,700 at the press time. Regardless of this, the bearish cloud is believed to hold hover over the BTC price rally and eventually the entire market for a while. What Fueled the Bearish Pullback? While macro conditions have improved globally, regulatory ambiguity in the U.S. is casting a long shadow over crypto sentiment. The U.S. Senate is currently evaluating bills like the Genius Act and broader crypto market structure frameworks. Although lawmakers have shown increasing openness toward Bitcoin and Ethereum, there’s still a lack of clarity on how altcoins and stablecoins will be treated. This fog has hit investor confidence, particularly among institutions and hedge funds seeking to diversify beyond BTC and ETH. The delay in approvals for altcoin ETFs—particularly Solana, XRP, and Polygon—has led to cautious repositioning. Until the U.S. finalizes its stance on non-BTC crypto assets, speculative appetite in altcoins will remain under pressure. What’s Next? Will the Markets Close the Monthly Trade on a Bearish Note? As July draws to a close, the crypto market is showing signs of weakness that may lead to a bearish monthly close. Bitcoin continues to trade below its critical 50-day EMA, with lower highs forming on the daily chart—an early signal of trend exhaustion. Ethereum is also struggling to maintain a bullish structure, with volume declining and momentum indicators like MACD and RSI pointing toward further downside. Altcoins remain heavily oversold, with most failing to reclaim key support zones after recent breakdowns. If Bitcoin closes the month below $118K, it could confirm a short-term bearish trend, potentially triggering a slide toward $112K or even $110K in early August. However, a strong recovery and close above $120K would invalidate this setup and potentially fuel a renewed rally. Until clear confirmation emerges, traders should expect choppy price action with downside risk dominating sentiment into the new month.

2025-07-25 05:45:23+00:00,Crucial Bitcoin Transfers: Galaxy Digital’s Massive BTC Movements Shake the Market,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Bitcoin Transfers: Galaxy Digital’s Massive BTC Movements Shake the Market The cryptocurrency world is abuzz once again as major institutional players make significant moves. Fresh on the heels of a substantial USDT withdrawal, Galaxy Digital, a prominent name in crypto investment, has executed another colossal transaction: a transfer of 2,850 Bitcoin (BTC) – valued at approximately $330.44 million – to various exchanges. This crucial Bitcoin transfer , first flagged by the vigilant eyes of on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, raises immediate questions about its potential implications for the market. Who is Galaxy Digital and Why Do Their Bitcoin Transfers Matter? Founded by Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital stands as a diversified financial services and investment management company dedicated to the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors. Their activities, ranging from trading and asset management to principal investments and advisory services, position them as a bellwether for institutional sentiment and activity within the crypto space. When an entity of Galaxy Digital’s stature makes such a significant move, especially involving Bitcoin , the market tends to pay close attention, seeking to understand the underlying motives and potential ripple effects. These large-scale Bitcoin transfers are often seen as indicators of broader institutional strategies. The Power of On-Chain Analytics: Unveiling Hidden Movements In the transparent world of blockchain, every transaction leaves an indelible mark. This is where on-chain analytics firms like Lookonchain become invaluable. By meticulously tracking wallet movements, they provide real-time insights into the flow of digital assets, offering a window into the strategies of whales and institutional entities. Lookonchain’s swift identification of Galaxy Digital’s latest Bitcoin transfers underscores the critical role these tools play in demystifying market dynamics. Their ability to highlight such large-scale movements moments after they occur empowers traders and investors with data-driven perspectives, allowing for more informed decision-making in a rapidly moving market. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin Transfers: What Does it Mean for the Market? The transfer of a substantial amount of Bitcoin to exchanges is often interpreted as a precursor to selling. While not a definitive guarantee of immediate liquidation, it certainly signals an intent to increase liquidity or rebalance portfolios. For a firm like Galaxy Digital, such a move could be driven by several strategic considerations: Portfolio Rebalancing: Institutions frequently adjust their asset allocations based on market conditions, risk assessments, or investment mandates. Selling a portion of their Bitcoin holdings could be part of a broader strategy to diversify or reduce exposure to a single asset. Meeting Client Redemptions: As an investment firm, Galaxy Digital manages funds for various clients. Large transfers might be necessary to meet redemption requests from their investors, especially if clients are looking to lock in profits or shift capital into other asset classes. Capitalizing on Price Action: If the firm believes Bitcoin has reached a favorable price point, they might decide to take profits, securing gains for themselves or their clients. This is a common strategy in volatile markets, aiming to optimize returns. Funding New Ventures: Less likely for transfers to exchanges for immediate sale, but sometimes capital is raised from existing holdings to fund new investments or operational needs within the broader digital asset ecosystem, though this usually involves an OTC desk rather than direct exchange deposits. The sheer volume of this particular Bitcoin transfer – 2,850 BTC – makes it a noteworthy event. Combined with the earlier $370 million USDT withdrawal, it paints a picture of active and strategic capital management by Galaxy Digital, signaling a dynamic shift in their holdings. Historical Context: How Have Past Institutional Bitcoin Transfers Impacted the Market? History offers numerous examples of how large institutional Bitcoin transfers have influenced market sentiment and price action. While no two situations are identical, certain patterns often emerge when significant amounts of BTC move to or from exchanges: Short-Term Volatility: Significant inflows of BTC to exchanges can create downward pressure on prices as the supply available for sale increases. Traders often react swiftly to such signals, leading to short-term price fluctuations and increased market volatility. Market Confidence: Conversely, large withdrawals of BTC from exchanges to cold storage wallets are often seen as a bullish sign, indicating an intent to ‘HODL’ or accumulate for the long term, reducing immediate sell pressure.

2025-07-25 05:53:07+00:00,"Crypto Market Cap Drops Over 6% as Bitcoin, ETH and XRP Enter Red — What’s Going On?","The global crypto market took a sharp turn Friday, shedding about 6.7% in value and knocking over $160b off its total market cap, now hovering around $3.84 trillion, according to data from CoinGecko. The drop comes after four consecutive green weekly candles, suggesting the bullish momentum that carried digital assets to near-record highs is beginning to stall. Bitcoin , which had recently surged above $120,000, pulled back to around $115,300, registering a 2.6% drop over the past 24 hours. Ethereum fell 1.3% to $3,596, while XRP posted a steeper 3.6% daily loss, now trading at $3.07. The declines follow a broad market correction, driven by leveraged liquidations and shifting investor sentiment. Galaxy Digital Sparks Jitters With $1.5B Bitcoin Sell-Off Spree Further, Lookonchain said that Galaxy Digital offloaded 10,000 BTC, worth about $1.18b, putting serious pressure on the crypto market. It also pulled $370m in USDT from exchanges like OKX, Binance and Bybit, hinting at more sell-off plans. Bitcoin sell-off still underway! #GalaxyDigital deposited another 2,850 $BTC ($330.44M) to exchanges 11 minutes ago. https://t.co/lD8tgkC4Py https://t.co/T3wOpRSbnw pic.twitter.com/eJ4pEvDvOQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 25, 2025 Right after, Galaxy Digital moved another 2,850 BTC, valued at roughly $330.44m, to centralized exchanges. This suggests the firm is not done selling, and traders are bracing for more market swings soon. Massive Liquidations Hit ETH, BTC, and XRP Amid Market Crash Over $721m in leveraged positions were wiped out in the last 24 hours alone, according to liquidation tracker CoinGlass . Ethereum led the bloodbath with $163.9m in liquidations, followed closely by Bitcoin at $155.5m and XRP at nearly $49m. The spike in liquidations shows the vulnerability of traders heavily exposed to borrowed funds amid sudden price drops. Liquidation pressure mounted throughout the day, with nearly $273m worth of long positions cleared in the last 12 hours alone. The largest single liquidation order occurred on OKX’s BTC-USDT-SWAP market, valued at $17.35m. The sudden downturn marks a natural retracement after an extended rally. The crypto market cap had recently tested the $4 trillion mark, while altcoins enjoyed outsized gains during the surge. However, the Altcoin Season Index has since dropped to 40, suggesting a weakening trend for smaller-cap tokens relative to Bitcoin. Institutional activity remains a key factor in the current volatility. While ETF flows for Bitcoin continue to reflect long-term bullish interest, rotation strategies from firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity are believed to be causing temporary price dislocations. These moves, paired with macroeconomic uncertainty and profit-taking from whales, have weighed on short-term performance. Despite the downturn, retail sentiment remains surprisingly strong. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index continues to show “Greed,” hinting that many traders still view the correction as a buying opportunity rather than a bearish reversal. Crypto Volatility Persists as Traders Watch $116K BTC Level However, analysts caution that overly optimistic sentiment in the face of technical weakness can lead to further downside. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin has dipped below key support levels, with traders eyeing the $116,000 zone for signs of stabilization. Ethereum is also under pressure following a recent spike in its validator queue, a sign that network activity may be cooling. XRP, meanwhile, has broken below its near-term support, with potential to test the $2.72 mark if selling continues. Not all assets suffered losses. CoinGecko’s top gainers list included Vine, The Innovation Game and Pepecoin, up 44.7%, 46%, and 35% respectively, suggesting selective interest in niche tokens amid broader weakness. While some investors see the dip as a healthy correction, others remain cautious. With nearly 208,000 traders liquidated in a single day and rising volatility across major tokens, the road ahead looks choppy, even as long-term conviction holds strong.

It also pulled $370m in USDT from exchanges like OKX, Binance and Bybit, hinting at more sell-off plans. Bitcoin sell-off still underway! #GalaxyDigital deposited another 2,850 $BTC ($330.44M) to exchanges 11 minutes ago. https://t.co/lD8tgkC4Py https://t.co/T3wOpRSbnw pic.twitter.com/eJ4pEvDvOQ — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 25, 2025 Right after, Galaxy Digital moved another 2,850 BTC, valued at roughly $330.44m, to centralized exchanges. This suggests the firm is not done selling, and traders are bracing for more market swings soon. Massive Liquidations Hit ETH, BTC, and XRP Amid Market Crash Over $721m in leveraged positions were wiped out in the last 24 hours alone, according to liquidation tracker CoinGlass . Ethereum led the bloodbath with $163.9m in liquidations, followed closely by Bitcoin at $155.5m and XRP at nearly $49m. The spike in liquidations shows the vulnerability of traders heavily exposed to borrowed funds amid sudden price drops. Liquidation pressure mounted throughout the day, with nearly $273m worth of long positions cleared in the last 12 hours alone. The largest single liquidation order occurred on OKX’s BTC-USDT-SWAP market, valued at $17.35m. The sudden downturn marks a natural retracement after an extended rally. The crypto market cap had recently tested the $4 trillion mark, while altcoins enjoyed outsized gains during the surge. However, the Altcoin Season Index has since dropped to 40, suggesting a weakening trend for smaller-cap tokens relative to Bitcoin. Institutional activity remains a key factor in the current volatility. While ETF flows for Bitcoin continue to reflect long-term bullish interest, rotation strategies from firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity are believed to be causing temporary price dislocations. These moves, paired with macroeconomic uncertainty and profit-taking from whales, have weighed on short-term performance. Despite the downturn, retail sentiment remains surprisingly strong. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index continues to show “Greed,” hinting that many traders still view the correction as a buying opportunity rather than a bearish reversal. Crypto Volatility Persists as Traders Watch $116K BTC Level However, analysts caution that overly optimistic sentiment in the face of technical weakness can lead to further downside. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin has dipped below key support levels, with traders eyeing the $116,000 zone for signs of stabilization. Ethereum is also under pressure following a recent spike in its validator queue, a sign that network activity may be cooling. XRP, meanwhile, has broken below its near-term support, with potential to test the $2.72 mark if selling continues. Not all assets suffered losses. CoinGecko’s top gainers list included Vine, The Innovation Game and Pepecoin, up 44.7%, 46%, and 35% respectively, suggesting selective interest in niche tokens amid broader weakness. While some investors see the dip as a healthy correction, others remain cautious. With nearly 208,000 traders liquidated in a single day and rising volatility across major tokens, the road ahead looks choppy, even as long-term conviction holds strong.

2025-07-25 05:55:15+00:00,Lightning Network: A Transformative Leap Towards 5% Stablecoin Dominance by 2028,"BitcoinWorld Lightning Network: A Transformative Leap Towards 5% Stablecoin Dominance by 2028 The cryptocurrency world is constantly evolving, with innovations promising to reshape how we transact and interact with digital assets. Among the most exciting developments is the ongoing evolution of the Lightning Network , Bitcoin’s powerful layer-2 solution. Imagine a future where billions of dollars in stablecoin transactions flow through this network, not just Bitcoin. This isn’t a distant dream; it’s a bold prediction from a leading industry expert. Graham Krizek, CEO of Lightning payments provider Voltage, recently shared a fascinating vision with Cointelegraph: he believes the Lightning Network could astonishingly handle 5% of global stablecoin volume by 2028. This forecast signals a monumental shift, potentially making digital currency transactions faster, cheaper, and more accessible than ever before. The Lightning Network Explained: A Game-Changer for Transactions At its core, the Lightning Network is a “layer-2” payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Think of it as a superhighway constructed over a regular road. While Bitcoin’s main chain (the “road”) is incredibly secure and decentralized, it can sometimes be slow and costly for small, frequent transactions. The Lightning Network addresses these limitations by creating off-chain payment channels between users. This allows for: Instant Transactions: Payments settle almost immediately. Micro-payments: Extremely small amounts can be sent with negligible fees. Scalability: It can handle millions of transactions per second, far exceeding the main Bitcoin chain’s capacity. Historically, the Lightning Network has been primarily used for Bitcoin (BTC) transactions. However, the vision now extends to stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar (e.g., USDT, USDC). They combine the stability of traditional money with the advantages of blockchain technology. Integrating stablecoins with the Lightning Network could unlock unprecedented utility, merging the speed and low cost of Lightning with the price stability of fiat-pegged assets. Krizek’s Bold Forecast: Can Lightning Network Truly Capture 5% of Stablecoin Volume? Voltage CEO Graham Krizek’s prediction of the Lightning Network handling 5% of stablecoin volume by 2028 is a testament to the network’s burgeoning potential. To put this into perspective, the global stablecoin market capitalization currently hovers around hundreds of billions of dollars, with daily transaction volumes often exceeding that. A 5% share would represent a significant flow of capital, transforming the landscape of digital payments. Krizek’s optimism stems from several key factors: Growing Demand for Efficient Payments: Businesses and individuals worldwide seek faster, cheaper, and more reliable ways to send and receive money, especially across borders. Technological Advancements: Innovations like Taro (Taproot Asset Representation Overlay), developed by Lightning Labs, are making it technically feasible to issue and transfer stablecoins (and other assets) directly over the Lightning Network . These underlying technologies are paving the way for major stablecoins like USDT and USDC. Increasing Adoption of Bitcoin Layer-2: As more users and businesses embrace Bitcoin’s layer-2 solutions, the infrastructure and user base for stablecoin integration naturally expand. Emerging Regulatory Clarity: Clearer regulatory frameworks for stablecoins could bolster confidence and encourage wider institutional adoption, potentially leveraging Lightning for efficiency. Krizek anticipates a noticeable pickup in stablecoin activity on the network in the coming months, suggesting that the foundational work is already underway. Unlocking Potential: The Immense Benefits of Stablecoins on the Lightning Network The convergence of stablecoins and the Lightning Network offers a compelling suite of advantages that could revolutionize various financial activities. Imagine a world where: Benefit Description Unparalleled Speed Transactions settle in milliseconds, ideal for retail payments, online gaming, and real-time settlements. Near-Zero Fees Lightning fees are minuscule, often fractions of a cent, enabling efficient micro-transactions. Global Reach & Accessibility Anyone with an internet connection can send and receive stablecoins instantly, bypassing geographical barriers and banking hours. Enhanced Privacy Off-chain transactions offer a degree of privacy compared to on-chain transactions. Censorship Resistance Built on Bitcoin’s decentralized foundation, transactions are resistant to censorship or arbitrary freezing by central authorities. These benefits collectively paint a picture of a more efficient, inclusive, and user-friendly financial system, especially for use cases like cross-border payments, e-commerce, and payroll for global teams.

With large firms like BitMine, Sharplink Gaming , and Ether Machine collectively holding over 1.3 million ETH, a potential supply crunch may be in the making. Novogratz told CNBC that this surge in institutional interest could be the “secret sauce” pushing Ether past $4,000 in the coming months. Interestingly, raising the bull vibes, firms like BitMine, Sharplink Gaming, and The Ether Machine now hold billions in ETH in their treasuries. ETH is increasingly seen as a strategic reserve and yield-bearing asset, reshaping its narrative from utility token to digital collateral. Strong Hands, Limited Supply With Ethereum trading around $3,618, Novogratz feels ETH is “destined” to knock on the $4,000 door and possibly break into price discovery if it does. He emphasized that there’s not much ETH supply floating around, making it easier for big purchases to move the price. The consistent accumulation by companies, even those preparing to list publicly like Ether Machine, could trigger a squeeze and send prices flying. ETH Gaining Ground on Bitcoin Not only is ETH catching up in price, it’s also outperforming Bitcoin on the charts. The ETH/BTC ratio has jumped over 36% in the past month, signaling stronger momentum. While Novogratz remains bullish on Bitcoin long-term, he thinks Ethereum might lead the race shortly, especially with narratives around ETH utility and staking gaining ground. Bitcoin Still Looks Strong Despite favoring ETH in the short term, Novogratz isn’t sidelining Bitcoin. He sees $150,000 as a reasonable target for BTC , driven by continued bullish sentiment. Bitfinex analysts echoed that with a $136,000 short-term target, though they caution it could mark a temporary peak. However, Novogratz warned that if U.S. interest rate policy shifts unexpectedly, especially under a Trump-led administration, his bullish outlook might need revisiting. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin Dominance Spikes as Altcoin Season Index Crashes – Is a Sell-off Coming? , ETH $4K, Possible?

While Bitcoin remains solid, ETH could take the spotlight over the next few months. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { fl"

Bankruptcy court just greenlit $1.9B in disbursements, with payments scheduled to begin on September 30. Claimants must be verified before the August 15 record date to be eligible. This marks round three of FTX’s massive repayment plan , a multibillion-dollar effort to make users whole following the exchange’s 2022 collapse. The approved distribution brings FTX’s total repayments to $8.1B, following previous disbursements of $1.2B in February and $5B in May. The target? Between $14.7B and $16.5B in total payouts. Recoveries vary depending on the type of claim and how assets were valued during the bankruptcy. Roughly 98% of creditors are expected to receive at least 119% of the value of their original claims. That’s based on pricing from the date FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. It’s an unexpected twist in what was once viewed as a hopeless case. After FTX’s collapse, many assumed pennies on the dollar , if anything. Now, most former users stand to gain, not just recover. Who Gets Paid , and How FTX has named BitGo, Kraken, and Payoneer as the official distribution platforms. To receive payouts, users need to complete KYC checks and submit tax documents. Geopolitical restrictions apply. Users in China, Russia, Ukraine, and Pakistan may face delays or additional compliance checks. No further detail was given on how long these hold-ups might last. FTX has warned that failing to complete all necessary verifications may result in delays or forfeiture of claims.

The court’s latest approval to unlock $1.9B comes as part of the third phase in FTX’s sequential repayment strategy. While exact amounts per claimant will vary, the estate has emphasized fairness and speed in execution. What makes this case unique is the surplus most retail users are now expected to receive , a stark contrast to most crypto bankruptcies. Institutional lenders and larger creditors may receive lower recovery percentages, depending on specific assets held and contract terms. Asset Valuation: The Key Factor All payouts are based on the value of assets at the time of the bankruptcy filing , not current prices. So even if a user held Solana (SOL), Ethereum (ETH), or Bitcoin (BTC), they’ll receive fiat-equivalent based on Nov 2022 prices, not today’s market value. This clause is both a win and a loss: For many, it’s still a major recovery. But for some, especially those who held long-term assets, the upside potential has been lost. The August 15 record date is critical. Anyone without verified claims by that date will not be included in the upcoming batch of payments. FTX has not released dates for subsequent distributions, but insiders suggest a final major round could arrive by early 2026, depending on asset liquidation progress and regulatory clearance. Token Data Snapshot FTT (FTX Token) is currently trading at $1.42, with a market cap of $466M. While FTT is no longer relevant to the bankruptcy estate’s recovery, the token still attracts speculation , especially from traders anticipating a relaunch or restructuring. With over $6.2B already distributed and another $1.9B unlocked, FTX is rewriting the playbook for post-collapse recovery.

But there’s a catch,they’re always online. That convenience? It’s also exposure. Think of it like keeping your wallet on the kitchen table with the window open. Sure, it’s handy. But one slip, and someone’s in. Crypto exchanges often juggle hot wallets across multiple chains,BTC, ETH, BNB, you name it. So if one wallet is compromised, attackers can leap across networks quickly.

Here’s your crypto hygiene checklist: 1. Rotate API Keys If you’ve connected bots or tools to your exchange account, rotate those keys regularly. Keep access tight,read-only when possible. 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) This should be a no-brainer. Always use MFA. And don’t just use SMS,opt for app-based authentication or hardware keys. 3. Split Your Funds Never store your life savings in a hot wallet. Keep only what you need for active trading. Cold wallets or self-custody options like Ledger and Trezor exist for a reason.

Stay tuned to this account for updates: https://t.co/qWc9cDhn2z — WOO X (@_WOO_X) July 24, 2025 What’s the Deal With Hot Wallets? Hot wallets are essential for fast deposits, trades, and withdrawals. But there’s a catch,they’re always online. That convenience? It’s also exposure. Think of it like keeping your wallet on the kitchen table with the window open. Sure, it’s handy. But one slip, and someone’s in. Crypto exchanges often juggle hot wallets across multiple chains,BTC, ETH, BNB, you name it. So if one wallet is compromised, attackers can leap across networks quickly. Woo X Hack by the Numbers BTC: Funds traced via wrapped $BTCB ETH: Received $1M via USDT swap BNB: Converted from BTCB post-breach ARB & TRX: Included in chain activity 3 Quick Tips to Stay Safe Even if you’re not on Woo X, this is your wake-up call. Here’s your crypto hygiene checklist: 1. Rotate API Keys If you’ve connected bots or tools to your exchange account, rotate those keys regularly. Keep access tight,read-only when possible. 2. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) This should be a no-brainer. Always use MFA. And don’t just use SMS,opt for app-based authentication or hardware keys. 3. Split Your Funds Never store your life savings in a hot wallet. Keep only what you need for active trading. Cold wallets or self-custody options like Ledger and Trezor exist for a reason. This user caught some of the on-chain activity early. WOO X Security Spotlight: What Happened & How You Stay Safe Hey Crypto Fam!

2025-07-25 06:40:11+00:00,Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company’s Bold Bet on Digital Gold,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Acquisition: The Smarter Web Company’s Bold Bet on Digital Gold The digital asset landscape continues to evolve at a breathtaking pace, with Bitcoin leading the charge as a preferred treasury reserve asset for an increasing number of forward-thinking corporations. In a move that underscores growing institutional confidence in digital gold, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a prominent UK-based web development firm, recently made headlines with its latest significant Bitcoin acquisition . This strategic purchase isn’t just a fleeting headline; it represents a powerful statement about the future of corporate finance and the undeniable appeal of decentralized assets in an uncertain economic climate. Why are Companies Doubling Down on Bitcoin Acquisition? In an era marked by fluctuating global economies and persistent inflation concerns, businesses are constantly seeking innovative ways to protect and grow their capital. For many, traditional treasury strategies are no longer sufficient. This is where Bitcoin steps onto the corporate stage, offering a compelling alternative to conventional cash reserves or low-yielding bonds. The decision by companies like SWC to engage in substantial Bitcoin acquisition is driven by several key factors: Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it inherently deflationary, a stark contrast to fiat currencies susceptible to quantitative easing and devaluation. Companies view it as a robust shield against the eroding purchasing power of traditional money. Digital Gold Narrative: Often dubbed “digital gold,” Bitcoin shares properties with its physical counterpart – scarcity, divisibility, and portability – but surpasses it in ease of transfer and storage in the digital realm. It’s seen as a store of value in the 21st century. Balance Sheet Diversification: Smart financial management dictates diversification. Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury provides an uncorrelated asset, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and enhancing long-term returns. Future-Proofing Business: Companies operating in the tech sector, especially, recognize the accelerating shift towards a digital-first economy. Embracing Bitcoin isn’t just a financial play; it’s an alignment with the very technological innovations they often champion. It signals a progressive stance and a readiness to operate within the emerging Web3 landscape. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have famously adopted Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, inspiring countless others to follow suit. While MicroStrategy’s scale of Bitcoin acquisition is unparalleled, the trend is filtering down to businesses of all sizes, from tech startups to established enterprises across various industries. The Smarter Web Company’s Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition: A Closer Look The recent announcement from The Smarter Web Company (SWC) via X (formerly Twitter) sent ripples of interest across the crypto community. A UK-based web development firm, SWC’s latest purchase of an additional 225 BTC significantly bolsters its digital asset portfolio. This single transaction brings their total Bitcoin holdings to an impressive 1,825 BTC, solidifying their position as a notable corporate holder of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. For a web development company, this move is particularly insightful. SWC isn’t merely speculating on price; they are likely integrating a long-term vision where digital assets play a crucial role in their financial strategy and potentially, their service offerings. It reflects a deep understanding of the underlying technology and its potential to reshape global commerce and finance. This isn’t their first foray into crypto, but rather a continuation of a deliberate, calculated strategy. Let’s visualize the growth of SWC’s Bitcoin treasury: Date of Announcement (Approx.) Amount Purchased (BTC) Total Holdings (BTC) Early 2023 Initial Accumulation ~1,000 Mid-2023 Additional Purchases ~1,600 Recent Announcement +225 1,825 This incremental approach to Bitcoin acquisition demonstrates a prudent and consistent strategy, allowing them to average down their cost basis and mitigate the impact of market volatility.

Every major corporate Bitcoin acquisition sends a ripple through the cryptocurrency market, influencing sentiment, liquidity, and even the perception of digital assets among traditional investors. SWC’s latest move contributes to several significant trends: Validation of Bitcoin as a Legitimate Asset: Each corporate treasury adoption adds another layer of legitimacy to Bitcoin, moving it further away from speculative novelty and closer to a recognized financial asset.

The fund reached $10 billion “in one year flat,” and is the third-fastest ETF to hit that mark in history, observed Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas on Thursday. “Amazingly, it went from $5 billion to $10 billion in just ten days,” he said. He added that the top two ETFs to hit that milestone within a year are BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).

Sister Hazel! pic.twitter.com/Jrrb15BdHV — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 24, 2025 New Inflow Record for Fidelity BlackRock’s ETHA fund saw a rare zero inflow day on Thursday, but Fidelity made up for that with a $210 million inflow for its FETH fund. This was also a new inflow record for the asset manager, observed industry expert Nate Geraci. The total inflow for the day for spot Ether ETFs in the United States was $231 million, marking the fifteenth consecutive trading day in a row without an outflow. The last aggregate outflow from the nine funds was just $1.9 million on July 2. More than $3 billion has entered the funds over the past seven trading days, representing about a third of the entire inflow since they launched in July 2024. Geraci also observed on Friday that spot Ether ETFs have taken in more new capital than spot Bitcoin ETFs in each of the past six trading days, with $2.4 billion compared to $830 million in totals. It’s a “noticeable difference,” he said, adding that it is also “something to watch.” Bitwise has estimated that ETPs and corporate treasuries have combined to buy 2.8 million ETH since mid-May, around 32 times the net new supply over the same time period. ETH Holds Steady, BTC Dumps The sustained buying pressure has prevented ETH from doing its usual dump when Bitcoin retreats. In fact, ETH has remained flat on the day while BTC dumped more than 3% over the past 12 hours. Ether prices are currently at $3,630, and the asset has entered a range-bound channel over the past week.

2025-07-25 06:45:10+00:00,"Bitcoin Correction: Why This ‘Dip’ is a Golden Opportunity, Not a Crisis","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Correction: Why This ‘Dip’ is a Golden Opportunity, Not a Crisis In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, a price dip often triggers alarm bells. When Bitcoin, the undisputed king of digital assets, experiences a significant drop, the natural instinct for many is to panic. Is this the start of a bear market? Is it time to exit? However, what if the recent Bitcoin correction isn’t a sign of impending doom but rather a healthy, necessary recalibration? What if this ‘dip’ is actually a golden opportunity disguised as a setback? Recent insights from crypto analytics firm Swissblock suggest precisely that. Their analysis, shared in a post on X, argues that Bitcoin’s move below its established trading range is not indicative of capitulation – the desperate, widespread selling that marks a market bottom – but rather a strategic, rotation-led correction. This perspective offers a refreshing counter-narrative to the fear often propagated during market downturns, urging investors to look beyond the immediate price action and understand the underlying market dynamics. Decoding the Latest Bitcoin Correction : Rotation vs. Capitulation To truly grasp Swissblock’s optimistic outlook, it’s essential to understand the distinction between a ‘rotation-led correction’ and ‘capitulation.’ These terms are crucial for interpreting market sentiment and making informed investment decisions, especially during a significant Bitcoin correction . Capitulation: The Panic Button Capitulation refers to a period of intense, widespread selling driven by fear and exhaustion. Investors, having endured prolonged losses or significant drops, finally give up hope and sell their holdings at any price to avoid further pain. This often marks the final phase of a bear market, characterized by: Extreme negative sentiment and widespread FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt). High trading volumes during the sell-off, indicating many participants exiting. Often accompanied by significant liquidation events in derivatives markets. A sense of ‘giving up’ among even long-term holders. Historically, capitulation phases are brutal but often precede a market bottom and subsequent recovery. They are usually identifiable by panic selling that extends beyond rational profit-taking or rebalancing. Rotation-Led Correction: The Healthy Rebalance In contrast, a rotation-led correction is a more organic, healthy market process. It occurs when capital moves from one asset or sector to another, or when investors take profits after a significant run-up and then look for new entry points. It’s a rebalancing act, not a panic exit. Key characteristics include: Profit-taking by short-term traders and early investors. Reallocation of funds within the crypto ecosystem (e.g., from Bitcoin to altcoins, or vice-versa, or even into stablecoins temporarily). A lack of extreme fear, with underlying bullish sentiment remaining intact. Often occurs in a low-risk environment, suggesting systemic stability. Creates fresh liquidity and new entry points for patient investors. Swissblock’s assertion is that the current Bitcoin correction falls firmly into this latter category, indicating a market that is consolidating its gains rather than collapsing. The Swissblock Blueprint: Why This Bitcoin Correction Isn’t Cause for Alarm Swissblock’s analysis isn’t just a hunch; it’s backed by specific indicators that paint a picture of resilience rather than weakness. Let’s delve into the key metrics they highlighted that underscore the robust nature of the current Bitcoin correction : Is the Risk Index Signaling Danger, or Opportunity? Swissblock noted that their proprietary Risk Index stood at 0. A low Risk Index suggests that the market is not in an overheated state, where speculative activity is rampant and prices are unsustainably high. When the Risk Index is low, it implies that the market is not characterized by excessive greed or leverage. This creates a more stable foundation, making any price pullbacks less likely to cascade into a full-blown collapse. Think of it like a car engine: if it’s not redlining, a slight deceleration is just normal driving, not a breakdown. Are We Overheating? Signs of a Healthy Market Another crucial point from Swissblock was the absence of “signs of overheating.” What does this mean in practical terms for the Bitcoin correction ? Overheating in crypto markets is typically indicated by: Excessive Funding Rates: High positive funding rates in perpetual futures markets suggest traders are paying a premium to hold long positions, indicating over-optimism and potential for liquidations. High Open Interest: A rapid increase in open interest without corresponding price movement can signal a build-up of speculative positions. Euphoric Sentiment: Overly bullish sentiment across social media and mainstream news, often leading to irrational exuberance.

Meanwhile, 24-hour trading volume has spiked by 9.15%, a sign of turbulence rather than growth. From Bitcoin’s stumble below $116k to widespread liquidations across altcoins, today’s decline is driven by a combination of over-leveraged bets, profit-taking, and capital flight from riskier assets. What Happened? Long Squeeze Triggers Chain Reaction Bitcoin’s drop below $116k shattered its major short-term support, triggering a massive $585M in long liquidations within 24 hours. ETH followed closely, losing $104M in longs, while altcoins like Dogecoin (-7%) and PAAL AI (-4.8%) were among the worst performers. The average funding rate across exchanges (+0.008%) indicates excessive bullish leverage, now being punished. The domino effect pushed BTC liquidations up by 123%, forcing automated sell-offs and creating further downward pressure. Why Now? Profit-Taking After a 30-Day Rally After a 16% gain over the last month, which was mainly driven by ETF optimism and retail FOMO, many traders are now cashing in. The 21-day RSI climbed to 74.25 (overbought territory), while MACD showed bearish divergence (-3.68B), hinting at trend exhaustion. Stablecoin inflows surged $11B in July, a signal that investors are temporarily parking funds in safer assets. Altcoins Face Added Pressure Rotation into Safety Altcoins are bearing the brunt as Bitcoin dominance rises to 60.8%. Illiquid and speculative tokens, such as memecoins, tanked sharply due to post-hype sell-offs and thin order books. Uncertainty around the GENIUS Act’s stablecoin regulations is further driving caution, reducing trader appetite for high-beta bets. Conclusion Today’s dip is less about panic and more about profit-taking, exaggerated by a high-leverage market setup. With the Fear & Greed Index still at a greed-driven score of 66, sentiment remains optimistic, but fragile. If BTC can defend $115k ahead of Friday’s U.S. PCE inflation data, we could see fresh buying emerge. However, a deeper macro sell-off or further liquidations may flip the sentiment decisively bearish. FAQs What triggered the market drop today?

This allows the sellers and the buyers to use cryptocurrency without involving banks. The new unit, led by Christie’s Southern California CEO Aaron Kirman, manages over $1 billion in crypto-listed properties. This is open to buyers paying in crypto only. Christie’s Offers $1 billion Luxury Crypto-Listed Properties The unit led by Kirman is now planning to expand the crypto real estate models, which previously involved the sale of a $65 million Beverly Hills mansion. The move aligns with regulatory developments of the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). In June, it directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to explore treating crypto as a reserve asset in risk assessment for mortgages. Properties currently listed for bitcoin include — $118 million La Fin mansion in Bel Air, the $18 million Invisible House in Joshua Tree, and $63 million Nightingale property in Beverly Hills. Proper Security Check to Ensure Protection in Crypto Transaction The estate network has a legal and crypto compliance team of lawyers, analysts, and crypto experts to ensure the security of the crypto transactions during trading. The section will run complete legal checks on the origin of the assets to ensure their legality. Kirman said that these wealthy crypto asset holders seeking real-world assets prefer to avoid traditional banking systems, keeping their identities protected. So, these blockchain-based asset transactions will make it harder for the public to trace the ownership. Christie’s Follows the Global Trend of Crypto As the U.S. pushes forward the evolution of digital assets with the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act, global businesses, even real estate networks, adopt the trend. In an interview , Kirman said, “The trend was obvious — crypto is here to stay…it’s only going to get bigger over the next few years.” Kirman estimates that in five years, over one-third of US home sales could involve cryptocurrency.

While bearish signals threaten the much-awaited altcoin season, VINE exploded from $0.03770 to $0.07945 within minutes. That led to an approximately 110% on its daily chart.

The latest rejection, which took place hours ago, was particularly painful as it drove BTC south to its lowest price tag since July 11 at $115,000. This violent correction appears to be at least partially related to Galaxy Digital’s decision to dump a substantial portion of its BTC stash.

2025-07-25 07:15:49+00:00,Monthly BTC and ETH options are expiring today,"The monthly options expiry on Deribit added to the market volatility, as BTC moved down to the $115,000 range. While smaller than June’s expiry event, the market is still liquid and may affect spot prices. The options expiry on Deribit may add to the price pressure for BTC. The leading coin traded at $115,549.15, pressured closer to the level of maximum pain at $112,000. Deribit announced a total of $15.45B in options, down from June’s $17B. The monthly event is still considered significant, as the crypto market has not experienced a summer slump. The BTC options expiring have a notional value of $12.66B, while ETH expects a $2.75B expiry event. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 Tomorrow, over $15.4B in BTC and ETH options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $12.66B notional | Put/Call: 0.88 | Max Pain: $112K $ETH : $2.75B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $2,800 Last month’s H1 expiry hit $17B. This week’s is not far… pic.twitter.com/5nFSk7qDPg — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 24, 2025 While ETH maximum pain price at $2,800 is less probable, BTC may see last-minute pressure. For the past few months, both BTC and ETH have expired above their options maximum pain price. The put/call ratio signals a more moderate stance, though still retaining a bullish trend. Deribit has seen a faster accumulation of open interest, already building up over $37B for the quarter to date. At the end of Q2, the open interest at expiry was just $35B. BTC still trades in greed territory, with an index of 67. However, this does not preclude short-term price moves. Overall BTC volatility is near an all-time low, though the price still fluctuates between key levels. The BTC volatility index is down to 1.27%, with a brief spike during the July rally. BTC expects dip on extended long liquidations BTC may easily dip to the $114,000 range, where an accumulation of short positions may trigger an attack. Despite this, BTC retains its bullish factors, with a new accumulation of short positions all the way to $119,000 . Despite the complex trading, the end of the month has historically performed as a good entry point. BTC still expects a breakout to a new price range, despite temporary setbacks. ETH retains the $3,600 range, though the token saw the largest share of long liquidations in the past 24 hours. ETH is traded with more exuberance, with signs of being overheated. The market dominance of ETH expanded to 11.4% as more traders switched their attention, while BTC dominance sank to 59.6%. BTC and ETH had a drawdown mostly driven by long liquidations, ahead of the monthly options expiry. | Source: CoingGlass. In the past 24 hours, ETH was a leader of liquidations, with $152.13M in predominantly long positions. BTC saw $152.04 in long positions liquidated. BTC falls on signs of whale selling BTC also faces added pressure from spot selling. Despite the general accumulation trend, in the short term some whales are sending their coins to exchanges. Galaxy Digital, one of the intermediaries for both retail and institutional traders, has sent 11,910 BTC to multiple exchanges. 🚨 Is a BIG #BITCOIN SELL-OFF taking place? Over the past 9 hours, #GalaxyDigital deposited 11,910 $BTC ($1.39B) to multiple exchanges. These BTCs likely originated from the Bitcoin OG that offloaded 80,202 $BTC ($9.54B) at an average of $118,950 between July 15–18.

The spot sales originating from the Galaxy Digital wallet follows a recent reawakening of a wallet from 2011. The wallet moved 3,962 BTC, after making a test transaction. The old whale wallet received the typical messages of proving coin ownership, which have made other whales move their coins to new addresses and split them to avoid easy tracking.

While smaller than June’s expiry event, the market is still liquid and may affect spot prices. The options expiry on Deribit may add to the price pressure for BTC. The leading coin traded at $115,549.15, pressured closer to the level of maximum pain at $112,000. Deribit announced a total of $15.45B in options, down from June’s $17B. The monthly event is still considered significant, as the crypto market has not experienced a summer slump. The BTC options expiring have a notional value of $12.66B, while ETH expects a $2.75B expiry event. 🚨 Options Expiry Alert 🚨 Tomorrow, over $15.4B in BTC and ETH options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $12.66B notional | Put/Call: 0.88 | Max Pain: $112K $ETH : $2.75B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $2,800 Last month’s H1 expiry hit $17B. This week’s is not far… pic.twitter.com/5nFSk7qDPg — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 24, 2025 While ETH maximum pain price at $2,800 is less probable, BTC may see last-minute pressure. For the past few months, both BTC and ETH have expired above their options maximum pain price. The put/call ratio signals a more moderate stance, though still retaining a bullish trend. Deribit has seen a faster accumulation of open interest, already building up over $37B for the quarter to date. At the end of Q2, the open interest at expiry was just $35B. BTC still trades in greed territory, with an index of 67. However, this does not preclude short-term price moves. Overall BTC volatility is near an all-time low, though the price still fluctuates between key levels. The BTC volatility index is down to 1.27%, with a brief spike during the July rally. BTC expects dip on extended long liquidations BTC may easily dip to the $114,000 range, where an accumulation of short positions may trigger an attack. Despite this, BTC retains its bullish factors, with a new accumulation of short positions all the way to $119,000 . Despite the complex trading, the end of the month has historically performed as a good entry point. BTC still expects a breakout to a new price range, despite temporary setbacks. ETH retains the $3,600 range, though the token saw the largest share of long liquidations in the past 24 hours. ETH is traded with more exuberance, with signs of being overheated. The market dominance of ETH expanded to 11.4% as more traders switched their attention, while BTC dominance sank to 59.6%. BTC and ETH had a drawdown mostly driven by long liquidations, ahead of the monthly options expiry. | Source: CoingGlass. In the past 24 hours, ETH was a leader of liquidations, with $152.13M in predominantly long positions. BTC saw $152.04 in long positions liquidated. BTC falls on signs of whale selling BTC also faces added pressure from spot selling. Despite the general accumulation trend, in the short term some whales are sending their coins to exchanges. Galaxy Digital, one of the intermediaries for both retail and institutional traders, has sent 11,910 BTC to multiple exchanges. 🚨 Is a BIG #BITCOIN SELL-OFF taking place? Over the past 9 hours, #GalaxyDigital deposited 11,910 $BTC ($1.39B) to multiple exchanges. These BTCs likely originated from the Bitcoin OG that offloaded 80,202 $BTC ($9.54B) at an average of $118,950 between July 15–18. Notably,… https://t.co/8wySKm7Eai pic.twitter.com/Qy8t4xqTiI — Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) July 25, 2025 The crypto service provider also kept sending a few hundred BTC to Bybit and Bitstamp. The spot sales originating from the Galaxy Digital wallet follows a recent reawakening of a wallet from 2011. The wallet moved 3,962 BTC, after making a test transaction. The old whale wallet received the typical messages of proving coin ownership, which have made other whales move their coins to new addresses and split them to avoid easy tracking.

Covered in the thread pic.twitter.com/xS1odcdYbF — CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 24, 2025 The trading landscape is shifting. Data from the past week shows Ethereum edging ahead of Bitcoin in spot volume, suggesting rising investor interest and market activity in ETH. While Ethereum’s price surged over 26% in the same period, supported by six consecutive green candles, Bitcoin dipped by 1.55%. This could point to a growing confidence in Ethereum’s ecosystem and a potential shift in market leadership at least temporarily. Ethereum ETF Inflows Gain Momentum ETF flows further strengthen Ethereum’s momentum. Between July 14 and 18, spot Ethereum ETFs saw inflows of over $2.18 billion, and since July 21, an additional $1.39 billion has poured in. In just one day, the market saw a fresh $231.2 million inflow. Meanwhile, Bitcoin ETFs started strong with $2.37 billion in inflows between July 14 and 18, but have since faced outflows exceeding $285 million between July 21 and 23. The mixed flows raise questions about shifting investor preferences. Derivatives Market: High Interest, Rising Liquidations On July 22, Ethereum open interest reached a new all-time high of $28 billion. However, within 24 hours, around $150 million in ETH positions were liquidated, with over $111 million being long bets. This signals some short-term caution as Ethereum’s price dropped 3.87% from its recent peak of $3,860. Ethereum Exchange Reserves Are Shrinking Another bullish indicator? ETH is leaving exchanges. Data from CryptoQuant shows that Ethereum reserves across centralized exchanges have fallen by 3.46% since the start of the month, from over 20 million to roughly 19.32 million ETH. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why the Crypto Market is Down Today: BTC, ETH, XRP Lead the Drop? , This decline usually suggests that holders are moving their ETH into cold storage, confident about the asset’s long-term prospects and less inclined to sell.

Subsequent movements flagged by analysts at CryptoQuant lifted the 10-day tally to about 57 million XRP, taking dollar outflows past the $200 million mark at Thursday’s average price. The transfers landed while XRP was retreating from last week’s local peak of $3.66. On Thursday, the token had slipped to an intraday low near $2.95, before stabilising above $3.000. Although correlation is not causation, critics seized on the timing. On-chain analyst JA Maartun told his followers that Larsen “just dumped ≈ $200 M worth of XRP in the past 10 days… You’re the exit liquidity. Think twice.” Blockchain forensics firm Lookonchain, corroborating ZachXBT’s figures , estimates that wallets attributed to Larsen still control about 2.81 billion XRP. In a reply on X, ZachXBT confirmed that “wallets linked to Chris Larsen only have another 2.81 B+ XRP ($8.4 B) left,” signalling that even after the recent sell-down Larsen remains one of the market’s single largest potential sources of supply. The Original Ripple “Founders Reward” Court filings in the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s 2020 enforcement action against Ripple describe the initial allocation with rare precision. When the XRP Ledger was finalised in December 2012, its fixed supply of 100 billion tokens was divided so that 80 billion went to Ripple and 20 billion to the three founders “as compensation.” Nine billion XRP went to Larsen and nine billion to fellow co-founder Jed McCaleb; two billion went to early engineer Arthur Britto. Brad Garlinghouse, Ripple’s current chief executive but not a founder, never received a “founders reward.” Instead, Ripple’s board granted him 500 million XRP as part of his elevation to CEO on 13 December 2016 and a further 250 million on 29 May 2019. By the time the SEC filed its complaint, 521 million of those tokens had been delivered, valued then at about $246 million. A December 2024 Forbes deep-dive put Larsen’s fortune at $9.2 billion, noting that “roughly half is still denominated in XRP.” Jed McCaleb , who finished liquidating his “Tacostand” wallets in 2022, is listed at $2.9 billion in the April 2025 Forbes Billionaires ranking. Arthur Britto’s wealth is notoriously opaque—he eschews publicity—but if he retained his full two-billion-token grant it would be worth about $6.2 billion at current prices.

2025-07-25 07:31:47+00:00,Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction for July 25,"The Bitcoin price today is trading near $115,600 after a sharp intraday decline that pierced below the lower boundary of the descending channel on the 4-hour chart. This move also broke through the key ascending trendline support that had held since early July, raising concerns of a potential trend shift as momentum stalls. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price action had been coiling inside a descending parallel channel since mid-July. The recent breakdown below $116,000 suggests the bears are attempting to seize control after multiple failed bullish attempts near the $118,800 to $119,200 resistance area. Price has now deviated below the lower bound of the channel and closed under the dotted ascending trendline that previously supported every major bounce this month.

The Bitcoin price today is trading near $115,600 after a sharp intraday decline that pierced below the lower boundary of the descending channel on the 4-hour chart. This move also broke through the key ascending trendline support that had held since early July, raising concerns of a potential trend shift as momentum stalls. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin price action had been coiling inside a descending parallel channel since mid-July. The recent breakdown below $116,000 suggests the bears are attempting to seize control after multiple failed bullish attempts near the $118,800 to $119,200 resistance area. Price has now deviated below the lower bound of the channel and closed under the dotted ascending trendline that previously supported every major bounce this month. This breakdown appears significant, especially given the rejection from the midline of the channel earlier this week and the sharp bearish engulfing candle printed after that. If the daily close confirms below $115,300, sellers may push price into deeper liquidity pockets toward $113,000 or lower.

According to Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas, the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) now holds over $10 billion in assets , reaching that milestone in just 251 days. Only BlackRock’s own IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC spot Bitcoin ETFs got there faster. What’s remarkable is that half of ETHA’s current assets— $5 billion—came in within just 10 days , a surge Balchunas compared to a “God candle,” a term for rapid, explosive price movement. ETHA is now consistently among the top 5 ETFs for net inflows , both weekly and monthly, signaling a strong shift in investor interest from Bitcoin to Ethereum. ETH’s performance supports this trend. The asset has gained over 50% in the past week and more than doubled since mid-May. At the same time, Bitcoin’s 30-day gain sits at just 24%.

He says Bitcoin is stuck inside a Rising Wedge pattern and believes that BTC could soon drop below $100,000 if signs play out. So, is a big drop coming? Bitcoin Whales Selling BTC Recently, Bitcoin’s price fell from its key support level of $118,000 and is now trading around $115,710, down about 1.9% for the day. One of the big reasons for this drop is that whales are once again shaking the market. Meanwhile, Galaxy Digital reportedly sold 10,000 BTC worth about $1.18 billion and also withdrew $370 million USDT from exchanges. This large sell-off pushed Bitcoin down by 3% in just one hour and caused around $144 million in liquidations , mostly long positions. When big holders sell during thin trading days, prices can slide fast. Key Level to Watch: $113,000 According to Captain Faibik, Bitcoin must stay above $113,000 to avoid a bigger drop. If it closes below this level, the price could break down quickly. Many traders watch this level closely because it shows if the buying strength is still strong or getting weaker. $BTC is on the verge of breaking down from its Rising Wedge..!!

2025-07-25 07:55:09+00:00,Galaxy Digital Withdrawal: Unveiling Crucial Moves Amidst Bitcoin’s Sell-Off,"BitcoinWorld Galaxy Digital Withdrawal: Unveiling Crucial Moves Amidst Bitcoin’s Sell-Off The cryptocurrency market is a dynamic landscape, often characterized by rapid shifts and intriguing maneuvers by major players. Recently, the crypto world has been abuzz with news surrounding a significant Galaxy Digital withdrawal . This event, involving hundreds of millions in USDT, has naturally sparked intense discussion and speculation, especially as it unfolds against the backdrop of a continued Bitcoin (BTC) sell-off. What exactly does this move signify for the market, and what can we learn from the actions of institutional giants like Galaxy Digital? What Triggered This Crucial Galaxy Digital Withdrawal? Earlier in the day, the crypto financial firm Galaxy Digital made headlines for depositing a substantial amount of Bitcoin to various centralized exchanges. This action alone often raises eyebrows, as large deposits to exchanges can sometimes precede selling activity, increasing supply and potentially downward pressure on prices. However, the plot thickened significantly just hours later. According to diligent on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X , Galaxy Digital proceeded to withdraw a staggering $456 million in USDT (Tether) from three major exchanges: Binance, Bybit, and OKX, all within a tight 30-minute window. This rapid sequence of events – depositing BTC and then withdrawing a massive sum of stablecoin – is not merely coincidental. It suggests a deliberate, strategic play by a sophisticated institutional entity. For context, Galaxy Digital currently holds a significant 18,504 BTC, valued at approximately $2.13 billion. This substantial holding underscores their deep involvement in the Bitcoin ecosystem, making their every move a subject of intense scrutiny. The Galaxy Digital withdrawal of such a large USDT sum immediately raises questions about their intentions: Is it a preparation for future investments, a rebalancing of their portfolio, or something else entirely? Decoding Galaxy Digital’s Strategy: Is This a Bitcoin Sell-Off Signal? When a major player like Galaxy Digital makes a move of this magnitude, it rarely happens without strategic intent. The Galaxy Digital withdrawal of $456 million in USDT, especially after depositing BTC, could be interpreted in several ways, each with different implications for the ongoing Bitcoin sell-off: Preparing for Dip Buying: One common strategy during a sell-off is to accumulate stablecoins to be ready to buy assets at lower prices. By withdrawing USDT, Galaxy Digital might be positioning itself to acquire more BTC or other cryptocurrencies if prices continue to drop, viewing the current downturn as a buying opportunity. Operational Liquidity: Large firms require substantial liquidity for various operations, including investments, partnerships, or even covering short-term liabilities. The USDT withdrawal could simply be a move to consolidate funds for immediate use outside of exchange trading, rather than a direct market signal. Hedging or Risk Management: In volatile markets, firms often engage in hedging strategies to protect their existing holdings. While less common to withdraw stablecoins for this, it could be part of a broader, complex financial maneuver to mitigate risk associated with their Bitcoin exposure. Market Sentiment Signal: Regardless of their direct intent, such a large Galaxy Digital withdrawal inherently sends a signal. Some might interpret it as a lack of immediate confidence in the market’s upward trajectory, prompting them to hold stable assets rather than volatile ones. However, it’s crucial not to jump to conclusions based on a single data point. Understanding the full picture requires looking beyond just this one transaction and considering Galaxy Digital’s overall financial health and market outlook. The Broader Bitcoin Sell-Off: What’s Driving the Market Downturn? The Galaxy Digital withdrawal takes place within a broader context of a sustained Bitcoin sell-off. While specific institutional actions contribute to market sentiment, several macroeconomic and industry-specific factors are typically at play during such downturns: Key Drivers of the Current Bitcoin Sell-Off: Macroeconomic Headwinds: Global economic uncertainties, including persistent inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions, often lead investors to pull out of riskier assets like cryptocurrencies and seek safer havens. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent global cryptocurrency regulations continues to be a significant concern for institutional investors. Ambiguity can deter new capital inflows and encourage existing players to de-risk. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant price appreciation, some long-term holders and miners might decide to take profits, leading to increased selling pressure.

2025-07-25 08:10:10+00:00,Bitcoin Futures: Unveiling the Ominous Downward Pressure and Hidden Opportunity,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Futures: Unveiling the Ominous Downward Pressure and Hidden Opportunity The world of cryptocurrency is a fascinating tapestry of innovation, volatility, and unexpected turns. For those deeply immersed in this digital frontier, understanding market signals is paramount. Recently, the spotlight has been on the Bitcoin futures market, which has presented some intriguing, albeit concerning, data points that demand our attention. What exactly is happening, and what could it mean for the price of Bitcoin? Understanding the Alarming Dip in Bitcoin Futures Net Position In the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency trading, futures contracts play a pivotal role, allowing traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. A crucial metric within this space is ‘Open Interest’ (OI), which represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. When we talk about the ‘OI net position,’ we are looking at the difference between long and short positions, providing insight into the overall market sentiment. Recently, a notable update from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a significant shift: the open interest (OI) net position in the Bitcoin futures market has plummeted below $100 million. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; Adler Jr. specifically pointed out that this marks the strongest downward pressure observed since early July. To put this into perspective: What is OI Net Position? It indicates whether the market is net long (more buyers expecting price increases) or net short (more sellers expecting price decreases). A negative net position suggests a dominance of short positions. Significance of $100 Million: Dipping below this threshold, especially after a period of relative stability, signals a strong bearish sentiment among futures traders. Historical Context: Comparing it to early July provides a historical benchmark, indicating that the current bearish pressure is not typical and warrants close observation. This decline suggests that a substantial number of traders are betting against Bitcoin’s immediate price action, potentially leading to continued selling pressure. However, the market rarely moves in a straight line, and these extreme conditions can sometimes pave the way for surprising reversals. Decoding Downward Pressure in the Bitcoin Futures Market: Why is BTC Resilient? When analysts speak of ‘downward pressure,’ they are referring to a situation where there is a strong inclination for an asset’s price to fall. This is typically driven by a surplus of sellers over buyers, or in the case of futures, a preponderance of short positions. For Bitcoin, this means that despite fundamental interest, the sentiment in the derivatives market is heavily skewed towards a decline. Given such pronounced bearish signals from Bitcoin futures , one might expect BTC’s spot price to be plummeting. Yet, as Axel Adler Jr. also noted, Bitcoin has remarkably continued to circle around the $115,000 mark. This apparent resilience in the face of strong bearish futures data begs the question: why isn’t BTC collapsing? The answer, according to the analyst, lies in the actions of spot market participants: buyers are absorbing some of the selling volume. This indicates a fascinating divergence: Market Segment Observed Behavior Implication Bitcoin Futures Market Strong net short positions, downward pressure. Traders are betting on lower prices. Bitcoin Spot Market Price holding steady around $115,000. Real demand is absorbing selling pressure. This absorption suggests that despite the bearish sentiment in the derivatives market, there’s underlying demand for Bitcoin, perhaps from long-term holders, institutional investors, or retail buyers who see the current levels as an attractive entry point. This dynamic creates a tense standoff, where the market is primed for a significant move once one side gains a decisive advantage. The Enigmatic Short Squeeze: A Potential Catalyst for Bitcoin Futures ? While the immediate outlook might seem bearish due to the overwhelming short positions in Bitcoin futures , this very extremity can become a powerful catalyst for a sharp upward reversal. This phenomenon is known as a ‘short squeeze.’ So, what exactly is it, and how could it impact Bitcoin? A short squeeze occurs when a heavily shorted asset suddenly rises in price, forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions. Here’s a breakdown: The Setup: A large number of traders open short positions, betting that an asset’s price will fall. The Trigger: The asset’s price begins to rise, even slightly, perhaps due to unexpected positive news, a sudden surge in buying interest, or simply reaching a support level. The Squeeze: As the price rises, short sellers face increasing losses. To limit these losses, they are forced to ‘cover’ their positions by buying back the asset. The Spiral: This forced buying further pushes t",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-futures-pressure-opportunity/,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,Crypto News|$BTC|BITCOIN|CryptoQuant|Futures market|Market Analysis,BTC,"Bitcoin Futures: Unveiling the Ominous Downward Pressure and Hidden Opportunity.

Understanding the Alarming Dip in Bitcoin Futures Net Position In the dynamic realm of cryptocurrency trading, futures contracts play a pivotal role, allowing traders to speculate on the future price of an asset without owning the underlying asset itself. A crucial metric within this space is ‘Open Interest’ (OI), which represents the total number of outstanding derivative contracts that have not yet been settled. When we talk about the ‘OI net position,’ we are looking at the difference between long and short positions, providing insight into the overall market sentiment. Recently, a notable update from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. on X highlighted a significant shift: the open interest (OI) net position in the Bitcoin futures market has plummeted below $100 million. This isn’t just a minor fluctuation; Adler Jr. specifically pointed out that this marks the strongest downward pressure observed since early July. To put this into perspective: What is OI Net Position? It indicates whether the market is net long (more buyers expecting price increases) or net short (more sellers expecting price decreases). A negative net position suggests a dominance of short positions. Significance of $100 Million: Dipping below this threshold, especially after a period of relative stability, signals a strong bearish sentiment among futures traders. Historical Context: Comparing it to early July provides a historical benchmark, indicating that the current bearish pressure is not typical and warrants close observation. This decline suggests that a substantial number of traders are betting against Bitcoin’s immediate price action, potentially leading to continued selling pressure. However, the market rarely moves in a straight line, and these extreme conditions can sometimes pave the way for surprising reversals. Decoding Downward Pressure in the Bitcoin Futures Market: Why is BTC Resilient? When analysts speak of ‘downward pressure,’ they are referring to a situation where there is a strong inclination for an asset’s price to fall. This is typically driven by a surplus of sellers over buyers, or in the case of futures, a preponderance of short positions. For Bitcoin, this means that despite fundamental interest, the sentiment in the derivatives market is heavily skewed towards a decline. Given such pronounced bearish signals from Bitcoin futures , one might expect BTC’s spot price to be plummeting. Yet, as Axel Adler Jr. also noted, Bitcoin has remarkably continued to circle around the $115,000 mark. This apparent resilience in the face of strong bearish futures data begs the question: why isn’t BTC collapsing? The answer, according to the analyst, lies in the actions of spot market participants: buyers are absorbing some of the selling volume. This indicates a fascinating divergence: Market Segment Observed Behavior Implication Bitcoin Futures Market Strong net short positions, downward pressure. Traders are betting on lower prices. Bitcoin Spot Market Price holding steady around $115,000. Real demand is absorbing selling pressure. This absorption suggests that despite the bearish sentiment in the derivatives market, there’s underlying demand for Bitcoin, perhaps from long-term holders, institutional investors, or retail buyers who see the current levels as an attractive entry point. This dynamic creates a tense standoff, where the market is primed for a significant move once one side gains a decisive advantage. The Enigmatic Short Squeeze: A Potential Catalyst for Bitcoin Futures ? While the immediate outlook might seem bearish due to the overwhelming short positions in Bitcoin futures , this very extremity can become a powerful catalyst for a sharp upward reversal. This phenomenon is known as a ‘short squeeze.’ So, what exactly is it, and how could it impact Bitcoin? A short squeeze occurs when a heavily shorted asset suddenly rises in price, forcing short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions. Here’s a breakdown: The Setup: A large number of traders open short positions, betting that an asset’s price will fall. The Trigger: The asset’s price begins to rise, even slightly, perhaps due to unexpected positive news, a sudden surge in buying interest, or simply reaching a support level. The Squeeze: As the price rises, short sellers face increasing losses. To limit these losses, they are forced to ‘cover’ their positions by buying back the asset. The Spiral: This forced buying further pushes t"
2025-07-25 08:15:10+00:00,Bitcoin Volatility: Decoding Normal Market Swings,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Volatility: Decoding Normal Market Swings Are you feeling the jitters from recent Bitcoin price movements? If so, you’re not alone. The world of cryptocurrency, especially when it comes to Bitcoin volatility , can often feel like a rollercoaster ride. However, a recent insight from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. offers a reassuring perspective: what we’ve been witnessing is well within the typical range of Bitcoin’s historical price fluctuations. Understanding this can be key to navigating the crypto markets with greater confidence. Understanding Bitcoin Volatility: Is This Normal? When the price of Bitcoin dips, it’s natural for investors, especially newcomers, to feel a sense of alarm. However, seasoned analysts often look at these movements through a broader lens. Axel Adler Jr.’s analysis, shared on X, highlights that recent Bitcoin price adjustments are not outliers but rather align with the cryptocurrency’s established patterns of Bitcoin volatility . Let’s break down what this means: Historical Context: Over the past quarter, Bitcoin has experienced five-minute timeframe drops as steep as -10% and -12%. These rapid, sharp declines are part of its inherent market behavior. Average Weekly Drawdowns: The average weekly drawdown for Bitcoin stands at approximately 3.8%. This figure represents the typical percentage decrease from a peak within a week. Current Pullback Analysis: The recent -6% pullback, while visually striking on charts, is only about 2.2% deeper than this average. When compared to historical extremes, it’s far from unprecedented. This suggests that the current phase is likely a consolidation, a period where the market digests recent gains before potentially moving higher. It’s a natural rhythm in any asset’s price discovery, but amplified by Bitcoin’s unique market dynamics. Why Does Bitcoin Volatility Happen? The inherent Bitcoin volatility stems from a confluence of factors unique to the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional assets, Bitcoin operates 24/7, is highly speculative, and is influenced by a diverse range of global events and sentiments. Understanding these drivers can help investors differentiate between normal market fluctuations and more significant shifts. Key drivers include: Factor Explanation Market Maturity Despite its growing adoption, the crypto market is still relatively young compared to traditional finance. This leads to less liquidity and greater price swings from large buy/sell orders. Regulatory News Government announcements, bans, or approvals related to cryptocurrencies can trigger significant market reactions. Macroeconomic Factors Inflation data, interest rate changes, and global economic stability can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. Technological Developments Upgrades to the Bitcoin network, or significant developments in competing blockchain technologies, can impact sentiment. Social Media Sentiment The influence of prominent figures or viral trends on platforms like X can quickly shift market mood and drive speculative trading. How Do Experts Analyze Bitcoin Volatility? Analysts like Axel Adler Jr. from CryptoQuant utilize a range of sophisticated tools and metrics to assess Bitcoin volatility . Their work involves more than just looking at price charts; it’s about delving into on-chain data, derivatives markets, and broader macroeconomic indicators to form a holistic view. Here are some methods and concepts they employ: On-Chain Metrics: Tracking transactions, wallet activity, miner behavior, and exchange flows provides insights into the fundamental supply and demand dynamics. For instance, a large influx of Bitcoin to exchanges might signal selling pressure. Volatility Indicators: Tools like the Average True Range (ATR) or Bollinger Bands help measure the degree of price fluctuation over time, indicating whether current swings are typical or extreme. Derivatives Market Analysis: Examining futures and options markets can reveal institutional sentiment and expected future price movements. High open interest in perpetual futures, for example, can sometimes precede liquidations that amplify price swings. Historical Comparison: Placing current price movements into the context of Bitcoin’s entire history is crucial. Bitcoin has seen numerous cycles of sharp rises followed by significant pullbacks, only to reach new highs later. This rigorous approach helps distinguish between noise and genuine signals, providing a clearer picture of Bitcoin’s true market health. Navigating Bitcoin Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors Understanding that Bitcoin volatility is a normal characteristic doesn’t mean you should ignore price movements. Instead, it empowers you to react strategically rather than emotionally. Here are some actionable insights to help you navigate these dynamic markets: Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Bitcoin’s history shows a clear upward trend despite numerous significant corrections.

While price charts and technical indicators offer valuable insights, a deeper dive into trader positioning can reveal underlying biases that often precede significant market moves. One such powerful, yet frequently overlooked, indicator is the BTC long-short ratios for perpetual futures. These ratios provide a direct snapshot of how traders are positioning themselves on derivatives exchanges, indicating whether the collective sentiment leans bullish (long) or bearish (short). For anyone looking to navigate Bitcoin’s volatile landscape with greater precision, grasping the implications of these ratios is not just an advantage, it’s a necessity. What Do BTC Long-Short Ratios Really Tell Us? At its core, a long-short ratio is a simple yet profound metric. It represents the proportion of traders holding ‘long’ positions (betting on a price increase) versus those holding ‘short’ positions (betting on a price decrease) on a given cryptocurrency perpetual futures contract. When you see the BTC long-short ratios , you’re essentially getting a pulse check on the market’s immediate expectations for Bitcoin. A ratio above 1 typically indicates a predominance of long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment. Conversely, a ratio below 1, or more specifically, a higher percentage of short positions as seen in our recent data, points towards a bearish outlook. For instance, let’s examine the 24-hour data for BTC perpetual futures across leading exchanges: Category Long Percentage Short Percentage Total Market 48.16% 51.84% Binance 47.88% 52.12% Bybit 47.39% 52.61% Gate.io 46.18% 53.82% As the table clearly illustrates, over the past 24 hours, the aggregate market for BTC perpetual futures has shown a slight bearish bias, with short positions outweighing long positions. This trend is consistently reflected across major exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Gate.io, indicating a widespread sentiment rather than an isolated anomaly. Why Are BTC Long-Short Ratios a Crucial Indicator for Astute Traders? Understanding BTC long-short ratios goes beyond just knowing who’s betting what. It offers several critical advantages for traders seeking an edge: Gauging Market Sentiment: This is the most direct benefit. The ratios provide an immediate understanding of whether the crowd is leaning bullish or bearish. This insight is invaluable for confirming your own analysis or identifying potential contrarian opportunities. If everyone is overwhelmingly long, it might signal an overcrowded trade susceptible to a correction. Identifying Potential Reversals: Sometimes, extreme long-short ratios can act as contrarian indicators. If the market is overwhelmingly short, for example, it might be ripe for a ‘short squeeze’ where price rises rapidly, forcing short sellers to buy back their positions and fueling further upward momentum. Conversely, an excessively long market can be vulnerable to a ‘long squeeze’ or significant correction. Complementing Other Indicators: While powerful, BTC long-short ratios are best used in conjunction with other technical and fundamental analysis tools. They can confirm trends identified by price action, volume, or on-chain data, adding an extra layer of conviction to your trading decisions. Assessing Market Crowdedness: A highly skewed ratio indicates a crowded trade. Entering a trade where the majority is already positioned can be risky, as it leaves less room for further movement in that direction and increases the likelihood of a sharp reversal if sentiment shifts. By integrating this data into your analysis, you move beyond just looking at price and volume, gaining a deeper understanding of the collective psychological state of the market participants. How Do Exchange-Specific BTC Long-Short Ratios Offer Unique Insights? While the overall market BTC long-short ratios provide a general overview, looking at individual exchanges offers a more nuanced perspective. As seen in our data: Binance: Long 47.88%, Short 52.12% Bybit: Long 47.39%, Short 52.61% Gate.io: Long 46.18%, Short 53.82% Notice that all three top exchanges exhibit a similar bearish leaning over the 24-hour period, with short positions slightly outnumbering long positions. However, there are subtle differences. Gate.io, for instance, shows a slightly more pronounced bearish bias compared to Binance or Bybit. These variations can be attributed to several factors: User Demographics: Different exchanges attract different types of traders.

The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic shifts, has once again captured headlines with a notable dip. According to Bitcoin World market monitoring , the Bitcoin price has recently fallen below the critical $115,000 mark, trading at $114,974.81 on the Binance USDT market. This development has naturally sparked discussions among investors, traders, and enthusiasts alike, prompting a closer look at what this means for the broader crypto landscape and what might be next for the flagship digital asset. Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Movement When the Bitcoin price experiences a significant drop, it’s rarely due to a single factor. The crypto market is influenced by a complex interplay of macroeconomic trends, regulatory news, technological advancements, and shifts in investor sentiment. While the immediate news highlights the drop below $115,000, it’s essential to consider the broader context: Market Volatility: Bitcoin has a well-documented history of high volatility. Price swings of 10-20% in a short period are not uncommon, making it a high-risk, high-reward asset. Liquidation Events: Large price movements often trigger cascading liquidations in the derivatives market, where traders using leverage are forced to close their positions, further amplifying the price drop. Global Economic Factors: Broader economic concerns, such as inflation rates, interest rate hikes by central banks, and geopolitical tensions, can lead investors to de-risk their portfolios, pulling funds from more speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. This recent movement serves as a potent reminder of the unpredictable nature of the crypto market and the importance of staying informed. What Factors Influence the Bitcoin Price ? Understanding the forces that shape the Bitcoin price is crucial for any participant in the crypto space. While the exact cause of any single dip can be elusive, several overarching factors consistently play a role: Macroeconomic Climate: A Hidden Hand? The global economic environment significantly impacts investor behavior. When traditional markets face uncertainty or recession fears loom, investors often flock to safe-haven assets, or conversely, pull capital from riskier ventures like crypto. High inflation rates, central bank policies (like quantitative tightening), and shifts in global liquidity can directly affect the demand for and thus the Bitcoin price . Regulatory Developments: Friend or Foe? News of new regulations, bans, or even positive legislative frameworks can cause immediate and strong reactions in the market. Uncertainty surrounding regulatory clarity often leads to investor apprehension, which can suppress the Bitcoin price . Conversely, clear, supportive regulations can pave the way for broader institutional adoption, potentially boosting prices. Market Sentiment and News Cycles: The Emotional Rollercoaster Cryptocurrency markets are highly susceptible to sentiment. Positive news (e.g., major institutional adoption, technological upgrades, successful project launches) can fuel rallies, while negative news (e.g., exchange hacks, major project failures, FUD – Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) can trigger sell-offs. Social media trends and influential figures also play a significant role in shaping public perception and, consequently, the Bitcoin price . Technical Analysis and On-Chain Metrics: Decoding the Charts Many traders rely on technical analysis, studying historical price charts and patterns to predict future movements. Key support and resistance levels, moving averages, and trading volumes are closely watched. On-chain metrics, which analyze data directly from the Bitcoin blockchain (e.g., active addresses, transaction volume, miner behavior), also provide insights into the network’s health and potential price trends. Is This a Buying Opportunity or a Warning Sign? For many seasoned crypto investors, a dip in the Bitcoin price is often viewed as a potential buying opportunity, famously known as ‘buying the dip.’ However, it’s crucial to approach such situations with a clear strategy and a strong understanding of your risk tolerance. Considerations for Investors: Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Are you investing for quick gains or are you a long-term holder (HODLer) who believes in Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition over years?

2025-07-25 08:40:11+00:00,Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Remarkable Surge as Public Companies Accumulate Bitcoin,"BitcoinWorld Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: A Remarkable Surge as Public Companies Accumulate Bitcoin The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving, and one of the most compelling narratives emerging is the increasing embrace of Bitcoin by established corporations. What was once considered a niche or speculative asset is rapidly transitioning into a legitimate component of corporate treasury strategies. This seismic shift is highlighted by a remarkable statistic shared by Chris Kuiper, VP of Research at Fidelity Digital Assets: the number of public companies holding at least 1,000 Bitcoin (BTC) has surged to 35 so far in Q3. This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it represents a growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition and its role in the future of finance. The growing trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption signals a significant maturation of the digital asset market. Why Are Public Companies Embracing Institutional Bitcoin Adoption ? The decision for a public company to allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin is not made lightly. It involves extensive due diligence, risk assessment, and a clear strategic vision. Several factors are driving this wave of institutional Bitcoin adoption : Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation concerns, traditional fiat currencies are losing purchasing power. Bitcoin, with its capped supply of 21 million coins, is increasingly viewed as a digital store of value, akin to digital gold, capable of preserving wealth against inflationary pressures. Digital Gold Narrative: Bitcoin’s scarcity, immutability, and decentralized nature position it as a robust alternative to traditional safe-haven assets. Companies are recognizing its potential to serve as a long-term reserve asset that is resistant to censorship and government interference. Portfolio Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can offer diversification benefits, as its price movements often show a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns. Long-Term Value Proposition: Beyond short-term price fluctuations, many corporations are looking at Bitcoin through a long-term lens, anticipating its continued growth and integration into the global financial system. They see it as an innovative asset that aligns with future economic trends. Signaling Innovation: For some companies, holding Bitcoin is also a strategic move to signal their forward-thinking approach and embrace of technological innovation. This can resonate with tech-savvy investors and customers, enhancing brand image and attracting new talent. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have openly championed Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, setting a precedent for others. Other notable early adopters include Tesla and Block Inc. (formerly Square), demonstrating varied approaches to integrating Bitcoin into their financial frameworks. Tracing the Trajectory: The Remarkable Growth of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption The data shared by Chris Kuiper of Fidelity Digital Assets paints a clear picture of accelerating interest. His insights, shared via X (formerly Twitter), provide a quarterly snapshot of this burgeoning trend: Time Period Number of Public Companies Holding ≥1,000 BTC End of Q1 24 End of Q2 30 So far in Q3 35 This consistent quarter-over-quarter increase from 24 to 30 and now to 35 companies signifies more than just a passing interest. It indicates a strategic and deliberate shift in how major corporations view and manage their capital. Each of these 35 companies has committed to holding a substantial amount of Bitcoin, demonstrating a belief in its enduring value. The threshold of 1,000 BTC, currently valued in the tens of millions of dollars depending on market price, represents a significant treasury allocation, underscoring the seriousness of this growing institutional Bitcoin adoption trend. What Are the Benefits of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption for Corporations? Beyond the general motivations, the practical benefits for companies engaging in institutional Bitcoin adoption are compelling: Enhanced Treasury Management: In a low-interest-rate environment, traditional cash holdings often yield negligible returns and are susceptible to inflation. Bitcoin offers an alternative asset that has historically shown significant appreciation potential, providing a more dynamic approach to treasury management. Attracting a New Investor Base: Companies that embrace Bitcoin can appeal to a growing demographic of crypto-aware investors. This can broaden their shareholder base and potentially lead to increased stock valuations, as investors seek exposure to companies with forward-thinking financial strategies.

Investors are seeking to find tokens with practical utility, real adoption potential, and favorable entry points. Ozak AI is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about names in analyst circles. Ozak AI (OZ)—The AI-Powered Token Gaining Ground Fast Ozak AI is a blockchain project that is built on AI crypto trading and portfolio management tools. It provides real-time market analysis based on intelligent agents that have learned to produce predictive signals using live data. Ozak AI has an infrastructure that is built on speed and scale. It combines with blockchain layers to provide secure and cost-effective processing. Ozak AI is already equipped with a functional system, and the security of the platform has already been audited, unlike many other projects at the initial stage. Ozak is on presale stage 4, and the tokens cost $0.005. In the next round, this price will be doubled to $0.01. It has already raised over $1.42 million, with more than 44 million tokens sold. The functionality of smart contracts has been implemented, and the token claims will start after the presale. Liquidity is locked for 12 months, and token vesting is structured to release gradually over six months. The mega giveaway of $1 million has so far spread its magic to captivate investors. Ethereum (ETH) — Smart Contract Dominance Continues Current price: $3,627.02 Market cap: $437.82B Ethereum is the most popular smart contract network. The widely known upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 will possibly boost the scalability and help in reducing the transaction cost. With additional projects being launched on Ethereum and the increase in demand for decentralized applications, ETH is continuing to gain an advantage. Binance Coin (BNB) — Utility in the World’s Largest Exchange Current price: $763.12 Market cap: $106.29B BNB plays a very crucial role in the trading ecosystem of Binance. It supports everything from transaction fee discounts to token launches and DeFi tools. Its deep integration in both centralized and decentralized platforms keeps demand stable. As crypto trading activity rises, so does the relevance of BNB in the wider ecosystem. Solana (SOL) — Fast, Developer-Friendly, and Building Momentum Current price: $184.63 Market cap: $99.35B Solana offers one of the fastest transaction speeds in the space and has seen a steady rise in developer activity. With expanding use in NFTs, gaming, and DeFi, Solana has positioned itself as a high-performance blockchain. The post-Bitcoin rally environment favors networks like Solana that can handle real-world demand efficiently. Polygon (MATIC) — Scaling Ethereum’s Reach Current price: $0.2268 Market cap: $2.37B Polygon provides a scalable layer-2 solution to Ethereum’s congestion problems. It’s widely adopted by developers looking for fast and affordable deployment of decentralized apps. As Ethereum’s usage grows, Polygon often sees parallel gains, making it a key project to watch during periods of market expansion. Conclusion Bitcoin pushing over $120K is not only a milestone but also a sign that altcoin season is approaching. Although Ethereum, Binance Coin, Solana, and Polygon have had steady development, Ozak AI is unique in its utility-focused strategy and has successfully conducted presales.

2025-07-25 08:53:46+00:00,Expert Reveals Why He Aggressively Bought the XRP Dip Yesterday,"When XRP dropped sharply from above $3.50 to $2.99 on July 23, many investors panicked. However, crypto strategist and investor Armando Pantoja did not, but saw it as an opportunity. In a video posted after the drop, Pantoja explained why he bought the dip, citing Ripple’s expanding role in the banking sector and the long-term value he sees in XRP. According to Pantoja, this isn’t just about a temporary price swing. With Ripple applying for a U.S. national banking license , he said, the company is moving into a new phase. “Ripple isn’t just partnering with banks anymore, it’s becoming one.” In his view, this changes the outlook for XRP entirely. This one reason made me aggressively buy the $XRP dip yesterday pic.twitter.com/HhNYaoHKEn — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) July 24, 2025 A Structural Shift in Global Payments Pantoja believes XRP is positioned to solve a major inefficiency in the global financial system.

When XRP dropped sharply from above $3.50 to $2.99 on July 23, many investors panicked. However, crypto strategist and investor Armando Pantoja did not, but saw it as an opportunity. In a video posted after the drop, Pantoja explained why he bought the dip, citing Ripple’s expanding role in the banking sector and the long-term value he sees in XRP. According to Pantoja, this isn’t just about a temporary price swing. With Ripple applying for a U.S. national banking license , he said, the company is moving into a new phase. “Ripple isn’t just partnering with banks anymore, it’s becoming one.” In his view, this changes the outlook for XRP entirely.

Amid this heavy selling the $BTC price has fallen as low as $115,000. Could Bitcoin collapse to $112,000, or is a bounce finally about to arrive? $BTC price forms bull flag Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC illustrates how close to the brink the price is right now. The triangle pattern that was previously being drawn for the price action has now been updated to a flag, which after this latest price drop, fits the $BTC movements well over the last several days. It now remains to be seen whether the bulls can hold the line, or whether the bears can force the price out of the bottom of the flag and confirm below. If the bears do win this struggle, a drop to $112,000 could happen very quickly. Heavy selling from OG whale According to the Lookonchain X account, posts tell that 10K $BTC, probably from an OG whale, has recently been sold, and since then, another 2,850 $BTC has been transferred to exchanges. This particular source of selling is ongoing. So to sum up, one of two scenarios are about to happen. The first scenario is that the price does collapse out of the flag, and a rapid descent to $112,000 ensues. The other scenario is that the bulls are able to defend the bottom of the flag, and that this becomes the point from which a strong bounce can take place. It should be borne in mind that the bull market is continuing, the trend is up, and even if the price does fall back, this could just be a small hiccup on the way. Measured move out of bull flag to $130,000 Source: TradingView The daily time frame shows how the bull flag has now taken shape. If the price does hold where it is now, and then starts to retrace towards the top of the bull flag, a measured move is displayed in the chart above with the dashed red arrows. The height of the pole is taken from the breakout of the previous big bull flag to the top of the current small one. This is then transferred to the bottom point of the flag. The height of the pole corresponds pretty much exactly to $130,000. Could this be the next target? At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are now very close to the bottom. The next day or two could see them angle back to the upside. This current correction is likely drawing to a close. $BTC price about to become more parabolic? Source: TradingView The weekly chart, with a curve drawn in, displays how the price is now leaving the curve and is potentially becoming more parabolic. This does make sense if Bitcoin is indeed entering the final phase of its bull run. Having said that, once $130,000 is reached, perhaps another bigger continuation pattern will force the price sideways and down for an extended period, which could see the price make contact with the curve again. The problem of making these kinds of future guesses is that it is not known whether this particular bull market will be the typical 4-year cycle we have been used to seeing so far, or whether it will be an extended cycle, given the huge influx of institutional money entering the market. What should be known soon is if the Stochastic RSI indicators on the weekly time frame will cross back up, or whether they will bounce from the 80.00 level and then cross back up.

2025-07-25 08:59:55+00:00,Bitcoin Selloff Alert: Galaxy Digital Triggers Panic With $9.5B BTC Moves,"The post Bitcoin Selloff Alert: Galaxy Digital Triggers Panic With $9.5B BTC Moves appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Today, Bitcoin is bleeding around $115,500–$116,000 , down about 2–3%. The broader crypto market also saw the bloodbath, with total market capitalization falling nearly 5–7% in the past 24 hours. This pullback follows a near-record rally, suggesting profit-taking is in full swing. Bitcoin is back under pressure after Galaxy Digital, a major crypto investment firm, moved billions to various exchanges over the past 9 hours. BTC Selloff Triggered? BITCOIN is approaching $115K, a level not seen in the past 2 weeks. Galaxy Digital has reportedly offloaded over $2B worth of Bitcoin to centralized exchanges in just the last 8 hours. This is not a dip… it is a test of conviction. Will bulls take… pic.twitter.com/nEU6RWe9f7 — Wise Advice (@wiseadvicesumit) July 25, 2025 These large transfers have sparked fresh concerns of a possible sell-off, especially as BTC dipped nearly 2% in the same 24-hour period. Why is Bitcoin down Today? Spot On Chain flagged a major Bitcoin transfer by Galaxy Digital, which deposited 11,910 BTC (worth $1.39 billion) to several exchanges in just 9 hours. These funds appear to come from a “Bitcoin OG” wallet that offloaded 80,202 BTC, over $9.5 billion, between July 15 and 18 at an average price of $118,950. Earlier, on July 15, Galaxy had already sent 2,000 BTC ($236M) to Binance and Bybit. This sudden activity has raised fears of a large-scale sell-off, coinciding with a ~2% dip in BTC price over the last 24 hours. While these transfers don’t automatically mean Galaxy is selling, the scale and timing have raised eyebrows, especially with Bitcoin showing weakness just above $115K, its lowest level in weeks. Market Challenging the Long Positions? As this news broke, the futures market saw over $700 million in long position liquidations. This suggests traders were caught off guard, triggering a “long squeeze” where forced selling accelerates price drops. Some believe this pressure is temporary, but it’s clear the market is feeling uneasy. At the same time, on-chain trackers and analysts are closely watching exchange flows. Many traders fear that such big transfers could eventually lead to more selling, adding to the short-term volatility. Sentiment Still Holds in the Long Term Despite the recent dip, broader sentiment hasn’t turned fully bearish. Institutional interest remains strong, especially with Bitcoin ETFs still seeing steady inflows. While short-term fear has crept in, most analysts agree this doesn’t change Bitcoin’s longer-term trend. Crypto analyst known as T suggests that while institutions may be taking profits near the $115K level, it’s not a sign of weakness. He reminds followers that Bitcoin is still up 500% since ETF approvals, and movements like Galaxy Digital’s recent transfers are likely just routine portfolio rebalancing. He also compares it to MicroStrategy’s early BTC sales, which didn’t stop Bitcoin’s long-term rise. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

2025-07-25 09:00:00+00:00,ETH on Track to Hit $4K And Beat Bitcoin: Galaxy Digital CEO,"Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz sees ETH breaking $4,000 soon, with other analysts projecting even higher targets. Ethereum ETFs also recently outpaced Bitcoin ETFs in inflows for six consecutive days, led by BlackRock’s ETHA and Fidelity’s FETH. Additionally, on-chain data shows lower ETH selling pressure, while technical levels suggest $4,500 as a key resistance point. With ETH outperforming BTC by over 36% in the past month, Ethereum could continue leading the market in the coming months. Ethereum Set to Outperform Bitcoin Institutional interest in Ethereum (ETH) is accelerating at a remarkable pace, and Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz believes it could propel ETH to outperform Bitcoin (BTC) over the next three to six months. Speaking to CNBC , Novogratz pointed to a tightening ETH supply and strong market momentum, and suggested that a breakout past $4,000 could lead Ethereum into a phase of price discovery. With Ethereum currently hovering around $3,641, that target reflects a modest 8+% climb. Novogratz firmly believes that it''s well within reach, saying, “We feel kind of destined to at least knock on the $4,000 ceiling a few times.” ETH price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Backing Novogratz’s optimism are major corporate purchases of ETH. BitMine Immersion Technologies recently disclosed holdings of 566,776 ETH valued at roughly $2.03 billion, while Sharplink Gaming reported 360,807 ETH worth around $1.29 billion. Another firm, Ether Machine, is preparing to list on Nasdaq under the ticker “ETHM,” with more than 400,000 ETH — about $1.5 billion — under management at launch. At the same time, Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin has surged by over 36% in the past 30 days, according to TradingView data. Despite this, Novogratz is also bullish on Bitcoin, and suggested that a $150,000 price point is achievable as long as macroeconomic conditions remain favorable. He did warn, however, that a shift in US monetary policy sentiment, especially if President Donald Trump reverses his stance on rate cuts, could alter the bullish trajectory. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes took an even more optimistic stance on Ethereum by projecting a potential rally to $10,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, analysts at Bitfinex have pegged $136,000 as the next key upside target for Bitcoin, but warned that such levels typically coincide with market euphoria and could mark a temporary top. Overall, the narrative surrounding Ethereum is gaining steam, fueled by strategic accumulation from institutional players and a compelling macro backdrop. While both Ethereum and Bitcoin are poised for potential gains, ETH’s tightening supply and growing adoption may give it the upper hand over the coming months. ETH ETFs Dominate The surge in institutional interest in Ethereum became even more evident after spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted more capital than their Bitcoin counterparts over the past six trading days. According to data from Farside Investors , Ethereum ETFs recorded close to $2.4 billion in net inflows during this period, overshadowing the $827 million seen by spot Bitcoin ETFs. Interestingly, Ethereum ETFs outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows for each of the six days. Ethereum ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) stepped up as the dominant player, pulling in $1.79 billion. This is about 75% of the total inflows. ETHA also recently achieved a major milestone by becoming the third-fastest ETF to reach $10 billion in assets under management, doing so in just 251 trading days. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) set a new single-day inflow record on Thursday, receiving $210 million. This allowed it to surpass its previous high from December of 2024. Market analysts from Swissblock Research anticipate this momentum to continue in Ethereum’s favor, and suggested that ETH is beginning to take the lead as the crypto cycle enters its next phase. ETH Gathers Even More Strength Ethereum continues to show signs of strength relative to Bitcoin, with on-chain data also suggesting that ETH faces lower selling pressure compared to BTC. According to CryptoQuant , the ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio is still far from historically high levels, indicating fewer ETH tokens are being moved to exchanges and suggesting reduced sell-side activity. This trend supports the potential for continued ETH outperformance. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ETF holding ratio climbed from 0.02 in May to 0.12. This could mean that there is growing investor preference for Ethereum exposure over Bitcoin. ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio. (Source: CryptoQuant ) Glassnode’s cost basis model pointed out some key price levels to monitor for Ether. On the downside, support lies between $2,000 and $3,000, with specific levels at $2,100, $2,500, and $3,000.

BitMine Immersion Technologies recently disclosed holdings of 566,776 ETH valued at roughly $2.03 billion, while Sharplink Gaming reported 360,807 ETH worth around $1.29 billion. Another firm, Ether Machine, is preparing to list on Nasdaq under the ticker “ETHM,” with more than 400,000 ETH — about $1.5 billion — under management at launch. At the same time, Ethereum’s performance relative to Bitcoin has surged by over 36% in the past 30 days, according to TradingView data. Despite this, Novogratz is also bullish on Bitcoin, and suggested that a $150,000 price point is achievable as long as macroeconomic conditions remain favorable. He did warn, however, that a shift in US monetary policy sentiment, especially if President Donald Trump reverses his stance on rate cuts, could alter the bullish trajectory. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes took an even more optimistic stance on Ethereum by projecting a potential rally to $10,000 by the end of the year. Meanwhile, analysts at Bitfinex have pegged $136,000 as the next key upside target for Bitcoin, but warned that such levels typically coincide with market euphoria and could mark a temporary top. Overall, the narrative surrounding Ethereum is gaining steam, fueled by strategic accumulation from institutional players and a compelling macro backdrop. While both Ethereum and Bitcoin are poised for potential gains, ETH’s tightening supply and growing adoption may give it the upper hand over the coming months. ETH ETFs Dominate The surge in institutional interest in Ethereum became even more evident after spot Ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) attracted more capital than their Bitcoin counterparts over the past six trading days. According to data from Farside Investors , Ethereum ETFs recorded close to $2.4 billion in net inflows during this period, overshadowing the $827 million seen by spot Bitcoin ETFs. Interestingly, Ethereum ETFs outperformed Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows for each of the six days. Ethereum ETF flows (Source: Farside Investors ) BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA) stepped up as the dominant player, pulling in $1.79 billion. This is about 75% of the total inflows. ETHA also recently achieved a major milestone by becoming the third-fastest ETF to reach $10 billion in assets under management, doing so in just 251 trading days. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) set a new single-day inflow record on Thursday, receiving $210 million. This allowed it to surpass its previous high from December of 2024. Market analysts from Swissblock Research anticipate this momentum to continue in Ethereum’s favor, and suggested that ETH is beginning to take the lead as the crypto cycle enters its next phase. ETH Gathers Even More Strength Ethereum continues to show signs of strength relative to Bitcoin, with on-chain data also suggesting that ETH faces lower selling pressure compared to BTC. According to CryptoQuant , the ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio is still far from historically high levels, indicating fewer ETH tokens are being moved to exchanges and suggesting reduced sell-side activity. This trend supports the potential for continued ETH outperformance. Additionally, the ETH/BTC ETF holding ratio climbed from 0.02 in May to 0.12. This could mean that there is growing investor preference for Ethereum exposure over Bitcoin. ETH/BTC exchange inflows ratio. (Source: CryptoQuant ) Glassnode’s cost basis model pointed out some key price levels to monitor for Ether. On the downside, support lies between $2,000 and $3,000, with specific levels at $2,100, $2,500, and $3,000. These reflect the realized price, true market mean, and active realized price respectively, offering strong suppor"

In the new improvement document published on the development hosting platform GitHub, Solana developers say that the SIMD-0286 proposal will increase the network’s per-block compute limit from 60 million compute units (CU) to 100 million CU. Compute units serve as resources needed for every transaction on the Solana network. The amount of CU spent varies depending on the complexity of the operation. The developers unveiled the SIMD-0286 proposal in the wake of the network’s recent upgrade. SIMD-0256, which was activated earlier this week, increased the block ceiling from the previous 50 million CU to 60 million CU. “The intention is for this to follow SIMD-0256 (as opposed to replacing). SIMD-0256 is a much more modest increase in block space. This proposal aims to increase block space more aggressively.” The proposal to increase the limit to 100 million CU will further boost the network’s block capacity by over 65% albeit the developers say the improvement may cause unforeseen issues in infrastructure beyond the validators. “Block limits’ primary purpose is to ensure the vast majority of network participants are able to keep up with the network… This proposal aims for a substantial increase in block limits to 100M CUs, in order to provide additional capacity to the network.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don''t Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The benchmark cryptocurrency slipped from an intraday peak above $119,000 late Thursday to trade as low as $115,800 in European morning hours, its weakest print in a fortnight. The 2.7 percentage-point slide followed an unmistakable on-chain signal: Galaxy Digital quietly pushed more than 10,000 BTC—worth about $1.18 billion at the time—onto major exchanges in less than eight hours, according to wallet-tracking firm Lookonchain. Galaxy Digital Triggers Bitcoin Slide “Bitcoin sell-off still underway! Galaxy Digital deposited another 2,850 BTC ($330.44M) to exchanges,” Lookonchain warned on X in the early European morning hours, noting that the transfer originated from a Satoshi-era whale that re-awakened this month. Prior to that, the analytics account posted an alert: “Note that Galaxy Digital has deposited over 10,000 BTC ($1.18B) to exchanges in the past 8 hours!” Screenshots of Arkham Intelligence dashboards showed a series of multi-million-dollar transactions converging on Binance, Bybit and OKX.

2025-07-25 09:55:11+00:00,STX Token: Crucial Bithumb Suspension Announced for Stacks Network Upgrade,"BitcoinWorld STX Token: Crucial Bithumb Suspension Announced for Stacks Network Upgrade The dynamic world of cryptocurrency is constantly evolving, with continuous updates and enhancements shaping the digital asset landscape. For investors and enthusiasts, staying informed about these developments is not just beneficial, but absolutely essential. A significant announcement from South Korean crypto exchange Bithumb has recently captured the attention of the STX token community, signaling an important, albeit temporary, change in how users can interact with their holdings. This move underscores the ongoing commitment to improving blockchain infrastructure and ensuring a robust, secure environment for digital assets. Why is Bithumb Suspending STX Token Transactions? Bithumb, a prominent player in the South Korean crypto exchange arena, has officially announced a temporary halt to deposits and withdrawals of the STX token . This suspension is scheduled to commence at 03:00 UTC on July 29. The primary reason behind this measure is to provide full support for the upcoming Stacks network upgrade. Network upgrades are fundamental to the health and evolution of any blockchain. They are designed to introduce new features, enhance security protocols, improve scalability, and fix any existing bugs, ultimately making the network more efficient and reliable. For exchanges like Bithumb, suspending transactions during such critical periods is a standard and necessary practice to: Ensure Data Integrity: It prevents any potential loss or corruption of user funds and transaction data during the upgrade process. Prevent Transaction Issues: Transactions initiated during an upgrade might not be processed correctly or could lead to unforeseen complications. Facilitate Smooth Transition: It allows the exchange to seamlessly adapt its systems to the new network specifications without disruption to user assets. This proactive step by Bithumb highlights their commitment to safeguarding user assets and ensuring a smooth transition for the STX token on their platform. Understanding the Stacks Network and the Role of STX Token To fully grasp the significance of this suspension, it’s important to understand what the Stacks network is and the integral role the STX token plays within it. Stacks is a unique Layer-1 blockchain that aims to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) to Bitcoin, without modifying Bitcoin itself. It extends Bitcoin’s security and stability to a broader range of functionalities, effectively unlocking Bitcoin as a programmable base layer for Web3. The STX token is the native cryptocurrency of the Stacks network. It serves multiple crucial purposes: Transaction Fees: Users pay transaction fees on the Stacks network using STX. Stacking: STX holders can ‘Stack’ their tokens to earn Bitcoin (BTC) rewards, participating in the network’s consensus mechanism (Proof of Transfer). Governance: STX holders can participate in the governance of the Stacks ecosystem, voting on proposals that shape the network’s future. The upcoming network upgrade is poised to enhance these functionalities, potentially leading to a more robust, efficient, and feature-rich Stacks ecosystem, which in turn could positively impact the utility and demand for the STX token . Crucial Steps for STX Token Holders: What You Need to Do For anyone holding or planning to transact with STX token on Bithumb, immediate action is advised. The suspension will take effect promptly at 03:00 UTC on July 29. To avoid any inconvenience or potential issues, users are strongly encouraged to: Complete All Transactions: Ensure all necessary deposits and withdrawals of STX token are finalized well before the specified deadline. Any transactions initiated after this time may not be processed and could potentially be lost or delayed indefinitely until services resume. Monitor Official Announcements: Keep a close watch on Bithumb’s official website and communication channels for updates regarding the resumption of STX token deposit and withdrawal services. The duration of the suspension will depend on the successful completion and verification of the Stacks network upgrade. Consider Alternative Storage: If you plan to hold your STX token for an extended period and wish to maintain full control during the suspension, consider withdrawing your tokens to a private, self-custody wallet that supports the Stacks network. Proactive management of your assets during such periods is a hallmark of a responsible crypto investor. By taking these steps, you can ensure your STX token holdings remain secure and accessible when services are restored. The Broader Impact of Network Upgrades on STX Token and Beyond Network upgrades, while sometimes requiring temporary service suspensions, are vital for the long-term health and competitiveness of any blockchain. For the STX token and the Stacks network, this upgrade signifies a commitment to innovation and improvement.

2025-07-25 09:56:06+00:00,From Caution to Control: Ghana to Regulate Crypto by September 2025,"Ghana will begin licensing crypto platforms by September 2025 as it shifts from caution to regulation to better manage economic data, financial stability, and surging digital asset use. Ghana to License Crypto Exchanges by 2025 Ghana is set to officially license and regulate cryptocurrency platforms by September 2025, marking a major policy shift in response to growing public adoption of digital assets. The move aligns Ghana with regional counterparts such as Nigeria and South Africa, which have already introduced crypto regulatory frameworks. Leading the initiative is the Bank of Ghana (BoG), which recently published an exposure draft outlining proposed rules for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs). These include licensing terms, anti-money laundering safeguards, and consumer protection guidelines. A draft bill, the Virtual Asset Providers Act, is currently under review and will be submitted to parliament by September. Once enacted, it will provide legal backing to the regulatory framework and allow authorities to formalise oversight of the crypto sector. Crypto Adoption Pushes Policy Shift The BoG''s pivot follows a sharp rise in digital asset adoption across Ghana. According to Web3 Africa Group CEO Del Titus Bawuah, an estimated 3 million Ghanaians, about 17% of the adult population, actively use cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT. Crypto usage has expanded beyond investment, with citizens relying on it for remittances, payments, and business operations. Bawuah noted that between July 2023 and June 2024, crypto transactions in the country reached $3 billion, reflecting its integration into daily economic activity. BoG Governor Johnson Asiama claimed that they were actually “late in the game”, highlighting that unregulated crypto activity has distorted national financial records. Many transactions involving crypto go unreported, limiting the central bank’s ability to monitor capital flows and economic trends. Stabilising the Cedi Through Regulation One of the central motivations behind the regulatory move is the BoG’s effort to stabilise the volatile Ghanaian cedi. The currency appreciated 48% over the past year, rebounding from a 25% decline the year before. Such fluctuations complicate monetary policy in a country heavily dependent on imports. Governor Asiama stated that regulating crypto platforms would help the central bank collect accurate financial data, forecast inflation trends, and gain insight into cross-border capital movements. Improved oversight is also expected to support the BoG’s broader goals of economic inclusion and long-term monetary stability. With inflation at 13.7% as of June and a benchmark interest rate of 28%, the BoG views digital asset regulation as a tool to refine its monetary strategy and attract foreign investment in fintech infrastructure.

2025-07-25 10:00:11+00:00,Galaxy Digital Bitcoin Movement: Unveiling the Mystery Behind a Massive $428M BTC Transfer,"BitcoinWorld Galaxy Digital Bitcoin Movement: Unveiling the Mystery Behind a Massive $428M BTC Transfer In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, where every on-chain move can send ripples across the market, institutional activity often captures the most attention. Recently, a significant Galaxy Digital Bitcoin movement has sparked widespread discussion and curiosity among investors and analysts alike. What exactly happened, and what could it mean for the broader crypto landscape? What Just Happened? The Galaxy Digital Bitcoin Movement Unpacked Earlier today, prominent crypto financial services firm Galaxy Digital made a notable on-chain transfer that caught the eye of analysts and investors alike. According to insights from the astute on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa , Galaxy Digital transferred a staggering 3,715 Bitcoin (BTC), equivalent to approximately $428 million at the time of the transaction, to a dozen newly created addresses. This massive transfer occurred within a mere 20-minute window, highlighting the speed and efficiency of blockchain transactions. The Scale: 3,715 BTC, valued at roughly $428 million. The Destination: 12 newly created, previously unknown addresses. The Source: Galaxy Digital, a major player in the institutional crypto space. The Mystery: The ownership of these new addresses remains undisclosed, and no further activity has been detected from them since the transfer. It’s important to note that despite this substantial outflow, Galaxy Digital still maintains a considerable Bitcoin holding on-chain. The firm reportedly retains 18,504 BTC, which is valued at approximately $2.13 billion, underscoring its continued significant presence in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Why Do Large BTC Transfers Matter to the Market? Large Bitcoin transfers, especially from known institutional entities or so-called “whale” addresses, are closely monitored for several reasons. These movements can often be precursors to significant market events or shifts in institutional strategy. Here’s why they draw so much attention: Potential Market Impact: A large transfer to an exchange could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and putting downward pressure on prices. Conversely, a transfer from an exchange to a private wallet might indicate accumulation or long-term holding. Institutional Confidence: When major players like Galaxy Digital move substantial amounts of crypto, it can reflect their confidence (or lack thereof) in the current market conditions or their future plans for the asset. Liquidity and Distribution: Such transfers can indicate how liquidity is being managed across different platforms or how assets are being redistributed within an institution’s portfolio. Security Concerns: In some cases, large, unexpected transfers can raise questions about security breaches, though this is less common with reputable firms like Galaxy Digital. In this specific instance, the transfer to new, unknown addresses rather than directly to an exchange adds a layer of intrigue, suggesting a different motive than immediate selling. Understanding On-Chain Analysis and Its Role The information about Galaxy Digital’s movement comes from “on-chain analysis,” a powerful tool in the crypto world. But what exactly is it? On-chain analysis involves examining the publicly available data on a blockchain ledger. Because cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin operate on transparent ledgers, every transaction—from sender to receiver, amount, and timestamp—is recorded and accessible to anyone. Analysts use sophisticated tools and techniques to interpret this raw data, identifying patterns, tracking large movements, and sometimes even inferring the identities or intentions behind certain addresses. Key aspects of on-chain analysis include: Address Tracking: Following the flow of funds between different wallet addresses. Transaction Volume: Monitoring the total amount of cryptocurrency being moved. Exchange Flows: Observing inflows and outflows to and from centralized exchanges. Whale Watching: Specifically tracking the movements of large holders (whales) who can significantly influence market dynamics. This method provides a unique, data-driven perspective on market activity that traditional financial markets often lack, allowing for real-time insights into the behavior of major participants. Who is Galaxy Digital ? A Quick Look To fully appreciate the significance of this Galaxy Digital Bitcoin movement , it’s helpful to understand who Galaxy Digital is. Founded by Mike Novogratz, a former hedge fund manager at Fortress Investment Group, Galaxy Digital is a diversified financial services and investment management company focused on the digital asset, cryptocurrency, and blockchain technology sectors.

2025-07-25 10:05:10+00:00,Urgent Bitcoin Miners’ $429M Deposit Sparks Market Concerns,"BitcoinWorld Urgent Bitcoin Miners’ $429M Deposit Sparks Market Concerns The cryptocurrency world recently buzzed with an urgent alert: Bitcoin miners have deposited a staggering 3,726.55 BTC, valued at approximately $429.68 million, onto various exchanges. This massive influx, reported by CryptoQuant Alert, immediately raised eyebrows across the market. What does such a substantial movement from these key network participants signify? Is it a precursor to a price correction, or merely a routine operational adjustment? Understanding the motivations behind these large Bitcoin miners’ deposits is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What Exactly Happened with Bitcoin Miners’ Deposits? On a recent day, the crypto community was notified of a significant on-chain event: Bitcoin miners transferred a substantial amount of their mined Bitcoin holdings to centralized exchanges. Specifically, CryptoQuant Alert, a well-known on-chain analytics platform, flagged a deposit of 3,726.55 BTC, equating to nearly $430 million. This isn’t just a casual transfer; it’s a movement of funds from wallets typically controlled by mining operations directly into exchange hot wallets, where assets are readily available for trading or selling. Such a large-scale transfer often indicates an intent to sell, or at the very least, a preparation for increased liquidity. For context, miners are the backbone of the Bitcoin network. They dedicate immense computational power to verify transactions and secure the blockchain, earning newly minted Bitcoin as a reward. Their behavior, therefore, serves as a unique barometer for the network’s health and potential market shifts. When Bitcoin miners move significant portions of their holdings to exchanges, it’s akin to a major institutional investor preparing to offload shares – it catches the attention of the entire market due to the potential for increased selling pressure. Why Do Bitcoin Miners Move Such Large Amounts of BTC? Unpacking the Motives The decision by Bitcoin miners to deposit such a substantial sum onto exchanges isn’t made lightly. Several factors typically drive these large transfers: Operational Costs: Mining Bitcoin is an energy-intensive business. Miners face significant recurring expenses, including electricity bills, hardware maintenance, and staff salaries. Selling a portion of their mined BTC is often necessary to cover these ongoing operational costs, especially in periods of lower profitability or rising energy prices. Profit-Taking: After periods of significant price rallies, miners might choose to realize profits. If Bitcoin’s price has surged, depositing BTC to exchanges allows them to convert their digital assets into fiat currency or other stable assets, securing their gains and improving their balance sheets. This is a common business practice in any industry. Market Sentiment and Hedging: Miners are sophisticated market participants. If they anticipate a potential market downturn or a significant price correction, they might move BTC to exchanges to hedge their positions or to sell before prices drop further. This proactive measure aims to mitigate potential losses. Hardware Upgrades and Expansion: The mining industry is highly competitive and requires constant technological advancement. Miners frequently need to invest in newer, more efficient mining rigs. Large deposits can signal an intention to liquidate assets to fund these capital-intensive upgrades or expand their mining operations. Consolidation and Liquidity Management: Sometimes, deposits might simply be part of a larger strategy to consolidate funds from various mining pools or individual operations into a central exchange account for easier management, or to increase liquidity for future strategic moves. Historical Context: Do Bitcoin Miners’ Deposits Always Signal a Downturn? The immediate reaction to large Bitcoin miners’ deposits is often one of concern, but historical data suggests the relationship isn’t always straightforward. While increased miner outflows to exchanges can certainly precede periods of price weakness due to increased selling pressure, it’s not a guaranteed one-to-one correlation. For instance, during strong bull markets, miners might sell to cover costs while demand easily absorbs the supply, leading to continued price appreciation. Conversely, in bear markets, even small miner sells can exacerbate downward trends. Consider the periods after Bitcoin halving events. Miners’ revenue per block is cut in half, often forcing less efficient miners to sell more of their holdings to stay afloat or even capitulate. This can lead to increased supply on exchanges. However, the market typically prices in halving events, and often, a subsequent bull run absorbs this selling pressure over time. It’s crucial to look beyond a single data point and analyze it within the broader market context, including overall demand, macroeconomic factors, and investor sentiment.

Here’s Why the BTC Price is Down Today & Here’s Where it May Reach! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin has entered a sharp corrective phase, shedding over 2.5% in the past 24 hours amid intense selling pressure and heightened volatility. The downturn follows a significant liquidation event triggered by large institutional offloading, with prices slipping below critical short-term levels. As July nears its monthly close, Bitcoin’s inability to reclaim momentum above $118K raises the likelihood of a deeper pullback. If bearish pressure persists, BTC price could slide toward the $112K–$110K zone before stabilising. Now the question arises whether the Bitcoin price will trigger a recovery back above $119K ahead of the monthly close, as it seems to be extremely important for a potential rebound toward the $124K to $126K range. Why the BTC Price is Plunging? The Bitcoin price has dropped nearly 3% in the past 24 hours, facing a sharp wave of selling pressure. The sudden drop comes amid a convergence of bearish macro and crypto-native pressures. One of the main triggers is renewed hawkish sentiment from the U.S. Federal Reserve. With expectations of rate cuts now pushed further out, Bitcoin is taking a major hit as investors look out for more investment options. On the other hand, the large institutional players appear to be offloading holdings, with Bitcoin ETFs recording fresh outflows. Meanwhile, the whale wallets have shown a notable rise in inflows, typically a precursor to sell-offs. The drop in the price also triggered a wave of liquidations, especially among the long traders, which intensified the decline. Therefore, if the selling pressure continues, BTC price is feared to test the $112,000 to $110,000 range, while a rise above $118,000 What to Expect from the Bitcoin (BTC) Price Rally This Week? After a few days of consolidation around the pivotal resistance of $118,500, the price plunged hard to the local support below $115,500. This pullback has dragged the rally below a crucial range, technically, and hence, continued upward pressure could place the BTC price into a pivotal support zone. The Bollinger bands have squeezed after remaining expanded since the start of the month. This suggests the token’s volume and volatility have been dropping, and an extended squeeze could compel the price to maintain a descending consolidation. On the other hand, the RSI has taken a steep drop, suggesting a massive drop in the strength of the rally. Additionally, the CMF and OBV have deviated towards the south, validating the growing dominance of the bears. The upcoming weekend is expected to turn the tables for the Bitcoin (BTC) price rally, while the current chart patterns suggest both bullish and bearish cases. If the price reclaims $118,000, then a rise above $120,000 is expected, but if it tests the $110,000 support zone and fails to defend, a deeper correction may follow.",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/has-bitcoin-nosedive-begun-heres-why-the-btc-price-is-down-today-heres-where-it-may-reach/,BTC|TRADING|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,Price Analysis|Bitcoin,BTC,"Has Bitcoin Nosedive Begun?

This latest surge in the Bitcoin Price has captivated investors and analysts alike, sparking renewed optimism across the entire crypto ecosystem. For many, it’s a clear signal that the bull market narrative is gaining stronger traction, potentially paving the way for even more remarkable milestones in the near future. The Phenomenal Bitcoin Price Ascent: A New Milestone Reached According to diligent monitoring by Bitcoin World market analysts, the Bitcoin Price has not just touched, but firmly risen above the $116,000 threshold. As of the latest reports, BTC is actively trading at an impressive $116,033.45 on the widely recognized Binance USDT market. This isn’t merely a fleeting spike; it represents a significant psychological and technical level for the digital asset, indicating robust buying pressure and a growing confidence among market participants. The journey to this point has been marked by periods of intense volatility, yet Bitcoin’s resilience continues to shine through. This latest move past $116,000 solidifies its position as a leading indicator for the broader crypto market, often pulling altcoins along in its wake. Understanding the underlying forces behind this powerful upward trajectory is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the dynamic landscape of digital finance. What’s Fueling This Remarkable Bitcoin Price Rally? Several converging factors appear to be contributing to the current robust performance of the Bitcoin Price . This isn’t a singular event but rather the culmination of various fundamental and technical developments: Institutional Inflow and Adoption: Perhaps the most significant driver has been the increasing appetite from institutional investors. The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened floodgates for traditional finance players to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. Large corporations and investment funds are increasingly allocating portions of their portfolios to BTC, viewing it as a legitimate asset class and a hedge against inflation. Macroeconomic Tailwinds: In an era of evolving global economic policies, Bitcoin’s narrative as ‘digital gold’ or a hedge against fiat currency devaluation continues to strengthen. Concerns over inflation, coupled with anticipation of potential interest rate cuts by central banks, make non-sovereign assets like Bitcoin more attractive. Investors are seeking safe havens and growth opportunities outside traditional financial instruments. Halving Hype and Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s programmatic scarcity mechanism, particularly the ‘halving’ event which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, plays a crucial role. Historically, post-halving periods have often preceded significant bull runs due to a supply shock against sustained or increasing demand. While the most recent halving has passed, its long-term effects on supply-demand dynamics are still unfolding and contributing to positive sentiment around the Bitcoin Price . Technological Progress and Network Health: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including advancements in scaling solutions (like the Lightning Network) and improvements in network security and efficiency, enhance its utility and appeal. A robust and evolving network instills greater confidence in its long-term viability and adoption. Renewed Retail Investor Interest: As the Bitcoin Price gains momentum and media attention, retail investors who might have been hesitant during bear markets are re-entering the space. This renewed interest, often fueled by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), adds significant liquidity and buying pressure to the market, creating a virtuous cycle of price appreciation and increased participation. Understanding the Market Dynamics Behind the Bitcoin Price Surge Beyond the fundamental drivers, the current market dynamics provide valuable insights into the strength and potential sustainability of this rally. Analyzing trading volumes, market sentiment, and key technical levels helps paint a clearer picture: The sustained high trading volume accompanying this price surge suggests genuine buying interest rather than speculative manipulation. Large orders are being filled, indicating institutional participation and strong conviction among buyers. Furthermore, market sentiment indicators, such as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, have shifted significantly towards ‘Greed,’ reflecting widespread optimism. Technically, breaking above $116,000 establishes a new psychological support level, potentially paving the way for Bitcoin to test higher resistance zones.

Investors are seeking safe havens and growth opportunities outside traditional financial instruments. Halving Hype and Supply Dynamics: Bitcoin’s programmatic scarcity mechanism, particularly the ‘halving’ event which reduces the supply of new Bitcoin entering the market, plays a crucial role. Historically, post-halving periods have often preceded significant bull runs due to a supply shock against sustained or increasing demand. While the most recent halving has passed, its long-term effects on supply-demand dynamics are still unfolding and contributing to positive sentiment around the Bitcoin Price . Technological Progress and Network Health: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, including advancements in scaling solutions (like the Lightning Network) and improvements in network security and efficiency, enhance its utility and appeal. A robust and evolving network instills greater confidence in its long-term viability and adoption. Renewed Retail Investor Interest: As the Bitcoin Price gains momentum and media attention, retail investors who might have been hesitant during bear markets are re-entering the space. This renewed interest, often fueled by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out), adds significant liquidity and buying pressure to the market, creating a virtuous cycle of price appreciation and increased participation. Understanding the Market Dynamics Behind the Bitcoin Price Surge Beyond the fundamental drivers, the current market dynamics provide valuable insights into the strength and potential sustainability of this rally. Analyzing trading volumes, market sentiment, and key technical levels helps paint a clearer picture: The sustained high trading volume accompanying this price surge suggests genuine buying interest rather than speculative manipulation. Large orders are being filled, indicating institutional participation and strong conviction among buyers. Furthermore, market sentiment indicators, such as the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, have shifted significantly towards ‘Greed,’ reflecting widespread optimism. Technically, breaking above $116,000 establishes a new psychological support level, potentially paving the way for Bitcoin to test higher resistance zones. Analysts are now closely watching the next significant thresholds, with some proj"
2025-07-25 10:29:26+00:00,Cipher Mining: A Leveraged Bet On Bitcoin''s Bull Cycle,"Summary Cipher is rapidly scaling hash rate from ~13.5 EH/s to 23 EH/s by late 2025, which could more than double BTC production. Despite current net losses and negative free cash flows, the company maintains low leverage, modest liquidity, and ongoing institutional support. Valuation remains low relative to sector peers like Riot and Marathon, offering a high-risk, high-reward way to gain leveraged exposure to Bitcoin’s price cycle without holding crypto directly. Cipher Mining Inc. ( CIFR ) is a rapidly growing bitcoin extraction company that can significantly increase its income due to an increasing hash rate and more efficient equipment in the coming years. Although the company is not yet profitable, the capital structure is relatively healthy, and the development pace is based on the price of Bitcoin; if it remains at a high level or continues to rise, Cipher can quickly reach positive cash flows in the coming years. For these reasons, I believe this company is worth a look and can be considered a speculative buy for exposure to cryptocurrency through the company, not the coins themselves. Financial Health So we have rapid growth, but at the same time, structural challenges to profitability and efficiency . Over the last twelve months, the company generated $152.09 million in revenue, but the net loss was $123.51 million. This is due not only to high fixed costs but also to the structure of the activity not being optimized just yet. The gross profit was $27.59 million, which means the gross margin was ~18.1%. The EBITDA was around $9.72 million, and the operating income was -$118.95 million. This indicates that the company is not yet able to achieve a positive operating profit. EPS sits at -$0.37, which demonstrates a direct loss to shareholders. Income Statement (Seeking Alpha) What about balance and liquidity? The company''s cash is $23.17 million, while the total debt is $58.38 million. Net debt is $35.21 million. The current ratio is 1.11, which indicates that the company is currently capable of covering short-term obligations but has restricted reserves. Quick ratio is just 0.41, which means that if we take out the reserves, liquid measures are not sufficient to cover short-term liabilities. The company''s equity is relatively strong—the book value per share is $1.98. The debt-to-equity ratio is 7.95%, a low level of leverage. Balance Sheet (Seeking Alpha) From a liquidity point of view, Cipher currently has about $23 million in cash when operating losses and capital costs remain significant. With such a net level and maintaining a similar money-burning rate, the company should have runway for the next 2-3 quarters, especially if the capital investment in new equipment decreases. However, the need for additional funding remains real in the third and fourth quarters of 2025, unless the price of BTC increases significantly and improves the flows. So far, Cipher has successfully attracted capital from emissions, indicating some institutional trust. Summary. Cipher Mining''s financial structure is moderately healthy—the company has little long-term debt and a certain liquidity, but high losses and negative cash flows from operating activities pose a risk to sustainability in the long term. Fixed costs, improving profitability indicators, and positive cash flows are required to maintain the operations and achieve profitability. Although the structure of the capital is not dangerous yet, the dependence on external funding indicates a higher risk of sensitivity to market changes and BTC prices. Catalysts Cipher is approaching a significant hash rate jump —from the current ~13.5 EH/s to the planned 23 EH/s at the end of 2025. Such growth is not just symbolic—it could mean that the company''s BTC extraction volumes increase by more than 60%. Bearing in mind that the results of the last quarter alone have been based on older generation equipment, new equipment implementation (like Canaan Avalon A1466 ) may mean a direct rise in income with a lower cost. This is especially important at current BTC prices. Cipher Mining Presentation for Business Update By increasing capacity, Cipher can break down fixed costs on a wider hash rate basis. This means that even at stable BTC prices, the company''s profitability potential is improving structurally. Improving operating efficiency is often a long-term investor''s main driver, and Cipher shows real progress here. Demand recovery in the BTC market after the correction of 2022-2023. In the middle of 2025, the price stabilized, but historically, such levels are only temporary. If the price of BTC surged, Cipher could generate positive EBITDA even without further development. It becomes an interesting speculative lever for the BTC price cycle. Cipher operates in Texas, a state famous for business-friendly conditions and access to abundant energy.

2025-07-25 10:30:58+00:00,IMF Confirms El Salvador Is Not Buying More Bitcoin—Just Shuffling Wallets,"The International Monetary Fund has drawn a sharp line under the latest bout of speculation over El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy, telling reporters that the Central American nation has not added to its sovereign stash. Apparent increases in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund (SBRF), the IMF said, merely reflect “movements across various government-owned wallets” and leave the country’s overall position unchanged. Is El Salvador Just Shuffling Bitcoin Wallets? IMF Communications Director Julie Kozack delivered the clarification during a regular press briefing on Thursday, responding to a question from Inner City Press reporter Matthew Lee. “As we have stated in the past, the total amount of BTC held across government-owned wallets remains unchanged, and that is consistent with El Salvador’s program commitments,” Kozack said, adding that any headline growth in the SBRF “relate[s] to movements across various government-owned wallets.” The reassurance comes less than a month after the IMF Executive Board completed El Salvador’s 2025 Article IV consultation and first review of its 40-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF). That review unlocked a $118 million tranche, bringing total disbursements under the $1.4 billion arrangement to roughly $231 million. The EFF requires the Bukele administration to keep its net BTC exposure flat while it puts public finances on what the IMF calls “a firm downward debt path.” Only hours before the IMF’s remarks, El Salvador’s official Bitcoin Office proclaimed on X: “EL SALVADOR JUST BOUGHT MORE BITCOIN,” attaching a screenshot that showed an 8 BTC purchase and a running total of 6,248.18 BTC—worth about $722 million at today’s spot price of roughly $116,000. The post echoed President Nayib Bukele’s long-standing mantra that the country buys “one Bitcoin a day,” a slogan he has repeated since November 2024. Yet the IMF insists those numbers are an accounting mirage. While the SBRF’s wallet address can show incremental inflows, an equivalent amount is typically debited from other state-controlled wallets—most notably a treasury cold-storage address used by the fiscal agency BANDESAL—leaving the republic’s consolidated position unchanged. “Risks from Bitcoin continue to be mitigated,” Kozack emphasized, praising “solid” overall programme performance, including fiscal and reserve targets “met with margins.” Under the EFF’s technical memorandum of understanding, El Salvador must cap net crypto purchases by the non-financial public sector at the level in place when the program was approved last February. The objective is to prevent further volatility on a public balance sheet that already carries Bitcoin exposure equivalent to about 2 percent of GDP. Reuters reported in March that the IMF had already warned San Salvador against “adding to government cryptocurrency exposure,” even as officials trumpeted periodic buys. As of press time, neither President Bukele nor his Bitcoin adviser Max Keiser had responded publicly to the IMF’s statement.

Following its recent high of $3,860, ETH dipped to the $3,500 zone — a key level that quickly attracted buying interest. Now, price action is pointing upward again, with Ethereum pushing to reclaim the $3,700 range, signaling bullish momentum may be back in control. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTHs Start Distributing: CDD Ratio Hits Historic Levels Despite the recent volatility, on-chain data support the case for continued upside. According to Santiment, whales have been aggressively accumulating ETH throughout the pullback. This surge in accumulation suggests that institutional players are positioning themselves ahead of the next leg of the rally, anticipating strength in the coming months. These strategic inflows have historically preceded sustained upward trends. The resilience around the $3,500 level, combined with the swift recovery attempt, underscores Ethereum’s strong bullish structure. With a favorable macro environment, regulatory clarity, and mounting institutional interest, Ethereum appears poised for continued expansion as the second half of the year unfolds. All eyes are now on whether this bounce holds and leads to a renewed breakout above resistance. Whales Add Ethereum as US Legal Clarity Boosts Bullish Outlook Ethereum’s bullish momentum is being reinforced by aggressive accumulation from major investors. According to analyst Ali Martinez, whales have purchased more than 1.13 million ETH—worth approximately $4.18 billion—over the past two weeks. This surge in buying activity marks one of the most significant accumulation phases in recent months and signals rising confidence among institutional players. The accumulation comes at a critical time for Ethereum, which has been consolidating near the $3,700 level after a brief pullback from its $3,860 high. This whale activity not only adds fuel to the ongoing price recovery but also strengthens Ethereum’s bullish structure heading into the second half of the year. Beyond market behavior, macro and regulatory shifts are also favoring Ethereum and the broader altcoin market. The recent passage of the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act by the US Congress marks a pivotal moment for crypto legislation. These new laws offer long-sought legal clarity for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and digital assets, encouraging US-based innovation and capital flows into the space. This evolving regulatory framework removes one of the biggest barriers for institutional adoption of Ethereum and DeFi. With clearer rules and a growing appetite for ETH among whales, the stage is set for a potentially explosive rally if current momentum holds.

As seen in the 4-hour chart, ETH dipped to $3,500 but quickly bounced, reclaiming the $3,700 zone and closing in on key resistance at $3,776 and $3,860.

Here''s Why!,"Ethereum (ETH), which experienced a major rally after Bitcoin''s $123,000 ATH, has experienced a decline in recent days. While the general rise in Ethereum is expected to continue where it left off, one analyst said that ETH may be heading towards an unstable period in the near term. Markus Thielen, an analyst at 10X Research known for his successful predictions, said that Ethereum is at risk of a near-term decline. Thielen noted that increasing borrowing rates on the ETH network could create ripple effects throughout the Ethereum ecosystem. The analyst stated that with the increasing interest in Ethereum, the cost of borrowing has increased and technical indicators point to overvaluation. On this point, Thielen noted that usage of the Aave lending platform has increased from 86% to 95% since July 8 as borrowing exceeds supply in the lending pool. The variable cost of borrowing wETH has increased and is currently not profitable to borrow ETH, so for the rise to continue, the number of ETH borrowers via Aave needs to decrease. However, if this situation persists, it could trigger a meaningful pullback in Ethereum, especially if funding rates and positioning remain tight.” Thielen added that although he presented a negative picture for Ethereum in the short term, he expects more positive conditions and an increase for ETH after September. *This is not investment advice.

2025-07-25 10:48:36+00:00,Hash Ribbons Signal Ends – Here’s What It Could Mean for Bitcoin’s Next Move,"The Hash Ribbons signal, which began flashing on June 25, has now completed. This points to a potential shift in Bitcoin’s mining and price cycle as the leading crypto asset saw a steep decline of 3% over the past day. Hash Ribbons End After Miner Stress According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant, the indicator triggers when the 30-day moving average of Bitcoin’s hash rate falls below the 60-day average, and signifies stress among miners who may struggle to cover operational costs. This pressure can push miners to switch off unprofitable rigs or pause their operations for a while, and at times, it forces them to sell Bitcoin to stay afloat. Historically, the Hash Ribbons indicator has tended to appear near the end of miner sell-offs, and often sets the stage for Bitcoin’s bullish phases while allowing for some market fluctuations. This most recent signal ended as the network’s hash rate began recovering, as the 30-day moving average climbed back above the 60-day average, which hinted at a stabilization in mining activity. Interestingly, the last occurrence was on June 5, as Bitcoin was nearing the $100,000 level.

The Hash Ribbons signal, which began flashing on June 25, has now completed. This points to a potential shift in Bitcoin’s mining and price cycle as the leading crypto asset saw a steep decline of 3% over the past day. Hash Ribbons End After Miner Stress According to the latest analysis shared by CryptoQuant, the indicator triggers when the 30-day moving average of Bitcoin’s hash rate falls below the 60-day average, and signifies stress among miners who may struggle to cover operational costs. This pressure can push miners to switch off unprofitable rigs or pause their operations for a while, and at times, it forces them to sell Bitcoin to stay afloat. Historically, the Hash Ribbons indicator has tended to appear near the end of miner sell-offs, and often sets the stage for Bitcoin’s bullish phases while allowing for some market fluctuations. This most recent signal ended as the network’s hash rate began recovering, as the 30-day moving average climbed back above the 60-day average, which hinted at a stabilization in mining activity. Interestingly, the last occurrence was on June 5, as Bitcoin was nearing the $100,000 level. While short-term corrections are still possible, CryptoQuant stated that the past cycles have shown that investing during these signals often aligns with effective entries, as miners complete their capitulation and the hash rate begins to recover.

This drop has so far gone all the way down to the 0.618 Fibonacci level, from where it is looking as though it will bounce.

2025-07-25 11:00:37+00:00,Bitcoin Pullback Remains Within Normal Volatility Range: Drawdown Analysis Shows No Signs Of Panic,"Bitcoin is making its first meaningful move since breaking its all-time highs and reaching the $123,000 level. After consolidating in a tight range for nearly two weeks, the price is now pulling back toward $115,000—marking a 6% decline from recent highs. While this retracement has stirred caution among short-term traders, data suggests there is little cause for concern at this stage. Related Reading: Bitcoin LTHs Start Distributing: CDD Ratio Hits Historic Levels According to CryptoQuant’s Bitcoin Price Drawdown Analysis chart, the current 6% pullback remains well within the normal volatility range observed during prior bull phases. This suggests the move is more likely a healthy market reset than the beginning of a deeper correction. As Bitcoin tests the lower boundary of its former range, investors will closely watch for renewed strength or signs of distribution. For now, fundamentals and long-term holder data remain supportive, keeping bullish sentiment intact despite short-term volatility. The next few sessions may determine whether BTC can bounce decisively or enter a broader consolidation phase. Bitcoin Volatility Remains Within Norms As Market Enters Critical Phase According to top analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin’s recent price action may appear sharp at first glance, but deeper analysis shows that current volatility remains well within normal historical ranges. Over the past quarter, Bitcoin’s most notable intraday drops on the 5-minute timeframe reached -10% in early June and -12% in mid-June. Meanwhile, the average weekly drawdown, represented by the green line on Adler’s chart, remains stable at 3.8%. The current -6% pullback—following Bitcoin’s recent breakout to $123K and its retrace toward $115K—sits only 2.2% deeper than this weekly average and is still far from the panic-triggering extremes seen in previous months. Despite the dramatic visual appearance, Adler emphasizes that the current correction aligns with a standard consolidation cycle often seen during bull markets. What makes this moment especially relevant is how other parts of the crypto market are behaving. While altcoins retraced heavily yesterday, today they are holding above key support levels, signaling potential strength and a possible shift in market dynamics. This resilience across major altcoins could mark a rotation of capital within the market, rather than an exit. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Realized Price Chart Reveals Key Defense Zones Amid Volatility BTC Falls Below Key Support as Volume Spikes Bitcoin has broken below the tight consolidation range it maintained for over two weeks, with price dropping sharply to a local low of $115,009 before slightly recovering to $115,759. This marks a clear technical breakdown of the horizontal channel between $115,724 and $122,077, as shown in the 4-hour chart. The breach below the lower bound coincided with a spike in volume, signaling decisive selling pressure from market participants. The drop pushed BTC below the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) simple moving averages (SMAs), both of which previously acted as dynamic support. The price is now hovering just above the $115,724 horizontal support zone, which is now being retested. A failure to hold this level could open the door to deeper retracements toward the 200-day SMA near $112,104, which could act as the next major support level.

2025-07-25 11:00:37+00:00,GENIUS Act Sparks $4 Billion Surge in Stablecoin Market,"The GENIUS Act has only just become law , but its impact on the crypto landscape is already evident. In just a week, the stablecoin market gained nearly $4 billion, pushing its total market cap above $264 billion. This surge is closely tied to the regulatory clarity the Act provides, encouraging banks, asset managers, and institutional players to step into the stablecoin sector without fear of sudden enforcement actions from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Prior to the law’s passage, discussions around institutional involvement in stablecoins were gaining momentum. In a May interview with Yahoo Finance, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong noted that he welcomed banks entering the stablecoin market, stating, “I think everybody should be able to create stablecoins.” Understanding Stablecoin Varieties As institutions prepare to enter this expanding market, attention is turning toward the design and backing of stablecoins. While all stablecoins share the goal of maintaining a stable value, they differ significantly in their methods. These tokens generally fall into four categories: fiat-backed , crypto-backed, algorithmic, and commodity-backed. Fiat-backed stablecoins, pegged 1:1 to fiat currencies like the US dollar and backed by cash or short-term government securities, dominate the market, comprising roughly 85% of the total stablecoin supply. This is the primary category targeted by the GENIUS Act, which mandates full reserves, regular audits, and licensing for issuers. The two largest fiat-backed stablecoins, USDt by Tether and USD Coin by Circle, together hold a market cap exceeding $227 billion. Crypto-backed stablecoins, such as DAI, use overcollateralized crypto assets like Ethereum and tokenized Bitcoin to maintain stability and currently represent around $4.35 billion in market capitalization. Meanwhile, algorithmic stablecoins, which adjust supply automatically to maintain their peg, have struggled with stability issues, highlighted by the collapse of Terra, and are set for separate review under the GENIUS Act. Commodity-backed stablecoins, like Pax Gold, offer backing by assets such as gold and appeal to those seeking an inflation hedge, but they face challenges related to liquidity and custody. GENIUS Act Drives Institutional Stablecoin Adoption The GENIUS Act has opened the doors for institutional players to enter the stablecoin space confidently, creating a pathway for banks and asset managers to develop and manage fiat-backed stablecoins under a clear regulatory framework. This is likely to fuel further growth, innovation, and scrutiny within the stablecoin ecosystem, setting the stage for stablecoins to become a central pillar in the evolving financial system while maintaining consumer protections and transparency.

The fresh trading disclosure shows that this time, it decided to offload Coinbase while reloading on Tesla and Bitmine. This suggests Wood might be cutting the exposure from crypto-related names and betting on electric vehicles, satellite tech, and treasury platforms to rise. On Thursday, July 24, Ark Invest offloaded 30,501 shares of Coinbase (COIN) from its ARKK and ARKW funds. The sale of $12.1 million worth of COIN shares hints at a broader portfolio shuffle.

The buying spree didn’t stop here as Ark Invest added 471,024 shares of Iridium Communications (IRDM) (worth $15.3 million). Ark spread this purchase across ARKK, ARKQ, and ARKX. Iridium is a satellite tech player gaining traction among funds betting on space-based connectivity.

2025-07-25 11:15:10+00:00,Tron Nasdaq Listing: Justin Sun’s Ambitious Three-Year Plan,"BitcoinWorld Tron Nasdaq Listing: Justin Sun’s Ambitious Three-Year Plan In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, few figures command attention quite like Justin Sun, the visionary founder of Tron (TRX). His latest announcement has sent ripples across the industry: a bold declaration that SRM Entertainment, now listed on Nasdaq, is just the first step in a grand strategy. The ultimate goal? To achieve Nasdaq-100 inclusion within three years, marking a monumental milestone for the Tron ecosystem. This ambitious move signals a new era of mainstream integration for cryptocurrencies, with the Tron Nasdaq listing leading the charge towards institutional acceptance and broader market recognition. What’s Behind Tron’s Nasdaq Listing and Sun’s Grand Vision? The journey began with SRM Entertainment’s successful entry onto Nasdaq on July 24, trading under the ticker TRON. While this initial listing is significant, Justin Sun has made it clear that it’s merely the foundation for a much larger aspiration. His vision extends far beyond a simple stock market debut; it encompasses a strategic roadmap aimed at cementing Tron’s position within the elite echelons of global finance. To understand the magnitude of this ambition, it’s essential to grasp what Nasdaq listing entails and why the Nasdaq-100 is the ultimate prize: Nasdaq Listing as a Gateway: A listing on Nasdaq signifies a company’s adherence to stringent regulatory, financial, and operational standards. It provides immense credibility, transparency, and access to a vast pool of institutional and retail investors. For a cryptocurrency-affiliated entity, this step is revolutionary, bridging the gap between decentralized digital assets and traditional financial markets. The Nasdaq-100 Index: This prestigious index comprises the 100 largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Inclusion in the Nasdaq-100 is a hallmark of success, indicating a company’s significant size, liquidity, and influence. It brings unparalleled visibility, often leading to increased investor interest and capital inflows, as many institutional funds track or invest in these index components. SRM Entertainment’s Role: The acquisition of SRM Entertainment serves as the vehicle for this ambitious Nasdaq journey. By leveraging an existing, compliant entity, Tron aims to navigate the complex regulatory landscape more smoothly, providing a direct pathway for its ecosystem to engage with traditional finance. This strategic maneuver positions the Tron Nasdaq listing as more than just a corporate event; it’s a statement about the future direction of crypto integration. Why is Nasdaq-100 Inclusion a Game Changer for Tron (TRX)? Achieving Nasdaq-100 inclusion would be a transformative event for Tron (TRX), offering a cascade of benefits that could profoundly impact its ecosystem and the broader cryptocurrency market. It’s not just about prestige; it’s about unlocking new avenues for growth, adoption, and legitimacy. Here’s why this goal is so impactful: Enhanced Legitimacy and Trust: Being part of the Nasdaq-100 would confer an unparalleled level of legitimacy on Tron. It signals to traditional investors, financial institutions, and even governments that Tron is a serious, compliant, and stable player in the global economy, capable of meeting rigorous financial standards. This can help dispel some of the skepticism often associated with the crypto space. Increased Institutional Investment: Inclusion in a major index like the Nasdaq-100 often leads to passive investment from index funds, ETFs, and other institutional portfolios that track these benchmarks. This influx of institutional capital could significantly boost liquidity for TRON-related assets and potentially stabilize their value. Broader Investor Base and Market Reach: A Tron Nasdaq listing within the Nasdaq-100 would expose the Tron brand and its underlying TRX token to millions of traditional investors who might not typically venture into direct cryptocurrency investments. This expanded reach could drive adoption, usage, and demand for TRX. Strategic TRX Accumulation Strategy: Justin Sun has explicitly stated a TRX accumulation strategy will be pursued. This means the company intends to acquire and hold more TRX tokens, potentially reducing circulating supply and creating upward price pressure, especially as the Nasdaq goals materialize. This strategy aligns the company’s financial success directly with the performance of its native token. Pioneering a New Path: Success would establish a precedent for other major cryptocurrency projects seeking mainstream financial integration. Tron could become a blueprint for how crypto ecosystems can bridge the gap between decentralized technology and regulated financial markets, potentially paving the way for further innovation and collaboration. The ripple effects of such an achievement would extend far beyond Tron, influencing how the world perceives ",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/tron-nasdaq-listing-plan/,MARKET|TRX|BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC,Crypto News|CRYPTOCURRENCY|Justin Sun|Nasdaq|TRON|TRX,BTC,"Tron Nasdaq Listing: Justin Sun’s Ambitious Three-Year Plan.

Recently, a significant Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer caught the eye of on-chain analysts, sparking considerable discussion. This isn’t just about moving digital coins; it’s about understanding the strategic maneuvers of a major crypto financial firm and what these actions might signal for the broader market. When a heavyweight like Galaxy Digital shifts substantial amounts of Bitcoin, the crypto community pays close attention, trying to decipher the underlying motives and potential impacts. Let’s dive deep into this fascinating development and explore its implications. What Exactly Happened with the Galaxy Digital Bitcoin Transfer? The core of this intriguing event revolves around a series of large-scale Bitcoin movements initiated by Galaxy Digital. According to detailed observations from the vigilant on-chain analyst @ai_9684xtpa on X, the crypto financial firm initially transferred a substantial sum of 3,715 BTC to a dozen newly created addresses. While a significant portion of these funds remained somewhat shrouded in mystery, a specific segment of this Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer quickly became the focal point of market discussions. Targeted Deposits: A total of 1,130 BTC, valued at approximately $131 million at the time of the transfer, were subsequently deposited into the hot wallets of two prominent entities in the crypto space: the leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance and the well-known market maker Wintermute. Unidentified Destinations: The remaining Bitcoin from the initial 3,715 BTC transfer found its way to four other addresses that have yet to be publicly identified or linked to specific entities. This adds an element of intrigue, as the purpose of these particular transfers remains unknown. On-Chain Transparency: This event highlights the power of on-chain analysis, where dedicated analysts monitor public blockchain data to track significant transactions, offering a level of transparency not typically found in traditional finance. Their work provides valuable insights into the movements of large players like Galaxy Digital. Such precise tracking allows the community to gain a clearer picture of institutional activity, even when the firms themselves do not publicly announce their internal asset reallocations. Understanding the destination of these funds is crucial for interpreting the potential intentions behind the Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer . Why Does a Galaxy Digital Bitcoin Transfer Matter So Much? When an entity like Galaxy Digital, a prominent financial services and investment management company in the digital asset sector, executes a large-scale Galaxy Digital Bitcoin transfer , it’s not just another transaction. These movements are often indicative of broader strategic decisions and can have a significant ripple effect across the crypto market. Unlike retail transfers, institutional movements carry substantial weight due to the sheer volume of assets involved and the sophisticated strategies typically employed by such firms. Consider these key reasons why such a transfer garners significant attention: Aspect Significance of Institutional Transfer Market Liquidity Moving large amounts of Bitcoin to exchanges like Binance can increase liquidity, potentially facilitating larger trades without significant price slippage. This is crucial for maintaining efficient markets. Market Maker Activity Depositing BTC with a market maker like Wintermute suggests preparations for significant trading activity, either to provide liquidity across various pairs or to execute large block trades. Market makers play a vital role in price discovery and market stability. Strategic Positioning Such transfers often reflect a firm’s strategic positioning in anticipation of market events, changes in client demand, or rebalancing of their asset portfolios. It could be a precursor to buying or selling activity. Confidence or Caution While not a direct signal, the nature of the transfer (e.g., moving to hot wallets vs. cold storage) can sometimes offer clues about a firm’s short-term outlook, whether it’s preparing for increased trading volume (confidence) or offloading assets (caution).

2025-07-25 11:40:11+00:00,Bitcoin Miner: Resilient Comeback as Selling Pressure Eases,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Miner: Resilient Comeback as Selling Pressure Eases The cryptocurrency world is constantly abuzz with signals and indicators, but few capture the attention of investors and analysts quite like those tied directly to the very backbone of the network: its miners. For months, whispers of selling pressure from Bitcoin miners have cast a shadow over the market, contributing to price stagnation or declines. However, a significant shift is now underway, as a crucial indicator, the Hash Ribbons, suggests that this period of intense selling may finally be behind us. This development holds immense implications for the future trajectory of Bitcoin (BTC) and could signal the dawn of a new, more bullish phase for the world’s leading cryptocurrency. Understanding the Hash Ribbons: A Key Bitcoin Miner Indicator To truly grasp the significance of the latest market signal, we must first understand the mechanism behind it: the Hash Ribbons. This fascinating on-chain indicator was developed to identify periods of stress and capitulation among Bitcoin miners . At its core, the Hash Ribbons compare two simple moving averages of Bitcoin’s hash rate—the computational power dedicated to mining new blocks and securing the network. What is Hash Rate? Think of hash rate as the collective horsepower of all the mining machines globally. A higher hash rate indicates more computational power, meaning a more secure and robust network. How are Hash Ribbons Calculated? The indicator typically uses a short-term moving average (e.g., 30-day) and a long-term moving average (e.g., 60-day) of the hash rate. The “Capitulation” Signal: A critical moment occurs when the short-term hash rate average falls below the long-term average. This “cross-down” suggests that some miners are finding it unprofitable to continue operations. They might be shutting down older, less efficient machines or even selling off their mined Bitcoin holdings to cover operational costs or upgrade equipment. This period of intense selling pressure, often driven by financial necessity, is known as “miner capitulation.” Historically, such a signal has marked a turning point. When less efficient miners are forced out, the remaining miners are stronger, and the selling pressure from distressed entities subsides. This often precedes periods of price recovery and stability for Bitcoin. The End of Bitcoin Miner Capitulation: What Does It Mean? The latest data from sources like CryptoPotato and CryptoQuant confirms a pivotal moment: the Hash Ribbons signal, which initially triggered on June 25, has now officially ended. This cessation is a strong indication that the period of intense selling pressure from Bitcoin miners , driven by the need to cover costs or liquidate assets during market downturns, has likely concluded. For many, this marks the end of a challenging phase and the beginning of renewed optimism. During a capitulation phase, miners face immense financial strain. Their primary expenses—electricity, hardware, and maintenance—are denominated in fiat currency, while their revenue is in Bitcoin. When Bitcoin’s price drops significantly, or mining difficulty increases, their profit margins shrink or disappear entirely. To stay afloat, or to exit the market gracefully, they often resort to selling their accumulated BTC, adding supply to the market and further suppressing prices. The end of this signal implies: Reduced Selling Pressure: The most immediate and direct impact is the reduction of a significant source of sell-side pressure on Bitcoin. With fewer miners needing to liquidate holdings out of necessity, there’s less downward force on the price. Miner Resilience: It suggests that the remaining miners are financially robust and capable of operating profitably at current price levels. This indicates a healthier, more sustainable mining ecosystem. Market Stability: The absence of forced selling from miners contributes to overall market stability, paving the way for potential price appreciation driven by demand. This positive shift is a welcome development for the broader crypto community, signaling a potential bottoming out of the market from a fundamental supply perspective. Historical Precedent: Do Hash Ribbons Always Predict Bitcoin Price Rebounds? One of the most compelling aspects of the Hash Ribbons indicator is its historical accuracy in pinpointing opportune moments for Bitcoin. While no indicator is foolproof, the track record of the Hash Ribbons in signaling significant price reversals after periods of miner capitulation is remarkably consistent. Let’s look at some notable instances: The 2018-2019 Bear Market Bottom: After a prolonged bear market, the Hash Ribbons signaled miner capitulation in late 2018. Following this signal, Bitcoin bottomed out and began a significant recovery throughout 2019. The March 2020 COVID-19 Crash: The abrupt market crash in March 2020 saw another capitulation signal.

The latest data from sources like CryptoPotato and CryptoQuant confirms a pivotal moment: the Hash Ribbons signal, which initially triggered on June 25, has now officially ended. This cessation is a strong indication that the period of intense selling pressure from Bitcoin miners , driven by the need to cover costs or liquidate assets during market downturns, has likely concluded. For many, this marks the end of a challenging phase and the beginning of renewed optimism. During a capitulation phase, miners face immense financial strain. Their primary expenses—electricity, hardware, and maintenance—are denominated in fiat currency, while their revenue is in Bitcoin. When Bitcoin’s price drops significantly, or mining difficulty increases, their profit margins shrink or disappear entirely. To stay afloat, or to exit the market gracefully, they often resort to selling their accumulated BTC, adding supply to the market and further suppressing prices. The end of this signal implies: Reduced Selling Pressure: The most immediate and direct impact is the reduction of a significant source of sell-side pressure on Bitcoin. With fewer miners needing to liquidate holdings out of necessity, there’s less downward force on the price. Miner Resilience: It suggests that the remaining miners are financially robust and capable of operating profitably at current price levels. This indicates a healthier, more sustainable mining ecosystem. Market Stability: The absence of forced selling from miners contributes to overall market stability, paving the way for potential price appreciation driven by demand. This positive shift is a welcome development for the broader crypto community, signaling a potential bottoming out of the market from a fundamental supply perspective. Historical Precedent: Do Hash Ribbons Always Predict Bitcoin Price Rebounds? One of the most compelling aspects of the Hash Ribbons indicator is its historical accuracy in pinpointing opportune moments for Bitcoin. While no indicator is foolproof, the track record of the Hash Ribbons in signaling significant price reversals after periods of miner capitulation is remarkably consistent. Let’s look at some notable instances: The 2018-2019 Bear Market Bottom: After a prolonged bear market, the Hash Ribbons signaled miner capitulation in late 2018. Following this signal, Bitcoin bottomed out and began a significant recovery throughout 2019. The March 2020 COVID-19 Crash: The abrupt market crash in March 2020 saw another capitulation signal. Shortly after, Bitcoin staged a powerful rebou"

2025-07-25 12:00:00+00:00,Upexi: The Market Loves Crypto Treasury Companies,"Summary Upexi is the ""Solana Treasury Company,"" a line it has recently adopted after growing out of its e-commerce phase. While it is still operational, its primary business is now crypto-focused. The market seems to adore companies like this, and Upexi has jumped over 180% since the announcement, but it is still relatively fairly valued to its net assets. This could be a great opportunity for investors bullish on Solana, but this firm is on the frontier of risky companies, and investors should tread carefully. Thankfully, options trading went live recently for Upexi, offering investors a chance to buy a protective put! Introduction As someone who considers themselves a risk manager more than an investor (the difference makes me happy even if you think there isn''t one), nothing makes me balk quite like the phrase, ""crypto treasury company."" Of course, when I see an opportunity to cover one of these companies, I want to take it — what if I''m wrong, and I discover a diamond in the rough? Enter Upexi Inc. ( UPXI ), which has had a very wild ride through the stock market, several iterations, massive spikes, and massive crashes. Now, they are a crypto treasury company. Data by YCharts That chart looks bad, but it''s a remnant of the company''s past as a hemp-CBD distributor — known as Grow Inc. at the time — then as an e-commerce brand owner for health and wellness products. Entering their Crypto Phase Let''s zoom in to just their ""crypto phase,"" which started in April of this year. See when the announcement happened? It was a crazy spike, and that got the attention of a lot of investors who had never heard of this company before, or who remember it as a very different business. Data by YCharts The announcement in question was this : [UPXI] today announced establishing a digital currency holding company to invest and capitalize on the opportunities of cryptocurrency including Bitcoin and other coins with high growth potential. Upexi has made an initial investment in Bitcoin and is actively pursuing additional investment opportunities to expand its portfolio through further direct investment into coins, mining, and M&A in the fintech space. Management...have agreed to make a strategic investment in a portfolio of Cryptocurrency including Bitcoin that could grow exponentially in the future, and shift its growth strategy to opportunities in Crypto and the Blockchain. The Company has initiated a multi-pronged go-to-market strategy with a primary portfolio investment anchored by at least a 50% of the total portfolio asset size in Bitcoin and the remainder of the portfolio in cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Ripple, Aave, Chainlink, Render, and several others. In the future, the portfolio will be available to view on the Upexi website with daily updates of Upexi''s holdings. Upexi will initially operate through two newly established, wholly owned subsidiaries to separate our investments and reporting. The two entities consist of: ChainBitMiner: A diversified portfolio of Crypto coins anchored with 50-70% of portfolio in Bitcoin held in lieu of cash on balance sheet. The company will issue periodic press releases around completed Bitcoin purchases and newly added coins to the portfolio. QuantumHash: The Company will look to capitalize with investments in Crypto mining with a main focus on Bitcoin mining. The Company does not initially plan to operate its own mining operations. Andrew Norstrud, Chief Financial Officer of Upexi, stated, ""The strategy of using debt, equity and cash flow to accumulate Bitcoin has proven very successful for many companies and their investors. We believe an expanded strategy should give investors more exposure to new coins with more potential upside while anchoring our strategy with Bitcoin. The new Trump administration has been publicly bullish and with the possibility of large financial institutions beginning to adopt this financial asset alternative, it has been clearly evident now is the time to make a strategic investment into the space.""

Institutional adoption is bigger than we… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 24, 2025 Ki Young Ju first sounded the alarm in March, when Bitcoin hovered around $83,000. At that time, every on-chain metric pointed down. The bull score hit multi-year lows. BBMC indicators and the MVRV ratio flashed red warnings. Whale liquidations piled up, and many saw a bear market beginning. Market Indicators Flash Early Warnings Support levels stood strong after an April retest. Those same bears had to eat their words when Bitcoin bounced back. By May, prices broke past the January high and surged to $112,000. This month, BTC even hit $123,000 before taking a breather. That quick turnaround forced Young Ju to admit he was wrong—and to thank investors for showing him the mistake. He now says the old cycle theory no longer applies, since institutional players don’t follow the same playbook as retail buyers. Public companies like MicroStrategy (now Strategy) and other treasury-focused firms have become major holders. They treat Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

That dual demand has built a solid floor under prices and given big whales less sway. Retail investors may still buy late and sell early. But now their moves are cushioned by far larger, long-term stakes. Experts See A New Phase Major voices in crypto echo this view. Michael Saylor has declared that the bear market era is no longer here. JAN3 chief executive officer Samson Mow and Binance CEO CZ even project that this cycle could take Bitcoin all the way to $1 million. Other big names in the industry, like ‘Rich Dad Poo Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki, believe so as well. Those bullish calls come from people who back institutional growth over hype-driven swings.

It’s a shift that could reshape Bitcoin’s usual peaks and valleys. #Bitcoin cycle theory is dead. My predictions were based on it—buy when whales accumulate, sell when retail joins. But that pattern no longer holds. Last cycle, whales sold to retail. This time, old whales sell to new long-term whales. Institutional adoption is bigger than we… — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) July 24, 2025 Ki Young Ju first sounded the alarm in March, when Bitcoin hovered around $83,000. At that time, every on-chain metric pointed down. The bull score hit multi-year lows. BBMC indicators and the MVRV ratio flashed red warnings. Whale liquidations piled up, and many saw a bear market beginning. Market Indicators Flash Early Warnings Support levels stood strong after an April retest. Those same bears had to eat their words when Bitcoin bounced back. By May, prices broke past the January high and surged to $112,000. This month, BTC even hit $123,000 before taking a breather. That quick turnaround forced Young Ju to admit he was wrong—and to thank investors for showing him the mistake. He now says the old cycle theory no longer applies, since institutional players don’t follow the same playbook as retail buyers. Public companies like MicroStrategy (now Strategy) and other treasury-focused firms have become major holders. They treat Bitcoin as a reserve asset.

That dual demand has built a solid floor under prices and given big whales less sway. Retail investors may still buy late and sell early. But now their moves are cushioned by far larger, long-term stakes. Experts See A New Phase Major voices in crypto echo this view. Michael Saylor has declared that the bear market era is no longer here. JAN3 chief executive officer Samson Mow and Binance CEO CZ even project that this cycle could take Bitcoin all the way to $1 million. Other big names in the industry, like ‘Rich Dad Poo Dad’ author Robert Kiyosaki, believe so as well. Those bullish calls come from people who back institutional growth over hype-driven swings. They see big money as a stabilizer rather than a speculator. Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView"
2025-07-25 12:01:07+00:00,Ripple Price Analysis: Is This XRP’s Calm Before the Next Crash?,"Ripple’s native token has cooled off following its recent push higher, and both XRP/USDT and XRP/BTC charts suggest this pullback may still have room to develop further. While the broader structure remains bullish, price action is consolidating just below key resistance levels, hinting at a possible short-term reset before resuming its uptrend. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The USDT Pair On the XRP/USDT daily chart, the price has rejected the $3.50 horizontal resistance zone and is now finding support inside the $3.00 demand zone. This area also overlaps with the upper boundary of the previous consolidation range. The RSI has also sharply cooled down from overbought levels, now sitting around 59, giving the bulls some breathing room. However, unless buyers defend this area convincingly, there’s a risk of further pullback toward the $2.50 region, where the 100-day and 200-day moving averages are located. The BTC Pair The XRP/BTC pair, meanwhile, has broken down from its recent short-term uptrend and is now retracing into the fair value gap around 2,680 SAT. This drop follows a failure to push through the heavy resistance zone at 3,200 SAT. While the structure remains intact for now, the price is hovering inside the FVG and just above the 200-day moving average, making this a key zone for potential reaction. A loss of this level would open the door for a deeper retest of the 2,400 SAT region, while holding it could pave the way for a new attempt toward 3,200 SAT.

2025-07-25 12:02:31+00:00,"Over $585M in Crypto Longs Liquidated as Bitcoin Falls Below $116,000","The crypto market witnessed heavy liquidations on Friday, with over half a billion dollars in long positions wiped out as Bitcoin price slipped below $116,000 amid a broader market decline. According to data from CoinGlass, $585.86 million worth of long positions were liquidated, with Bitcoin accounting for $140.06 million of the total as it dropped 2.63% to $115,356. Ether also faced sharp liquidations, with $104.76 million in longs cleared as the price fell 1.33% to $3,598. Dogecoin recorded the largest percentage drop among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, plunging 7% over 24 hours to $0.22 and triggering $26 million in liquidations. Market Faces Leverage Flush as Bitcoin Bulls Get Caught The sudden downturn, described by crypto trader Ash Crypto as a “pure leverage flush,” caught many traders off guard. “Many people longed Alts after they saw ETH pumping hard, so market makers dumped and liquidated the late longs,” Ash Crypto explained on X. In total, 213,729 traders were liquidated during the market drop, illustrating the high levels of leverage in recent trading activity amid the bullish momentum that had driven Bitcoin to a new all-time high of $123,100 on July 14. Across both short and long positions, approximately $731.93 million was cleared from the market, underscoring the volatility that continues to characterize crypto trading. Despite the pullback, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index maintained a “Greed” score of 70 on Friday, indicating continued optimism among market participants. Sentiment Remains Bullish Despite Liquidations Several crypto leaders and analysts remain positive on the market’s direction despite the flush of leveraged positions. Galaxy Digital CEO Michael Novogratz stated on Thursday that he expects Ether to reach $4,000 amid rising institutional adoption . Meanwhile, Bitfinex analysts noted in a report that Bitcoin’s next major target could be $136,000 if the current uptrend persists. However, traders are exercising caution, hedging against the possibility of a swift reversal in Bitcoin price. A return to Thursday’s price level of $119,500 would place approximately $3.07 billion worth of short positions at risk of liquidation, indicating the potential for further volatility as bulls and bears battle for control.

However, as upward momentum slowed, BTC and ETH entered a consolidation phase following their rallies. While the bullish mood in the market is expected to continue, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. These options are more important because they fall on the last Friday of both the week and the month. According to data for the fourth week of July, $12.3 billion worth of Bitcoin and $2.7 billion worth of Ethereum options will expire on July 25 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.88, the maximum loss point is $112,000 and the notional value is $12.66 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 0.87, a maximum loss point of $2,800, and a notional value of $2.75 billion. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin''s price following the $12.66 billion options expiration on July 25th.

While the cryptocurrency is trading at over $116,738, nearly $15 billion in leveraged short positions on exchanges like Binance , Bybit, and OKX is now exposed heading into the weekend, according to the latest data from CoinGlass retrieved on July 25. The liquidation heatmap also reveals a dense buildup of potential buybacks that could propel the asset higher if it breaches the $120,000 resistance zone. For the sake of clarification, the chart below highlights the areas with the highest concentration of leveraged positions, as well as the areas where those positions are most at risk. The rising green curve on the right side indicates the level of short liquidation leverage, showing where traders are most likely to be wiped out. BTC exchange liquidation map. Source: CoinGlass Observing the data, we see the curve rising more rapidly past the $120,000 mark, where a large cluster of leveraged liquidity is concentrated. As soon as BTC begins approaching those levels, it could set off a chain reaction, trapping late short sellers and launching the cryptocurrency even higher. Put simply, the chart reveals just how much capital is currently betting against Bitcoin rising. If BTC moves higher, these short positions will start losing money, and if it climbs fast enough, exchanges will begin automatically liquidating them. Usually, when shorts are forced to close, the event triggers buy orders as traders have to purchase more Bitcoin to cover their positions. That sudden wave of buying pressure typically drives the price even higher, causing a cascade of additional liquidations, as we have observed during the 2020 and 2021 short squeezes. Bitcoin short liquidation leverage summary At first glance, the chart might look overwhelming, but it simply pinpoints where leveraged traders are most vulnerable. Right now, the traders in the danger zone are those betting against Bitcoin going up past more or less $120,000. Of course, there is no guarantee that BTC will really rise, but the $14.69 billion in short exposure is still a bullish indicator because it shows how volatile the current price is. That is, if a strong enough growth catalyst appears, the price changes that follow could potentially be sudden and explosive instead of gradual.

2025-07-25 12:12:49+00:00,"Why Is Crypto Down Today? – July 25, 2025","Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by another 5.1%, moving further away from the recently reached $4 trillion, now standing at $3.84 trillion. Overall, the market is down today. The majority of the top 100 coins per market capitalization are still red since yesterday. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $225 billion. It has maintained similar levels for several days now. TLDR: Crypto market cap has distanced further from the recently hit $4 trillion; More coins among the top 100 are green today compared to yesterday, but the majority are still red; BTC is down to $115,282, and ETH is up to $3,621; Market sentiment continues decreasing, indicating rising caution; US ETH spot ETFs continued the inflow streak with the 15th day in a row; US BTC spot ETFs resumed positive flows; ’The current period of sideways movement in BTC has weakened investor enthusiasm and triggered profit-taking’; The correction seems to be a healthy pause within a larger upward trend; Metrics suggest early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. Crypto Winners & Losers Unlike yesterday, when all top 10 coins per market capitalization were red, five are green today and three are red (not counting the two stablecoins). Bitcoin (BTC) decreased by 2% in a day, now trading at $115,282. At the same time, Ethereum (ETH) is up by 1.9% over the same period. It’s now trading at $3,621. Tron (TRX) increased the most: 3.6% to the price of $0.3148. On the other hand, Solana (SOL) fell the most: 2.8%, currently changing hands at $177.57. In the top 100 coins category, around 25 coins are green, which is a notable increase from yesterday’s four. Two of these recorded double-digit increases. Ethena (ENA) is up 14.8% to $0.4933, while Curve DAO (CRV) appreciated 11.3% to $1.02. Notably, the decreases are not very high. The highest of these is Mantle (MNT)’s 3.5%, now standing at $0.7354. Jupiter (JUP) follows with a 2.9% drop to $0.5243. Also, over 24 hours, over $721 million in leveraged crypto bets were liquidated, with Ethereum, Bitcoin, and XRP at the top. Investor attention was also focused on Galaxy Digital , as it transferred a whopping 17,123 BTC to multiple centralised exchanges over 12 hours.

While Bitcoin ETFs still dominate in overall assets, Ethereum’s rise is narrowing the gap and hinting at changing investor sentiment. For many, Ether funds are becoming a preferred vehicle to tap into Ethereum’s rally without the complications of direct token custody. The turnaround in ETH’s price, from April lows near $1,400 to around $3,600, has added fuel to the fire. Analysts say renewed investor interest is being driven partly by the U.S. push toward stablecoin regulation.

2025-07-25 12:20:01+00:00,Bitcoin sa dnes ráno prepadol na 115 000 $. Je vhodný čas na nákup?,"V piatok ráno došlo na kryptomenovom trhu k výraznému odpredaju, ktorý mal za následok likvidáciu dlhých pozícií v celkovej hodnote viac ako 585 miliónov dolárov . Hlavným dôvodom bola prudká korekcia ceny Bitcoinu, ktorá sa prepadla pod hranicu 115 000 dolárov . Expirácia júlových opcií na Bitcoine zvýšila odpredaje Nedávna expirácia mesačných opcií na burze Deribit priniesla ďalšiu vlnu volatility. Cena $BTC klesla do pásma okolo 115 000 $. Hoci expirácia bola o niečo nižšia v porovnaní s minulým mesiacom, trh zostáva mimoriadne volatilný a pohyby na derivátových trhoch sa premietajú aj do spotových cien. Options Expiry Alert Tomorrow, over $15.4B in BTC and ETH options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $12.66B notional | Put/Call: 0.88 | Max Pain: $112K $ETH : $2.75B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $2,800 Last month’s H1 expiry hit $17B. This week’s is not far… pic.twitter.com/5nFSk7qDPg — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 24, 2025 Je evidentné, že expirácia opcií vytvorila dodatočný tlak na hodnotu Bitcoinu. Počas kľúčových hodín pred expiráciou sa Bitcoin obchodoval na úrovni 115 549 $. Cena sa neúprosne približovala k takzvanej hladine Max Pain, na úrovni 112 000 dolárov. Ide o úroveň, pri ktorej sa najväčší počet kontraktov označí ako „nevýherný“. V takomto prípade sú vo výhode vypisovatelia opcií. Deribit v najnovšej správe informoval, že hodnota všetkých expirovaných opcií dosiahla tento mesiac 15,45 miliardy dolárov. Bitcoinové opcie mali hodnotu 12,66 miliardy dolárov a Ethereum 2,75 miliardy $.

Analytici z Bitfinexu zase v najnovšej trhovej správe uviedli, že ak sa trhová štruktúra na Bitcoine výrazne nezmení, aktívum môže pokračovať v raste na ďalšiu významnú métu až 136 000 dolárov.

Je vhodný čas na nákup?. V piatok ráno došlo na kryptomenovom trhu k výraznému odpredaju, ktorý mal za následok likvidáciu dlhých pozícií v celkovej hodnote viac ako 585 miliónov dolárov . Hlavným dôvodom bola prudká korekcia ceny Bitcoinu, ktorá sa prepadla pod hranicu 115 000 dolárov . Expirácia júlových opcií na Bitcoine zvýšila odpredaje Nedávna expirácia mesačných opcií na burze Deribit priniesla ďalšiu vlnu volatility. Cena $BTC klesla do pásma okolo 115 000 $. Hoci expirácia bola o niečo nižšia v porovnaní s minulým mesiacom, trh zostáva mimoriadne volatilný a pohyby na derivátových trhoch sa premietajú aj do spotových cien. Options Expiry Alert Tomorrow, over $15.4B in BTC and ETH options are set to expire on Deribit. $BTC : $12.66B notional | Put/Call: 0.88 | Max Pain: $112K $ETH : $2.75B notional | Put/Call: 0.87 | Max Pain: $2,800 Last month’s H1 expiry hit $17B. This week’s is not far… pic.twitter.com/5nFSk7qDPg — Deribit (@DeribitOfficial) July 24, 2025 Je evidentné, že expirácia opcií vytvorila dodatočný tlak na hodnotu Bitcoinu. Počas kľúčových hodín pred expiráciou sa Bitcoin obchodoval na úrovni 115 549 $. Cena sa neúprosne približovala k takzvanej hladine Max Pain, na úrovni 112 000 dolárov. Ide o úroveň, pri ktorej sa najväčší počet kontraktov označí ako „nevýherný“. V takomto prípade sú vo výhode vypisovatelia opcií. Deribit v najnovšej správe informoval, že hodnota všetkých expirovaných opcií dosiahla tento mesiac 15,45 miliardy dolárov. Bitcoinové opcie mali hodnotu 12,66 miliardy dolárov a Ethereum 2,75 miliardy $. Preskúmať funkcie bitcoinovej peňaženky Best Wallet K výraznej zmene sentimentu obchodníkov však nedošlo Aj napriek nedávnemu poklesu mnohí obchodníci sú optimistickí. Podľa aktuálnych údajov Crypto Fear & Greed, index dosahuje hodnotu 70 bodov , čo stále signalizuje vysokú expozíciu obchodníkov voči digitálnym aktívam. Zdroj: alternative.me Optimistické očakávania podporujú aj viaceré osobnosti z kryptomenového sektora. Generálny riaditeľ spoločnosti Galaxy Digital, Michael Novogratz, vo štvrtok uviedol, že očakáva rast ceny Etherea na minimálne 4 000 dolárov, čo predstavuje približne 9,8 % nárast oproti aktuálnej hodnote. Analytici z Bitfinexu zase v najnovšej trhovej správe uviedli, že ak sa trhová štruktúra na Bitcoine výrazne nezmení, aktívum môže pokračovať v raste na ďalšiu významnú métu až 136 000 dolárov.
