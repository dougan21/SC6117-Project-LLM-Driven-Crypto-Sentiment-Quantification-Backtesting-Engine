2025-07-17 15:00:24+00:00,"Asia has a violent crypto crime problem, Chainalysis H1 2025 report","Crypto crime numbers in the first half of 2025 have already surpassed all of 2024’s stolen funds, and Asia is reportedly at the center of it all. A mid-year report by blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis released Thursday revealed more than $2.17 billion has been stolen from crypto services, placing this year on course to become the worst in crypto theft history. Per the software and blockchain security firm’s findings , the biggest contributor to the baffling numbers in stolen funds was the $1.5 billion Bybit hack, linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group . The breach is the largest individual hack ever recorded in crypto and has already outpaced the group’s total 2024 haul of $1.3 billion. “If current trends continue, stolen funds from services could eclipse $4 billion by year’s end,” Chainalysis wrote. Asia tops geographic crime hotspots Regionally, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Central and Southern Asia and Oceania (CSAO) have seen the most rapid growth in victim counts year-over-year. Stolen Assets YTD by region. Source: Chainalysis In terms of value stolen, North America leads in both Bitcoin and altcoin theft. Europe ranks first globally in ether and stablecoin theft. Security professionals believe the cases have gone up due to the mass adoption of these assets in both regions, or simply a preference among cybercriminals for liquid and easily transferred tokens. APAC is second for Bitcoin theft and third for Ethereum, while CSAO holds second place for both altcoin and stablecoin theft. Sub-Saharan Africa is among the lowest in stolen value, which the report deemed was more due to economic factors, less exposure to crypto, than better security. Stolen funds blockchain movement. Source: Chainalysis. Chainalysis shared a chart showing that Bitcoin wallet holders are more likely to suffer larger financial losses. The number of victims on chains outside the Bitcoin and EVM ecosystems, like Solana, has also ticked upwards. Half of 2025 breaks record for crypto-related thefts The Chainalysis report mentioned that year-to-date thefts through June 2025 are already 17% higher than those seen in the first half of 2022, which previously held the record for the worst year with $3.8 billion in total crypto stolen. “Stolen fund activity stands out as the dominant concern in 2025,” the report stated, adding that other forms of crypto crime have shown mixed trends, but thefts have grown exponentially. Chainalysis also found that scammers and criminals have changed their focus from major platforms to individual wallet holders. Security at centralized services has been improving, so attackers are now targeting private wallets with what the company has dubbed “more refined methods.” This trend, the report suggests, relies on AI tools to help perpetrators in phishing, impersonation, and identity theft. Approximately 23.35% of thefts so far in 2025 have been caused by physical violence, including threats, assault, and in some cases, homicide. The analysis also discussed the threat posed by so-called “wrench attacks,” where attackers use force or coercion to obtain access to a victim’s wallet keys. It also explained that thieves were more likely to up their activities when Bitcoin’s price was treading on the upper side of market volatility. “The future increase in asset values (and the perception of its future upward movement) may trigger additional opportunistic physical attacks against known crypto holders,” Chainalysis wrote. Still, it reiterated that the “true scale” of such incidents is likely underreported. Among the cases cited in the report is the March 2025 abduction and murder of Elison Steel CEO Anson Que in the Philippines. Que and his driver were kidnapped in Bulacan and later found dead in Rizal province. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Meanwhile, the CLARITY Act seeks to resolve longstanding jurisdictional turf wars between the SEC and CFTC by offering concrete definitions for digital assets: whether they fall under the category of securities, commodities, or stablecoins. The Anti-CBDC Act sends an equally clear message—by prohibiting the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency, lawmakers are affirming a stance on financial privacy. These proposals show more than policy evolution—they indicate the beginning of a new phase where crypto is no longer treated as an outsider asset class. Crypto exchanges and investors are already repositioning for a future shaped by regulatory frameworks, not just code and community. Behind the Optimism: Global Context and Institutional Pressure While U.S. crypto stakeholders are celebrating legislative momentum, not everyone sees this as a leading achievement. For example, Manthan Davé, co-founder of Ripple-backed custodian Palisade, argues the GENIUS Act represents progress—but only in the context of the U.S. playing catch-up. Europe’s MiCA framework , Davé notes, already demonstrates how regulation can empower rather than constrain innovation. By contrast, the GENIUS Act risks building a fragmented stablecoin structure that fails to interoperate with decentralized finance protocols. Without pathways for regulated entities to issue stablecoins that are fully composable within on-chain financial systems, the U.S. could miss a key opportunity to shape the future of tokenized finance. Davé points out that if U.S. stablecoins evolve into tightly controlled, non-interoperable digital dollars, they’ll resemble traditional money more than they will transformative Web3 infrastructure. The true value of stablecoins lies not only in their backing, but in their ability to serve as programmable, borderless collateral, integral to lending, settlement, and tokenised Treasury markets. He argues that without this flexibility, institutional capital will flow to jurisdictions where composability is enabled and innovation doesn’t face unnecessary roadblocks. Markets Respond to Policy Momentum Investor sentiment has already turned bullish in anticipation of a regulatory breakthrough. Bitcoin surged past $120,000 on Monday, briefly touching $123,000—marking a new record high and reinforcing the view that legal clarity could serve as a major catalyst for digital asset inflows. At the time of publication, Bitcoin is trading at $118,144. Analysts attribute the recent surge to growing confidence that regulation could unlock sidelined institutional capital. With defined categories for tokens, stablecoin compliance measures, and a halt to retail CBDC development, the market is interpreting this shift as a green light for scaled participation. Bitget’s Gracy Chen notes that institutional appetite is closely tied to certainty. Clear licensing paths for stablecoins, plus delineated regulatory responsibilities, could improve market integrity and lower barriers to entry. While smaller firms may face pressure from compliance costs, the long-term trajectory points toward a rules-based market where crypto can operate on the same footing as traditional finance.

2025-07-17 15:18:06+00:00,"Nearly 70 Trump Officials Hold Crypto, Some With up to $120M in Investments: Report","Nearly 70 nominees and officials in the Trump administration reportedly hold crypto or investments in blockchain companies, with holdings ranging from modest sums to over $120 million. Key Takeaways: Nearly 70 Trump administration officials and nominees hold crypto, with stakes up to $120 million. Several former crypto leaders who supported Trump’s 2024 campaign have secured government positions. The administration’s hands-off regulatory approach has coincided with a surge in Bitcoin’s price. The group includes Vice President JD Vance and seven Cabinet members or nominees, who collectively disclosed at least $2 million in crypto assets, according to a detailed investigation by The Washington Post . President Donald Trump himself has declared a personal stake of at least $51 million in digital assets amid the administration’s deep financial ties to the industry. Crypto Leaders Behind Trump’s Campaign Secure Key Government Roles Many of these officials are former tech and crypto leaders who supported Trump’s 2024 campaign before securing influential positions. Some examples include Scott Kupor, managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz who is now head of the Office of Personnel Management, and Jonathan Gould, former chief legal officer at blockchain firm Bitfury and current leader of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Others include ambassadors and regulators, with some holding among the largest individual crypto portfolios. These include Ken Howery, Trump’s ambassador to Denmark with at least $122 million in digital assets. Tilman Fertitta, ambassador to Italy and owner of the Houston Rockets, and Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, also reported between $1 million and $2 million in cryptocurrencies. The widespread presence of crypto holdings among Trump’s appointees marks a notable shift in how digital assets are viewed at the highest levels of government. The timing coincides with a largely hands-off regulatory approach from the administration toward digital currencies. Policies supported by the crypto sector, including legislation on stablecoins, have advanced in Congress. The SEC has paused or dropped litigation against numerous crypto firms, reversing the aggressive scrutiny of the previous administration. Bitcoin’s price has surged to new highs during this period, doubling since last year, benefiting officials with holdings. While some appointees have divested or plan to do so shortly after confirmation, the disclosures reveal a complex relationship between government officials and the crypto industry. Critics warn that this creates potential conflicts of interest and normalizes risky crypto investments among public servants.

High-profile officials with crypto assets include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent , who divested before taking office, and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., holding between $1 million and $5 million. The tech sector’s integration into government continues with figures like Scott Kupor and Jonathan Gould taking top roles.

According to the press release shared with Cryptonews , the team will introduce a suite of tools that will hasten the development of Bitcoin Capital Markets. This, they say, includes a natively cross-chain Bitcoin wrapper that will enable BTC trading onchain. Additionally, it’ll include a software development kit (SDK) for native BTC deposits to “any app on any chain,” as well as several BTC yield products to onboard BTC. Lombard Finance The announcement names a suite of ‘Bitcoin Middleware’ as a core part of this roadmap. This suite will connect Bitcoin liquidity with “any platform, chain, or application that can put it to work.” It will comprise a new Bitcoin primitive and the Lombard SDK. Moreover, Lombard Finance will launch tokenized and structured products this year. This will include a basis trade vault and a tokenized options vault. Overall, the roadmap introduces a cross-chain, wrapped BTC, fully backed 1:1 with BTC. It will be “an ecosystem-neutral public good with permissionless minting and no mint and redeem fees.” Further, it introduces a variety of tokenized and institutional products; Lombard Ledger as a Bitcoin Bridge; a BTC yield marketplace that covers DeFi, CeFi, and TradFi strategies; and the LBTC SDK toolkit. LBTC is the protocol’s liquid staking token. This toolkit will enable “any chain, protocol, or wallet to embed native BTC deposits and yield directly into their applications.” The team argues that, by developing the assets, infrastructure, and onboarding tools to bring Bitcoin onchain, $500 billion can be created from onboarding BTC and $6 trillion in exponential value with developers innovating further. ▍▍▍▍▍▍▍Loading… pic.twitter.com/UEMnq3e3aG — Lombard (@Lombard_Finance) July 16, 2025 “Lombard aims to make Bitcoin ubiquitous throughout all major ecosystems, enabling developers to build the next generation of Bitcoin trading, lending, and payments applications with the simplicity users expect,” the announcement says.

The protocol aims to be “the driving force” for Bitcoin onchain as Tether and Circle are for stablecoins. “With the infrastructure in place, we’re convinced the Bitcoin community will become a leader in onchain innovation,” he concluded. Meanwhile, in July 2024, Lombard said it had raised $16 million in a funding round led by Polychain Capital . Lombard announced its production-ready toolkit LBTC SDK in April 2025.

2025-07-17 15:20:45+00:00,"Bitcoin’s Incredible Surge: BTC Price Breaks $119,000 Barrier","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin’s Incredible Surge: BTC Price Breaks $119,000 Barrier The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with excitement as Bitcoin (BTC) has once again captured headlines, soaring past the significant $119,000 mark. This impressive climb, observed on major exchanges like Binance, where BTC is trading at $119,017.7 on the USDT market, has ignited widespread speculation and optimism across the entire cryptocurrency market . What does this latest surge mean for investors, and what factors are truly propelling Bitcoin to these new heights? Let’s dive deep into the forces at play and explore the broader implications for both seasoned and aspiring crypto investors . Understanding the Bitcoin Phenomenon: What’s Driving This Powerful BTC Price Rally? The recent ascent of Bitcoin above $119,000 isn’t just a random fluctuation; it’s a testament to a complex interplay of fundamental and technical factors. For many, this milestone signals renewed confidence in digital assets and underscores Bitcoin’s growing maturity as a global financial instrument. But what exactly is fueling this impressive BTC price rally? Key Drivers Behind Bitcoin’s Ascent: Institutional Adoption: One of the most significant catalysts has been the increasing influx of institutional capital. Major financial players, from hedge funds to corporate treasuries, are allocating portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, viewing it as a legitimate store of value and an inflation hedge. The approval and launch of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in various jurisdictions have provided easier, regulated access for traditional investors, bridging the gap between conventional finance and the digital asset space. Companies like MicroStrategy continue to aggressively accumulate BTC, signaling long-term conviction. Halving Event Impact: Historically, Bitcoin’s halving events – which reduce the supply of new BTC entering the market by half – have preceded significant bull runs. While the most recent halving occurred some time ago, its long-term effects on supply scarcity continue to exert upward pressure on the BTC price . Less new supply against sustained or increasing demand naturally leads to higher prices. Macroeconomic Factors: In an era of global economic uncertainty, high inflation, and quantitative easing by central banks, Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a hedge against currency debasement. Investors are seeking alternative assets that are not directly tied to traditional financial systems, and Bitcoin, with its decentralized and finite supply, fits this narrative perfectly. Growing Retail Interest and FOMO: As Bitcoin’s price climbs, it naturally attracts more attention from retail investors. The Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) can create a self-reinforcing cycle, drawing new money into the market and pushing prices even higher. Social media sentiment and mainstream media coverage also play a crucial role in amplifying this effect. Technological Advancements and Network Security: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements to the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, and protocol upgrades like Taproot, enhance Bitcoin’s utility and scalability. The robustness and security of the Bitcoin network, backed by its vast mining power, also instill confidence in investors. These factors collectively create a powerful tailwind for Bitcoin , pushing its valuation higher and reinforcing its position as the leading cryptocurrency. Understanding these drivers is crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet rewarding world of digital assets. Decoding Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics: A Look Beyond the Numbers While Bitcoin often sets the tone, the broader cryptocurrency market is a complex ecosystem influenced by a myriad of factors. To truly understand the significance of Bitcoin’s rise, we must look at the underlying dynamics that govern this innovative yet often unpredictable financial landscape. The market’s behavior is not solely dependent on Bitcoin’s movements; it’s a tapestry woven with technological innovation, regulatory shifts, global economic sentiment, and investor psychology. Key Aspects of Cryptocurrency Market Dynamics: Market Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price swings. While this presents opportunities for high returns, it also carries significant risks. Understanding historical volatility patterns and how they relate to market news or macroeconomic events is key. Correlation with Traditional Markets: Increasingly, the crypto market shows correlations with traditional financial markets, particularly tech stocks.

The latest increase has seen the price of the HINU token rise from $0.00018850 to $0.00018905. Husky Inu crossed the $800,000 milestone on Wednesday and has raised $823,979 so far, with investor interest in crypto projects surging after the market’s latest rally. Husky Inu (HINU) Registers Price Increase Husky Inu (HINU) has registered the latest price increase of its pre-launch phase, rising from $0.00018850 to $0.00018905. The token’s next price jump will see its value increase to $0.00018960. The price jump was the third this week and is part of the project’s ongoing pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, 2025. The pre-launch phase aims to empower the fledgling Husky Inu community, allowing the project to continue its fundraising efforts as its launch date draws closer. The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, with the HINU token price rising every two days. This strategy has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross the $800,000 milestone. The dynamic pricing strategy has helped the project raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community. The pricing strategy rewards early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. With the pre-launch phases underway, token prices will steadily increase every two days, following a compounded growth model, and will continue rising until all tokens sell out. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the Husky Inu community and ensure those joining the project can benefit from favorable pricing. Fundraising Gathers Pace The project’s fundraising efforts have gathered steam in recent weeks as markets rally and crypto sees renewed interest among investors. Thanks to Husky Inu’s progressive pricing strategy, the project has been able to raise funds faster while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its community. As a result, the project has crossed crucial landmarks in its fundraising journey, including the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. Husky Inu has raised $823,979 so far and remains on track to achieve its fundraising goal of $1.2 million Markets Continue Rising As Ethereum (ETH) Soars The crypto market cap rose to $3.8 trillion as most cryptocurrencies traded in positive territory. However, Bitcoin (BTC) declined over the past 24 hours, slipping below $118,000 to $117,970. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) rose over 8% in the past 24 hours and nearly 24% over the past week. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency soared past $3,400 earlier today, with buyers setting their sights on $$3,500. Ripple (XRP) is up over 10%, trading around $3.25, while Solana (SOL) is up 6%, as it closes in on $180.

The pre-launch phase is the next step in the project’s roadmap, allowing it to raise capital to fund platform improvements, ongoing developments, marketing initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. The project adopted a dynamic pricing strategy during the pre-launch phase, with the HINU token price rising every two days. This strategy has been instrumental in the project’s fundraising efforts, helping it cross the $800,000 milestone. The dynamic pricing strategy has helped the project raise funds while maintaining a favorable price for its fledgling community. The pricing strategy rewards early adopters of the project while promoting transparent growth. With the pre-launch phases underway, token prices will steadily increase every two days, following a compounded growth model, and will continue rising until all tokens sell out. The pre-launch phase is designed to empower the Husky Inu community and ensure those joining the project can benefit from favorable pricing. Fundraising Gathers Pace The project’s fundraising efforts have gathered steam in recent weeks as markets rally and crypto sees renewed interest among investors. Thanks to Husky Inu’s progressive pricing strategy, the project has been able to raise funds faster while maintaining favorable pricing and empowering its community. As a result, the project has crossed crucial landmarks in its fundraising journey, including the $750,000 milestone on May 16 and the $800,000 milestone on June 15. Husky Inu has raised $823,979 so far and remains on track to achieve its fundraising goal of $1.2 million Markets Continue Rising As Ethereum (ETH) Soars The crypto market cap rose to $3.8 trillion as most cryptocurrencies traded in positive territory. However, Bitcoin (BTC) declined over the past 24 hours, slipping below $118,000 to $117,970. On the other hand, Ethereum (ETH) rose over 8% in the past 24 hours and nearly 24% over the past week. The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency soared past $3,400 earlier today, with buyers setting their sights on $$3,500. Ripple (XRP) is up over 10%, trading around $3.25, while Solana (SOL) is up 6%, as it closes in on $180.

2025-07-17 15:47:22+00:00,XRP on the Brink of ATH: Just 4.9% From Uncharted Price Territory,"After weathering years of legal turmoil and persistent FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), XRP has regained strong momentum, reclaiming its position as the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency and nearing its all-time high (ATH) of $3.40. XRP Eyes Price Discovery Territory According to market analyst Adex crypt, “XRP is eyeing a breakout into price discovery territory, something we haven’t seen since 2017. If it clears the all-time high, things could get very interesting.” Having reclaimed the psychological price of $3, XRP might be gearing toward a price discovery phase, a scenario seen 8 years ago. If this sees the light of day by breaching the ATH price of $3.40, Adex crypt believes XRP might soar to unprecedented heights. Notably, XRP’s breakout is being fueled by a rare convergence of bullish technicals, rising futures ETF interest, and intensified whale activity. For instance, on‑chain metrics confirm institutional interest with more than over 2.2 billion XRP worth a whopping $6.6 billion has been acquired by whale‑level wallets in the past fortnight. Furthermore, open interest in XRP derivatives has swelled to approximately $9.25 billion, showing heightened market liquidity and activity. If the $3 level holds and volume keeps rising, XRP could break past historical resistance, paving the way for a potential run toward $4, $5, or beyond. Why XRP is Edging Closer to Its ATH of $3.40 Having overtaken Tether (USDT) to become the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, XRP continues to witness explosive momentum. Now trading at $3.24 , it''s just 4.9% shy of its all-time high of $3.40 set in January 2018. Technical Breakout Nearing XRP recently broke above the key psychological and technical threshold of $3, a breakout supported by tight consolidation between $2.85–$2.93, representing the strongest structure since May 2025. Chart patterns, such as symmetrical triangles, higher lows, and Bollinger Band compression all signal increasing odds of a breakout toward $3.40–$3.50. Institutional-Grade Catalysts July 18 brings the ProShares XRP Futures ETF , generating strong anticipation. Large trading desks are actively accumulating ahead of its listing, and Canada’s XRP ETF has already drawn over $50 million in inflows. Furthermore, a pending vote by the U.S. House on the GENIUS , CLARITY, and Anti‑CBDC bills is contributing to optimism around crypto legislation. A favorable outcome could also nudge the SEC to drop its appeal in the Ripple case. The launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD and the company’s credible pursuit of a U.S. banking charter are also strengthening XRP’s real-world utility narrative. Momentum from Bitcoin & Broader Crypto Market Bitcoin recently hit an all‑time high above $120,000, fueling a broader crypto rally that has uplifted altcoins across the board, including XRP. As a result, XRP is currently scaling heights with a monthly surge of 46.1%. Bullish Analyst Targets Veteran chartist Peter Brandt has projected a 60% rally for XRP, targeting around $4.47, triggering further validation to its upside potential. Short-term forecasts also point to immediate targets between $3.40–$3.60, with potential for $4.50 if current momentum sustains. Conclusion XRP’s break above $3 backed by robust technical patterns, significant ETF progress , whale accumulation, and regulatory breakthroughs strongly supports the thesis that it’s entering price discovery, bringing it perilously close to its ATH of $3.40. If momentum holds, a rapid ascent through $4 and beyond seems increasingly plausible. However, caution should not be thrown to the wind due to short-term retracements, especially in the 2.85 to $3 range.",coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/10022/xrp-on-the-brink-of-ath-just-4-9-from-uncharted-price-territory,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|BTC,News|Ripple,BTC,"XRP on the Brink of ATH: Just 4.9% From Uncharted Price Territory.

2025-07-17 15:55:12+00:00,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips Below $118,000 As Selling Pressure Returns","Bitcoin (BTC) has registered a notable decline over the past 24 hours, with the flagship cryptocurrency down nearly 1%. BTC fell below $118,000 earlier today as selling pressure returned, and is trading around $117,700. Despite sluggish price action since Tuesday, analysts believe BTC’s rally is far from over, stating that the price could rise another 25% before hitting resistance. BlackRock Ramps Up Bitcoin Acquisition BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is ramping up its Bitcoin purchases. According to data from Arkham Intelligence, the asset manager has purchased 3,478 BTC for around $416 million. BlackRock’s last Bitcoin purchase was last week when it purchased $216 million worth of the asset. The latest purchase takes BlackRock’s Bitcoin portfolio to 716,500 BTC , worth over $85 billion, making it one of the largest holders of the asset. “BLACKROCK IS BUYING BTC . BlackRock just bought $416M of Bitcoin. Current Holdings: $85.47 BTC (3.6% of circulating supply)” The asset manager’s purchase comes as demand for its IBIT ETF skyrockets. IBIT is leading US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs in daily inflows. According to the latest market data, Bitcoin ETFs recorded $799 million in inflows over the past 24 hours. Matador Technologies Plans 6,000 BTC Purchase Bitcoin solutions firm Matador Technologies plans to purchase 6,000 BTC by 2027, significantly accelerating its Bitcoin buying strategy. The firm announced that it plans to buy 1,000 BTC on or before 2026, as it plans to accumulate 6,000 BTC by 2027. Matador currently holds 77.4 BTC worth around $9 million. The firm’s long-term goal is to hold 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply and become one of the top 20 holders of the asset. Deven Soni, CEO of Matador Technologies, stated, “Our business is structured around Bitcoin as a core asset.” Soni added that the firm’s new approach extends beyond treasury management and also includes infrastructure and operational components. Matador had filed a 900 million Canadian dollar shelf prospectus to provide financing flexibility over the next 25 months. The firm plans to use various funding strategies, including at-the-market equity offerings, convertible financings, asset divestitures, Bitcoin-backed credit facilities, and strategic acquisitions or partnerships. Volcon Raises $500 Million To Fund Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Volcon Inc. has entered into a securities purchase agreement for a private placement expected to generate over $500 million in gross proceeds. The firm will issue 50,142,851 shares of its common stock at $10 per share to accredited and institutional investors. The company stated that it plans to use 95% of the gross proceeds to acquire Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. Empery Asset Management was the lead investor in the offering. Other participants included crypto venture capital firms like FalconX, Pantera, RK Capital, Borderless, and Relayer Capital. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) registered a sharp decline during the ongoing session, falling to a low of $117,389 as selling pressure intensified. However, the flagship cryptocurrency has rebounded to reclaim $118,000 and move to its current level of $118,777. While much of Bitcoin’s latest rally has been fueled by institutional demand, new data suggests that retail investors are stepping back in after an extended pause. According to a report by Glassnode, Bitcoin held by first-time buyers rose nearly 3% over the past two weeks, rising from 4.77 million BTC to 4.91 million BTC , indicating that fresh capital is entering the market. “Over the past two weeks, the supply held by first-time BTC buyers rose by +2.86%, climbing from 4.77M to 4.91M BTC . Fresh capital continues to enter the market, supporting the latest price breakout.” In previous bullish cycles, the rally was generally fueled by retail investors. However, the current cycle was marked by institutional and ETF demand, which helped Bitcoin surge past key levels as smaller investors remained on the sidelines. Glassnode’s report suggests retail investors may be re-entering the market. An analysis of trading activity on Binance shows a jump in retail-sized deposits while whale inflows registered a notable decline. This means a significant portion of recent momentum is being driven by retail activity. CryptoQuant analysts have also stated that the Bitcoin market is not overheated, and that the flagship cryptocurrency has room to push higher. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler Jr. believes BTC is yet to hit its peak, sharing a chart showing the absence of a peak signal, typically occurring around major market tops. Adler stated, “It appears when the combined normalized market to realized price index and 30-day/365-day value days destroyed ratio score reaches or exceeds 1. The Peak Signal only appears at major market tops, and it hasn’t shown up this time, suggesting we’re not at a peak yet.” Crypto Dan, another CryptoQuant analyst, highlighted the realized Cap-UTXO Age Bands, a m",bitzo,https://bitzo.com/2025/07/bitcoin-price-analysis-btc-dips-below-118000-as-selling-pressure-returns,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|REGULATION,Breaking News|Bitcoin,BTC,"Bitcoin Price Analysis: BTC Dips Below $118,000 As Selling Pressure Returns.

2025-07-17 16:00:22+00:00,Altcoins Reclaim Key Technical Level – Can Momentum Sustain This Time?,"Altcoins are flashing fresh bullish signals as momentum returns to the broader crypto market. Leading the charge is Ethereum, which has surged above the $3,450 level, marking its highest price since mid-January. The breakout signals growing confidence among bulls and is sparking renewed interest across the altcoin sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds – $0–$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive Many altcoins have posted impressive gains in recent days, bouncing sharply from their April lows. The recovery is not just isolated to top names like ETH and SOL; mid- and small-cap tokens are also showing signs of strength, supported by increasing volume and improved market structure. A key technical development is adding weight to the bullish case: the altcoin market has once again pushed above a key daily moving average. This historically significant level often marks the transition from downtrends to sustained uptrends. Altcoins Reclaim 200-Day Moving Average Altcoins are showing renewed strength, and according to top analyst On-Chain Mind, the technical landscape is beginning to shift in their favor. In a recent chart shared on X, he highlighted that the altcoin market has once again broken above its 200-day moving average, a level that historically separates bearish phases from sustained uptrends. However, On-Chain Mind cautioned that this development has occurred multiple times during this market cycle, often followed by weeks of sideways chop and volatility rather than immediate upside. Still, this time may be different. With Ethereum rallying above $3,400—its highest level since mid-January—and Bitcoin consolidating above key support zones, conditions appear more favorable for a broader altcoin breakout. What makes this moment particularly important is the price structure across many altcoins, which has turned decisively bullish after months—and in some cases, years—of deep consolidation.

Altcoins are flashing fresh bullish signals as momentum returns to the broader crypto market. Leading the charge is Ethereum, which has surged above the $3,450 level, marking its highest price since mid-January. The breakout signals growing confidence among bulls and is sparking renewed interest across the altcoin sector.

The recovery is not just isolated to top names like ETH and SOL; mid- and small-cap tokens are also showing signs of strength, supported by increasing volume and improved market structure. A key technical development is adding weight to the bullish case: the altcoin market has once again pushed above a key daily moving average. This historically significant level often marks the transition from downtrends to sustained uptrends. Altcoins Reclaim 200-Day Moving Average Altcoins are showing renewed strength, and according to top analyst On-Chain Mind, the technical landscape is beginning to shift in their favor. In a recent chart shared on X, he highlighted that the altcoin market has once again broken above its 200-day moving average, a level that historically separates bearish phases from sustained uptrends. However, On-Chain Mind cautioned that this development has occurred multiple times during this market cycle, often followed by weeks of sideways chop and volatility rather than immediate upside.

2025-07-17 16:05:00+00:00,Tether’s $3 Billion USDT Mint Raises Questions Amid Stablecoin Law Passage,"Tether, a major player in the crypto space, has created $3 billion worth of popular stablecoin USDT within a single day. This significant and sudden increase in supply comes at a time when the United States is moving closer to introducing new rules for stablecoins. These rules, under the proposed GENIUS Act, may change how stablecoins operate in the country. As a result, market attention could shift toward regulated alternatives such as Ripple’s RLUSD. Tether Increases Supply As GENIUS Act Sets New Standards Blockchain tracking platform Lookonchain revealed that Tether minted another $1 billion worth of USDT. This brings the total stablecoin minted on July 17 to $3 billion. Market experts suggest that this move aims to boost liquidity and support the recent price movements of Bitcoin (BTC). This move comes shortly after the GENIUS Act passed a procedural vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. The proposed law seeks to set federal standards to ensure stability and transparency in the market. If signed into law, the bill would require stablecoin issuers to follow strict federal guidelines. Crypto firms will be required to hold only cash or secure, short-term assets and secure formal licenses to operate. They must also publish financial records that have been independently audited. Tether May Face Regulatory Pressure Under New U.S. Law These proposed rules could pose a significant challenge for Tether, which currently controls over 66% of the global stablecoin market. Unlike complete audits, Tether only provides attestations, and its reserves include Bitcoin and precious metals. Meanwhile, in the past, the company has been criticized for its unclear reserve practices . Under the GENIUS Act, this might not be enough to continue operating legally in the U.S. On the bright side, the law does offer some breathing room. The Senate version gives a three-year grace period, while the House version offers 18 months. This gives Tether time to either adjust its reserve structure or consider launching a new, U.S.-compliant version of its stablecoin. Ripple and Circle May Gain from New Regulation Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD , appears ready to follow the new rules. Ripple has applied for a national trust bank charter and a Federal Reserve master account. It also announced that BNY Mellon will serve as the official custodian of RLUSD reserves, which the U.S. Treasury backs. These steps show that RLUSD is designed to meet the legal requirements outlined in the GENIUS Act. If the act becomes law, RLUSD may be among the first stablecoins entirely accepted under U.S. regulation. This may lead to a large shift of funds away from USDT and into compliant alternatives. Circle, the company behind USDC, is another possible beneficiary. Following news of the bill’s progress, Circle’s stock rose by 34%, reflecting investor confidence in stablecoins that adhere to government regulations.

Companies are announcing multi-million dollar moves one after another, with the latest announcement coming from Bit Origin. Nasdaq-listed company Bit Origin has announced that it will raise $500 million and create a large treasury of Dogecoin (DOGE). According to the official statement, Bit Origin announced that it plans to raise $500 million, including $400 million in equity and $100 million in convertible debt, to accumulate Dogecoin as a core asset. The company has already raised $15 million and plans to use a significant portion of the proceeds for its first Dogecoin purchase. The company aims to become one of the largest public Dogecoin holders by showcasing the benefits of DOGE, its low fees, and its strong community. “Bit Origin aims to become one of the largest publicly traded Dogecoin holders. The strategy aims to create long-term value by increasing Doge per share.” Bit Origin CEO and President Jinghai Jiang said: “Bit Origin goes beyond mining infrastructure to directly participate in the value and utility of digital assets.

2025-07-17 16:09:23+00:00,LetsBonk.fun Tops Ethereum in 24h Revenue as Trading Volume and $SNORT Surge,"What on earth is happening in meme coin land right now? In an explosive twist no one saw coming, Bonk.fun, also known as LetsBonkFun, just dethroned Ethereum-based launchpads in 24-hour revenue, sending shockwaves through the memecoin world. The platform not only outpaced Solana-based competitors but also pulled ahead of Ethereum itself, a staggering feat that has traders scrambling. But it’s not just Bonk.fun that’s ripping, $SNORT, the cheeky crypto aardvark token born on the platform, is riding this momentum with a jaw-dropping surge in volume and price. With memecoin energy back at full blast and degen capital flooding into launchpads, the question isn’t just who’s next – it’s how far can this madness go? That’s just for a day. But for the week, bonk.fun beat out pump.fun and Raydium among launchpads. It also casually bested Solana’s weekly revenue ($8.25M to $967K). The moves sent ripples through $BONK’s market performance, boosting the impact of meme coin launchpads while also sending $BONK skywards. As letsbonk.fun surges and $BONK climbs, other meme coin projects look ready to rock. Record-Breaking Revenue & Market Dominance According to SolanaFloor, letsbonk.fun outstripped Ethereum’s 24-hour revenue, a milestone validated by DefiLlama figures showing revenues of $1.04M, nearly double Pump.fun’s $533K.. Over the week of July 7–13, bonk.fun earned roughly $8.19 M, compared to Pump.fun’s $3.1 M. Livestream data reveals that 19,000 memecoins were launched in 24 hours via letsbonk.fun vs 9,200 via pump.fun, capturing 58% market share. Bonk.fun appears to be amplifying momentum, not just riding an existing meme coin wave. 50% of launchpad fees are directed toward BONK buybacks, reinforcing demand and supporting token value. $BONK has accordingly surged 70% since April, trading around $0.000037. Bonk.fun, Powered by Solana Bonk.fun is benefiting from a rejuvenated Solana ecosystem. Solana launchpads raised $52.6M in revenue in the past 30 days, while $SOL itself trades at $174, up 12% in the past week. Yet with high velocity comes high risk. Many meme coins launched via these platforms collapse mere days post-launch. Others surge 1000s of percent before falling back to earth. That’s in part because of the frenetic nature of Solana meme coin trading and the broader meme coin sector. But that crazy energy is part of what makes memes so potentially profitable and also explains why the sector is up in recent days. Part of that increase is due to pump.fun, the former king of Solana meme coins, and the long-awaited $PUMP token launch. $PUMP briefly crested $2B market cap, before its price fell 14% to a $1.85B market cap. In the meantime, $BONK is up 2.6% daily – and a whopping 56% over the past week. So which meme tokens are next to go to the moon? With the craziness of the Solana ecosystem, even experienced traders need next-level tools. That’s where the Snorter Bot comes in. Snorter Token ($SNORT) – Sniff Out the Next $BONK with the Snorter Bot Dodge Scams. Snipe Gems. Trade Like a Pro — Automatically with $SNORT Say goodbye to rugpulls and honeypots.

2025-07-17 16:09:50+00:00,Bitcoin DeFi TVL Surges from $307 Million to $6.4 Billion in Just 18 Months,"Bitcoin decentralized finance ( DeFi ) has seen a massive 1,971.7% rise in total value locked (TVL) over just a year and a half, according to the latest report by Arch Network . Per the report, Bitcoin DeFi has recorded a massive TVL surge over an 18-month period between January 2024 and July 2025. More precisely, it increased from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.5 billion by December 2024. It then settled at $6.36 billion as of early July 2025. At the time of writing, TVL stands at $7.049 billion. This would mark a whopping 2,196% rise since the December 2024 amount. Source: DeFiLlama The report noted that the surge was fueled by several key factors. These include protocol launches, novel token standards, growing institutional inflows, a rally pushing BTC to an all-time high, and the rise of liquid restaking. Moreover, Ethereum has been the undisputed DeFi leader for years now, thanks to smart contracts and a strong developer ecosystem. Yet, “the narrative is evolving,” Arch Network claims. “A new wave of builders is bringing DeFi to Bitcoin.” These developers are attracted by Bitcoin’s security, untapped liquidity, institutional interest, and increasing user demand for composable financial tools. Furthermore, Layer 1 innovations and protocols are unlocking Bitcoin’s native programmability. “Many view Bitcoin as the next DeFi frontier, set to even outpace Ethereum,” it claims. “As this momentum grows, Bitcoin’s role as a foundational layer for DeFi is becoming increasingly undeniable.” According to Arch Network CEO and co-founder, Matt Mudano, “Bitcoin’s true potential lies beyond being a passive store of value. As a $2 trillion asset, unlocking its liquidity to build a truly open and permissionless financial system on its base layer is the next frontier. Bitcoin DeFi is the greatest opportunity not only for crypto, but for financial innovation as a whole.” You may also like: Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch, on Bitcoin Momentum, Programmability on Bitcoin, and the Future of Bitcoin DeFi | Ep. 443 Curve DAO’s native token $CRV rebounded this week, with about a 79% rally as it climbed from a weekly low of $0.6017 and is trading at $0.9882 at press time, also marking a 22.9% increase in the last 24 hours.Despite occasional profit‑taking around mid‑week, $CRV’s renewed momentum indicates robust buying interest ahead of key governance votes and protocol upgrades.On-chain analytics show $CRV trading volume has surged to $848.37 million in the last 24 hours, indicating heightened... 36% of Respondents Keep BTC in Cold Storage, Favoring Self-Custody Over Yield and Bitcoin DeFi Among many findings in the report, Arch noted that 36% of respondents hold BTC in cold storage. 33% trade on CEXs, and 31% use it for payments. Also, 29% use BTC as DeFi collateral, 22% for bridging, 20% in Bitcoin-native DeFi, and 28% as liquidity provision. 7% aren’t actively using their coins. Moreover, among those who don’t use BTC in DeFi, 36% cited lack of trust, and 25% said risk and fear of loss. Other reasons include technical barriers (poor tooling and low liquidity), UX, and regulation. Also, 16% simply prefer to HODL. The same amount waits for better infrastructure. “Only 11% don’t see clear benefits, suggesting that most concerns can be addressed rather than indicating a lack of interest in leveraging Bitcoin more actively,” the report argues. Meanwhile, among those who use Bitcoin DeFi, there are both veterans and newcomers, the researchers found. The majority of respondents are in Asia (61%) and Africa (17%). Source: Arch Network 55% of respondents are involved in lending and borrowing protocols, while 51% are in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and 40% in stablecoins. Most builders (44%) chose Bitcoin DeFi for its security and decentralization, and 27% are in it for growing liquidity and ecosystem expansion. Other reasons include Bitcoin’s long-term vision and community (26%), the opportunity for Layer 2 innovation (20%), ecosystem growth (17%), censorship resistance (12%), and privacy (8%). However, despite its advantages, Bitcoin wasn’t built for complex smart contracts, the report notes. For 43% of the respondents, this is the main challenge. Lack of developer tools (22), poor documentation (15%), low composability (16%), and liquidity (12%) are other reasons. These show “that Bitcoin DeFi is still early.” As solutions to many of these issues, respondents named better infrastructure (45%) and broader L2 adoption (43%). Many developers also work on Ethereum (63%), Solana (47%), and Base (44%), with 60% preferring other chains for smart contract flexibility and 33% for developer tools. That said, 49% of responding developers working on other chains plan to switch fully to Bitcoin. 39% will stay multichain, and 12% haven’t decided yet.

More precisely, it increased from $307 million in January 2024 to $6.5 billion by December 2024. It then settled at $6.36 billion as of early July 2025. At the time of writing, TVL stands at $7.049 billion. This would mark a whopping 2,196% rise since the December 2024 amount. Source: DeFiLlama The report noted that the surge was fueled by several key factors. These include protocol launches, novel token standards, growing institutional inflows, a rally pushing BTC to an all-time high, and the rise of liquid restaking. Moreover, Ethereum has been the undisputed DeFi leader for years now, thanks to smart contracts and a strong developer ecosystem. Yet, “the narrative is evolving,” Arch Network claims. “A new wave of builders is bringing DeFi to Bitcoin.” These developers are attracted by Bitcoin’s security, untapped liquidity, institutional interest, and increasing user demand for composable financial tools. Furthermore, Layer 1 innovations and protocols are unlocking Bitcoin’s native programmability. “Many view Bitcoin as the next DeFi frontier, set to even outpace Ethereum,” it claims. “As this momentum grows, Bitcoin’s role as a foundational layer for DeFi is becoming increasingly undeniable.” According to Arch Network CEO and co-founder, Matt Mudano, “Bitcoin’s true potential lies beyond being a passive store of value. As a $2 trillion asset, unlocking its liquidity to build a truly open and permissionless financial system on its base layer is the next frontier. Bitcoin DeFi is the greatest opportunity not only for crypto, but for financial innovation as a whole.” You may also like: Matt Mudano, CEO of Arch, on Bitcoin Momentum, Programmability on Bitcoin, and the Future of Bitcoin DeFi | Ep. 443 Curve DAO’s native token $CRV rebounded this week, with about a 79% rally as it climbed from a weekly low of $0.6017 and is trading at $0.9882 at press time, also marking a 22.9% increase in the last 24 hours.Despite occasional profit‑taking around mid‑week, $CRV’s renewed momentum indicates robust buying interest ahead of key governance votes and protocol upgrades.On-chain analytics show $CRV trading volume has surged to $848.37 million in the last 24 hours, indicating heightened... 36% of Respondents Keep BTC in Cold Storage, Favoring Self-Custody Over Yield and Bitcoin DeFi Among many findings in the report, Arch noted that 36% of respondents hold BTC in cold storage. 33% trade on CEXs, and 31% use it for payments. Also, 29% use BTC as DeFi collateral, 22% for bridging, 20% in Bitcoin-native DeFi, and 28% as liquidity provision. 7% aren’t actively using their coins. Moreover, among those who don’t use BTC in DeFi, 36% cited lack of trust, and 25% said risk and fear of loss. Other reasons include technical barriers (poor tooling and low liquidity), UX, and regulation. Also, 16% simply prefer to HODL. The same amount waits for better infrastructure. “Only 11% don’t see clear benefits, suggesting that most concerns can be addressed rather than indicating a lack of interest in leveraging Bitcoin more actively,” the report argues. Meanwhile, among those who use Bitcoin DeFi, there are both veterans and newcomers, the researchers found. The majority of respondents are in Asia (61%) and Africa (17%). Source: Arch Network 55% of respondents are involved in lending and borrowing protocols, while 51% are in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and 40% in stablecoins. Most builders (44%) chose Bitcoin DeFi for its security and decentralization, and 27% are in it for growing liquidity and ecosystem expansion. Other reasons include Bitcoin’s long-term vision and community (26%), the opportunity for Layer 2 innovation (20%), ecosystem growth (17%), censorship resistance (12%), and privacy (8%). However, despite its advantages, Bitcoin wasn’t built for complex smart contracts, the report notes. For 43% of the respondents, this is the main challenge. Lack of developer tools (22), poor documentation (15%), low composability (16%), and liquidity (12%) are other reasons. These show “that Bitcoin DeFi is still early.” As solutions to many of these issues, respondents named better infrastructure (45%) and broader L2 adoption (43%). Many developers also work on Ethereum (63%), Solana (47%), and Base (44%), with 60% preferring other chains for smart contract flexibility and 33% for developer tools. That said, 49% of responding developers working on other chains plan to switch fully to Bitcoin. 39% will stay multichain, and 12% haven’t decided yet.

2025-07-17 16:24:58+00:00,RGB protocol goes live on Bitcoin unlocking native support for stablecoins,"RGB protocol, a smart contract and asset issuance protocol for Bitcoin, has officially launched on the Bitcoin mainnet. On July 17, RGB protocol announced that it had been successfully deployed on Bitcoin, unlocking new functionalities such as token creation, asset transfers, and programmable contracts within the Bitcoin and Lightning Network ecosystems. The latest release, version 0.11.1, marks a major milestone for developers and users that want to issue and manage digital assets on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network without relying on external blockchains. According to the project team, RGB enables users to create and manage stablecoins, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), community tokens, and other digital assets directly on Bitcoin. Users can send and receive these assets over Bitcoin or Lightning, all while keeping control, privacy, and decentralization intact. RGB uses client-side validation, meaning all asset data stays off-chain and doesn’t touch Bitcoin’s core consensus. This approach helps scale asset issuance on Bitcoin without compromising user privacy. However, asset proofs still get anchored to Bitcoin transactions, keeping them permanent without putting extra load on the blockchain itself. The protocol does not depend on trusted intermediaries such as federations, validators, or centralized coordinators. All validation is done locally by the user, reducing reliance on third parties and minimizing network-level risks. RGB has been positioned as a Bitcoin-native alternative to asset issuance platforms built on other chains, the project’s team told crypto media. USDT to be launched on Bitcoin As part of its early adoption plans, RGB will support the deployment of Tether’s USDT stablecoin on the Bitcoin network. Viktor Ihnatiuk, founder of Boosty Labs, one of the core development firms behind RGB and a founding member of the RGB Protocol Association, confirmed that USDT will serve as the first real-world use case of RGB’s confidential and scalable asset transfers. Once USDT is launched through RGB, users will be able to send and receive the stablecoin over the Lightning Network with low fees and fast confirmation times. Ihnatiuk said this would remove the need for using separate blockchains that often involve trade-offs in trust and decentralization. Ihnatiuk also noted that several existing RGB-based projects are preparing to integrate Tether once the asset becomes available on the protocol. Further, he added that RGB’s infrastructure supports Lightning-based atomic swaps, allowing for decentralized trading between different assets without any intermediaries. On top of that, the RGB protocol includes a virtual machine that developers can use to build DeFi applications and smart contract logic similar to what is available on Ethereum or Solana. This means, like Ethereum, developers would be able to create decentralized applications within the Bitcoin ecosystem, leveraging its security while expanding functionality. To support ongoing development and adoption, a group of industry stakeholders has established the RGB Protocol Association. It plans to drive development, support education, and back community projects with grants and sponsorships. The association’s founding members include Bitfinex, Boosty Labs, Fulgur Ventures, Plan B Network, Kaleidoswap, ThunderStack, LNFI, Bitmask (by Diba), and Tribe RGB. RGB’s launch is part of a growing push to expand what Bitcoin can do.

2025-07-17 17:00:02+00:00,"Did The US Government Dump 170,000 BTC? Marshals Reveal Shocking Bitcoin Holdings","A rumor is rapidly spreading among crypto investors that the US government may have quietly sold off nearly 170,000 BTC, leaving a fraction of its assumed holdings intact. The speculation began after the US Marshals Service, in response to a FOIA request, revealed that it currently holds only 28,988 BTC valued at approximately $3.4 billion. Many crypto investors took this disclosure to mean that the federal government’s total Bitcoin reserves had declined from the long-assumed figure of around 200,000 BTC. The claim was amplified across the social media platform X, where even some public figures reacted to what appears to be a massive strategic sell-off by the US government. FOIA Request Misinterpreted The confusion of the US government selling the majority of its Bitcoin holdings appears to stem from misinterpretations of the specific holdings of the US Marshals Service with those of the entire federal government. The FOIA request that sparked the debate was submitted by journalist L0la L33tz, and it accurately reflects that the Marshals control just under 29,000 BTC. However, this only accounts for the Bitcoin under the custody of that particular agency. Related Reading: This Analyst Predicted Bitcoin’s Rally To $120,000 Months Ago, Here’s The Rest Of The Forecast On-chain data from blockchain analytics firm Arkham Intelligence provides a very different picture. According to Arkham, the US government as a whole still holds approximately 198,000 BTC, worth over $23.46 billion at the current price of Bitcoin. These coins are distributed across various federal agencies and are not limited to the Marshals’ holdings. Nevertheless, the misrepresentation took hold quickly. Even US Senator Cynthia Lummis, who is a well-known advocate of Bitcoin, responded to the rumor, saying, “I’m alarmed by reports that the U.S. has sold off over 80% of its Bitcoin reserves, leaving just ~29,000 coins. If true, this is a total strategic blunder and sets the United States back years in the bitcoin race.” What If the US Quietly Sold 170,000 BTC? The repercussions on the broader crypto market would be immense if the US government had indeed sold off 170,000 BTC in secret. A sale of that scale would unleash massive selling pressure and cause a strong drop in the price of Bitcoin. This would erode confidence among investors in the wider crypto market and set off a chain reaction of liquidations across other cryptocurrencies. Such a move would not only cause technical breakdowns in price structure but also cancel out the possibility of governments around the world holding crypto as a form of strategic reserve. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Just Got Rejected From TSDT Resistance That Triggered Last Altcoin Season — Details Moreover, such a dump would directly contradict the federal policy direction set earlier this year. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing all federal agencies to transfer their Bitcoin and digital asset holdings to the US Treasury. The order formalized the creation of a Bitcoin reserve, which was meant to recognize the cryptocurrency as a national asset. In light of that policy, the notion that the US would quietly sell off the majority of its Bitcoin holdings seems highly improbable under the current Trump administration.

Such a move would not only cause technical breakdowns in price structure but also cancel out the possibility of governments around the world holding crypto as a form of strategic reserve.

In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order instructing all federal agencies to transfer their Bitcoin and digital asset holdings to the US Treasury. The order formalized the creation of a Bitcoin reserve, which was meant to recognize the cryptocurrency as a national asset. In light of that policy, the notion that the US would quietly sell off the majority of its Bitcoin holdings seems highly improbable under the current Trump administration. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,360. Featured image from Pixabay, chart from Tradingview.com"

The surge came as a wave of capital flowed into spot exchange-traded funds tied to the crypto. Nine ETH ETFs saw their largest-ever daily net inflow, totaling $726.74 million, with BlackRock’s ETHA ETF alone pulling in $499 million. This spike in ETF interest comes as part of a larger July trend. So far this month, ETH funds have attracted $2.27 billion in net inflows, the highest monthly figure since these investment vehicles launched in July 2024. This is straight-up institutional firepower. Eight of the nine funds logged positive flows for the day. Institutions stack Ether and treat it like gold Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, said Ethereum is no longer being treated like a trading token. “Ethereum is increasingly being seen as a long-term institutional asset, not just a trading vehicle,” Rachael said. She pointed out that the ETFs now hold about 4% of Ethereum’s total market cap, a number that spells just how much capital is pouring in. She didn’t stop there. “Combine that with more than US$2.5B in daily trading volume, bullish chart setups, and capital rotation out of bitcoin, and you’ve got a breakout that’s being driven by both fundamentals and sentiment,” Rachael added. The second-largest crypto is also being stockpiled on-chain. SharpLink Gaming, which is backed by Consensys, has now overtaken the Ethereum Foundation as the largest known ETH holder. As of July 15, it controls 280,706 ETH, and it added another 20,279 ETH on Wednesday. The data was confirmed by Arkham. This is an entity moving tens of millions of dollars in ETH like it’s a normal Wednesday. Gamesquare pours over $90 million into Ethereum Elsewhere, GameSquare Holdings priced a major underwritten public offering of 46,666,667 shares at $1.50 each, raising $70 million in gross proceeds before costs. The company said it plans to use the bulk of this raise to expand its Ethereum position. That’s built into the company’s roadmap through its alliance with Dialectic, a crypto-focused capital management and yield firm. Justin Kenna, GameSquare’s CEO, made it clear. “This raise marks a pivotal milestone for GameSquare. It enables us to move with speed and scale to continue to build what we believe is one of the most ambitious Ethereum treasury strategies in the public markets. Our goal is to transform a traditional treasury function into a high-performance business vertical generating durable, recurring cash flows.” The deal includes a 15% overallotment option, which, if exercised, would increase the total raise to $80.5 million. That comes on top of another $9.2 million raised just last week. If you’re counting, that’s more than $90 million in total gross proceeds aimed directly at Ethereum. Justin said the company is targeting ETH deployments across Dialectic-engineered strategies that have historically produced 8–14% on-chain yields. He explained, “We believe this approach, combined with staking income and potential ETH appreciation, has the potential to deliver millions in annual incremental revenue. That cash flow can fund further ETH purchases and support broader growth initiatives across our platform.” He ended the statement by saying the company is staying fully committed to its Ethereum strategy and is focused on building long-term value for shareholders.

2025-07-17 17:16:53+00:00,Bitwise Bitcoin ETF: Bull Market Still Running On One Engine,"Summary Institutional flows via spot Bitcoin ETFs are driving the current Bitcoin market rally, with BITB and others seeing sustained inflows despite recent price consolidation. Retail participation remains muted, as seen in declining spot exchange volumes and high Bitcoin dominance, suggesting we’re still early in the bull cycle. BITB offers asymmetric upside, providing direct exposure to Bitcoin’s spot price with institutional tailwinds now and retail momentum still to come. It''s been ~18 months since the spot Bitcoin ETFs began trading, and at this juncture, most investors have moved beyond the granular details in their preference for a specific ETF to gain direct exposure to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ). The ETFs all offer similar structure and tracking accuracy, save for Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), which has maintained a higher 1.5% expense ratio. We''re also now past the early marketing incentives, like the six-month fee waiver on some of the ETFs. Personally, I favor the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (NYSEARCA: BITB ) as my preferred vehicle because of the fund’s alignment with the broader Bitcoin development ethos; they donate 10% of their profits to open-source Bitcoin development. Bitwise was also the first fund manager to publish the Bitcoin addresses for its ETF holdings. Investors can track the inflows and outflows of the actual BTC in the fund in real-time, using the addresses. This week, Bitwise retired the approach of verifying the ETF''s BTC holdings via the published addresses and has introduced a more robust and institutional-grade framework for verifying the fund’s on-chain reserves and financial integrity through a third-party proof-of-reserves system, verified daily by a U.S.-based licensed CPA firm. Instead of just listing on-chain BTC holdings, this new verification method reconciles on-chain holdings with the ETFs'' outstanding shares and will soon include CPA-attested reports that verify both assets and liabilities, thereby delivering a more comprehensive and investor-friendly form of transparency. Think of this in a similar vein to the independent audit performed on companies prior to a 10-Q or 10-K filing, but the scope here is limited to on-chain digital asset balances and ETF share liabilities. And the verification happens daily. With the latest updates on BITB and their proof-of-reserves verification already mentioned, the truth is, there’s not much left to say about the structure of spot Bitcoin ETFs themselves that hasn''t already been covered by analysts here on Seeking Alpha. The products are now largely standardized - same underlying asset, similar tracking, fees narrowing, and with early incentives fading. I believe the questions now on most investors'' minds would be whether Bitcoin''s momentum sustains, navigating macro headwinds and their potential impact on Bitcoin and its related assets, and the profit-taking strategies at BTC''s all-time highs. For most investors, it is now much less about which specific spot Bitcoin ETF to choose and more about how the underlying asset performs and how to position to maximize returns. BITB vs BTC price trend on a YTD basis (Seeking Alpha) With the spot Bitcoin ETFs'' underlying asset, Bitcoin, showing momentum lately, the ETFs have naturally followed the price action of Bitcoin. The spot Bitcoin ETFs themselves have been an immense catalyst that has made Bitcoin more mainstream this past year, and recently broke a new all-time high just above $121,000 . Since the April Liberation Day tariffs sell-offs when BTC dipped below $80,000, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have added over $6 billion in inflows. The spot ETFs now hold a total of ~1.28 million BTC or about 6% of Bitcoin’s total 21 million supply, bringing total assets under management [AuM] for the total ETFs to a staggering $154 billion (as of July 17, 2025). Since the launch of the spot ETFs, Bitcoin has seen accelerated comebacks after every price dip. Every dip has been followed by an uptrend that breaks the previous all-time high; basically, higher highs and higher lows. TheBlock The interest in the spot Bitcoin ETFs has been increasingly institutional - the trade volumes of the spot Bitcoin ETFs and the increasing adoption of Bitcoin treasury strategy among publicly-traded companies prove this institutional interest. The cumulative trade volume since the spot Bitcoin ETF launched now surpasses $1 trillion (shown in the preceding chart). And for the first half of this year, spot Bitcoin ETFs nearly matched about 40% of the net inflows into physically backed gold ETFs. Which is impressive, considering the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched less than two years ago. Physically-backed gold ETFs recorded $38 billion in inflows in H1, while the physically-backed Bitcoin ETFs (ditto the spot Bitcoin ETFs) have seen $14.83 billion in net inflows so far this year, already flipping its own 2024’s net inflows (see the chart below).

According to Arkham Intelligence data, the value of Bitcoins in wallets thought to belong to Nakamoto has surpassed that of Microsoft founder Bill Gates ($117 billion) and Dell Technologies founder Michael Dell ($126.5 billion), with the BTC price increasing by 14 percent in the last month. Calculated at Bitcoin''s current price of $118,912, this wealth puts Satoshi just $12 billion behind Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, who has long been known for his critical stance against Bitcoin.

While the exact amount of Bitcoin owned by Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown, a widely accepted analysis is known as the “Patoshi Pattern.” The consistent activity of a single miner observed in early Bitcoin blocks suggests that Satoshi mined approximately 22,000 blocks.

This has fueled speculation of an impending multi-billion-dollar sell-off. According to on-chain analyst Lookonchain, nearly half of the whale’s 80,000 BTC (worth over $4.7 billion at current prices) was moved into new wallets recently. The abrupt action has spooked traders, especially with Bitcoin’s recent price strength above $123,000. $4.7B in BTC Transferred Between Wallets The whale began transferring with a 9,000 BTC transaction—approximately $1.06 billion—to wallets linked with Galaxy Digital. Shortly after, 7,823 BTC (around $927 million) was sent next. Then the mass migration occurred: 40,009 BTC—worth $4.68 billion—was dispersed into new wallet addresses. Though some analysts theorize the activity may represent internal restructurings or security precautions, the destinations suggest another possibility. Hints of a Potential Sell-Off? The transfers to Galaxy Digital were just the beginning. On-chain metrics show the firm moved 6,000 BTC ($706 million) to major exchanges like Binance and Bybit—a strong indication that some of the coins may be about to hit the market. Whales sell at tops, and with Bitcoin changing hands for approximately $118,200, traders are on high alert.

Pakistan plans a national Bitcoin reserve and regulatory body for oversight. El Salvador maintains active Bitcoin purchases under an IMF deal. Pakistan and El Salvador have initiated formal diplomatic ties centered on cryptocurrency cooperation, according to a report published by Bloomberg . The partnership follows a meeting in San Salvador between Bilal Bin Saqib, special assistant to Pakistan’s prime minister on crypto and blockchain, and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele. Pakistan and El Salvador Partner for Digital Assets The discussions focused on knowledge-sharing in digital asset infrastructure and policy, while Pakistan plans to structure its crypto markets under regulatory oversight. Pakistan recently allocated 2,000 megawatts for Bitcoin mining and intends to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. The government previously launched the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) to oversee the domestic digital asset market. Pakistan creates digital assets regulator PVARA to oversee crypto industry with @cz_binance and @saylor as strategic advisors amid massive 40M users and $300B annual trading volume. #Pakistan #Crypto https://t.co/sGm3VPdu1M — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 8, 2025 Earlier this year, Saqib stated that up to 20 million Pakistanis currently hold crypto, despite ongoing caution from the country’s central bank. El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021 and continues to acquire the asset while under an International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement. According to government figures, the country holds 6,238 Bitcoins. Tether also opened a headquarters there in January. Bitcoin Acquisition vs IMF Agreement Pakistan is currently under a $7 billion IMF program that runs through 2027. The fund has expressed concerns about state-level digital asset purchases, but El Salvador has continued its policy regardless of the terms. “Bitcoin keeps being an important project,” said El Salvador’s economy minister , Maria Luisa Hayem, when the government purchased seven Bitcoins despite the agreement with the IMF. “There is an asset accumulation that we’re seeing from the government perspective, from the private sector perspective.” By forming bilateral channels focused on infrastructure and governance, countries under IMF influence may seek greater autonomy in structuring digital asset policies without triggering compliance issues or threatening macroeconomic stability. Other emerging economies with large unbanked populations are also exploring sovereign digital asset programs, seeking to reduce reliance on foreign exchange reserves and expand financial access without altering core monetary frameworks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Could this agreement lead to joint mining or shared infrastructure between Pakistan and El Salvador? While not disclosed in current statements, both countries are actively investing in Bitcoin mining. Future collaboration could include technology transfer, operational partnerships, or coordinated infrastructure planning if aligned under bilateral frameworks. How does Pakistan’s crypto stance compare with other IMF program countries? Most IMF-supported nations have either restricted or delayed digital asset integration. Pakistan’s move to create a national reserve and regulatory authority places it ahead in formal crypto adoption among peers under similar fiscal supervision. What challenges might Pakistan face in implementing a national Bitcoin reserve? Potential obstacles include central bank resistance, volatility management, custodial infrastructure, and compliance with existing IMF conditions.

The project closely mirrors the goals of the Department of Government Agency (D.O.G.E.) , a government-focused body founded by Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla. Ripple Forms Alliance That Mirrors Musk’s D.O.G.E. A new X social media post by crypto journalist Eleanor Terrett confirms that California has officially partnered with Ripple and other leading crypto and tech firms, possibly replicating Musk’s D.O.G.E. initiative. The new task force aims to transform public services through blockchain and Web3 innovation. Governor Newsom announced the launch of the California Breakthrough Project in a press release on July 15. The newly formed task force held its inaugural meeting on June 6 at Ripple’s San Francisco headquarters, bringing together top figures from major tech companies like AME Cloud Ventures, Instacart, Snapchat, Moonpay , Anduril, and more. Others included former Tesla CFO Jason Wheeler and angel investor Ron Conway etc. The similarities between the California Breakthrough Project and Musk’s D.O.G.E. are evident in their shared emphasis on speed, experimentation, and cross-sector problem-solving. However, while D.O.G.E. leaned heavily into rapid implementation and market-style disruption, the California Breakthrough Project seemingly prioritizes ethics, transparency, and civil engagement to avoid public backlash. This balancing act could determine the newly launched project’s long-term viability as it pushes the boundaries of how blockchain and digital assets like XRP might one day integrate with government functions. Ripple’s involvement also reflects its growing influence in institutional and governmental environments. Moreover, with California being one of the largest economies in the world and a supporter of digital currencies , this collaboration with various crypto and tech companies could mark a significant step toward reshaping public perception of cryptocurrencies in a more favorable light. California Taps Crypto And Tech To Modernize Government According to reports, Governor Newsom launched the California Breakthrough Project to integrate input from the state’s leading crypto and tech companies, aiming to overhaul governmental operations from the ground up. The objectives of the project include diagnosing efficiencies in public service delivery and applying emerging technologies like blockchain to improve transparency, responsiveness, and inter-agency collaboration. The overarching strategy involves encouraging tech-led solutions for systemic government problems—a concept similar to the one behind D.O.G.E. By aligning firms that specialize in blockchain, payments, and digital infrastructure, California may not only invest in its technological advancement but also potentially lay the groundwork for the real-time application of Web3 innovation in public systems.

2025-07-17 18:06:08+00:00,Alteri Launches $30M Tokenized Bitcoin Mining Infrastructure Fund on Chintai Nexus’ Compliant Blockchain,"Singapore, Singapore, July 17th, 2025, Alteri is proud to announce the launch of a $30 million tokenized Bitcoin mining infrastructure fund through Chintai Nexus ’ compliant blockchain, providing accredited investors with direct, on-chain access to infrastructure-backed yield. The offering targets 3-6% monthly returns, delivered through automated smart contract distributions. Bridging Bitcoin Mining and Tokenized Assets The infrastructure fund represents a significant innovation in the real-world asset tokenization space, allowing investors to participate in Bitcoin mining economics without the operational complexity of running a mining operation themselves. Investor capital funds modular Bitcoin mining operations across ERCOT (Texas), with revenue generated from both mining rewards and participation in energy market programs such as curtailment and ancillary services. ""This launch reflects the next stage of blockchain''s evolution—from speculative finance to scalable, compliant capital formation,"" said David Packham, CEO of Chintai. ""It''s a live example of how real-world assets can be made investable, auditable, and automated through blockchain."" Innovative Financial Engineering The fund combines elements of structured credit and infrastructure investing, creating a novel financial product native to blockchain. With development costs averaging $200,000 per megawatt and a projected break-even period of just over 12 months, Alteri''s operations are designed for capital efficiency. The fund''s architecture ensures verifiable on-chain distributions, with additional yield derived from energy arbitrage opportunities in the ERCOT grid. ""We''ve structured this offering to provide institutional-grade access to Bitcoin mining infrastructure—at a valuation that''s significantly lower than public market comps,"" said Alteri''s founder. ""It''s designed to be transparent, operationally sound, and now fully accessible on-chain."" Tax Advantages and Market Position US-based investors may benefit from 100% bonus depreciation on equipment in 2025, offering the potential for significant after-tax advantages. This feature makes the fund particularly attractive for institutional investors seeking tax-efficient exposure to digital asset infrastructure. The Alteri fund joins a growing ecosystem of tokenized real-world assets on the Chintai platform, which has previously facilitated the tokenization of real estate yields, ESG infrastructure investments, and carbon credits. Each new asset class brought on-chain demonstrates blockchain''s expanding utility beyond purely digital assets. Expanding the RWA Ecosystem This launch represents a key milestone in the evolution of blockchain-based finance, moving beyond speculative digital assets to tangible, yield-generating infrastructure investments. By bringing Bitcoin mining economics on-chain, Alteri creates opportunities for greater market efficiency and investor accessibility. The tokenized structure also opens possibilities for future DeFi integrations that would be impossible with traditional securities, including potential composability with lending protocols, liquidity pools, and other on-chain financial primitives.

As key regulations continue to be reviewed, the adoption landscape is evolving. New Chapters Being Written The news of the plan was shared yesterday by Reuters, with the Bank of America (BOA) joining the ranks of various institutional bodies that have endorsed the stablecoin plan under President Trump’s crypto-friendly legislation. Brian Moynihan, the CEO and President of BOA, noted that “ investors can expect the lender to move forward with it, ” but did not disclose any information as to when this can be expected. Further speaking to analysts during a post-earnings call, the CEO’s approach appears to be cautious and calculated, as they are currently exploring customer demand, which is presently low. The groundwork will likely begin “ at the appropriate time ” and “ in partnership with other players, ” with Moynihan comparing current stablecoin adoption levels of the industry with those of payment platforms like Zelle and Venmo. “ We’ve done a lot of work, ” said Moynihan, hinting that this may have been in development for a while now, but with “ banks still awaiting legal clarity, ” the progress has been slower than some investors would have liked. The wait will likely not be very long, as the trio of anticipated legislation bills —CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC — were advanced to the House floor for debate and consideration after a 9-hour stall of the vote. After speaking with the President late on Wednesday, the House Speaker told reporters: “I’m pleased that we’ll be able to get this done. The president is as well. I just spoke with him, and this is a big priority for him, and it was for us.” A Change of Heart The widespread adoption and ongoing plans for stablecoins by central US banks are in stark contrast to how they were viewed not that long ago. For example, when the BOA’s lead was asked if they planned to incorporate cryptocurrency in their services during a past World Economic Forum, the answer was a straightforward “no.” Previously skeptical as well, the third-largest bank in the United States, Citigroup, is also considering issuing its own stablecoin.

CryptoPotato asked ChatGPT about the cryptocurrency’s chances to go into uncharted territory in July since it failed to do so in January this year when it matched the 2018 record. The AI chatbot outlined why the $3.4 resistance could be harder to penetrate than most people expect, but also laid out several bullish factors that could propel another rally. Since then, XRP has increased by a few more cents and jumped to a new six-month peak of $3.34 (on Bitstamp) minutes ago. Thus, it was less than 2% away from a new all-time high.

2025-07-17 18:15:26+00:00,Thailand introduces crypto sandbox project allowing tourists to spend baht,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Bank of Thailand (BOT) have come up with a strategic program, “crypto sandbox,” making it much easier for foreign tourists to stay in Thailand. With the program, they can change their digital assets to Thailand’s baht currency . This project comes when Thailand aims to attract more tourists to increase revenue, contributing to the nation’s economic growth. Initially piloted in Phuket, the initiative now expands nationwide after receiving positive feedback and strong adoption. Thailand hopes the sandbox will boost tourism revenue and cement its role as a regional fintech leader by embracing crypto-friendly policies. Thailand embraces the crypto sandbox project under stricter regulatory measures The crypto sandbox project has greatly supported the crypto ecosystem. For instance, tourists possessing cryptocurrency like Bitcoin do not have to worry about how they will survive in Thailand. This is because the project permits them to freely access digital asset trading platforms like crypto exchanges, cryptocurrency middlemen, and dealers to convert their cryptocurrencies to the baht. Afterwards, the tourists can pay for goods and services using the QR codes obtained when they use Thailand’s currency on online payment platforms and digital wallets. Notably, based on the country’s regulations, one cannot directly make payments using cryptocurrencies. Therefore, as the project promotes financial technology, it provides a safer way to convert cryptocurrencies into regular money for use under the strict regulations set. The crypto sandbox project also includes protective measures to address economic challenges and ensure tourists use their funds responsibly. To achieve this, the project has outlined well-defined limits on how things will be operated in this sector. According to rules released in Thailand, all service issuers should obtain a license permitting them to carry out their operations and strictly adhere to the country’s know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. In addition, the sandbox has set aside rules that require foreign tourists in the country to undergo identity confirmation processes before taking the initiative to change their digital assets to Thailand’s currency. Similarly, the SEC has also applied spending measures to foreign tourists. Based on this regulation, the regulators will monitor and manage their transactions. For example, the tourists will only be allowed to consume a maximum of ฿50,000, worth nearly USD 1,375 monthly. This spending limitation will apply to local shops like food stalls and markets. On the other hand, for certified businesses like hotels and expensive restaurants, tourists’ monthly consumption limitation is raised to ฿500,000, which is approximately USD 13,750. Since this project is being exercised for the first time, it will effectively last 18 months. This may, however, be extended after regulators examine its performance, public reaction, and safety reports. Thailand’s sandbox project faces criticism from individuals Concerning the sandbox project, the SEC and BOT have opened room for public feedback with a deadline of August 13 this year. The regulators have also called on the individuals involved in the industry, banks, and companies in tourism to weigh in on the situation. This initiative aims to solidify the country’s position as the leader in the fintech space and make Thailand a region of new ideas. With safeguarding measures and regulations in place, it is anticipated that this will create a conducive environment for crypto and traditional money to cooperate and attract proprietors of digital assets worldwide. In the meantime, the project has faced criticism from several Phuket tourism sectors. Based on their argument, there is a shortage of education and communication on the project. This was not all, questions have been raised concerning which cryptocurrencies will be applied in this project, and the risk of abuse in the situation when monitoring systems are not strong enough. Despite all this, the project is still viewed as a game-changer for the tourism sector. If successfully adopted, other countries will be eager to apply it in their tourism sector, becoming a global FinTech trend.

Market participants remain on alert as top analyst Darkfost reported a major development involving one of the oldest and most closely watched wallets in crypto history. According to the analyst, the remaining 40,000 BTC—valued at approximately $4.75 billion—still held by the 80K Satoshi-era whale have all moved. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds – $0–$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive The shift began last night, signaling renewed activity from the early Bitcoin holder. Until now, only half of the whale’s holdings had been moved, while the rest remained dormant. This latest transfer marks the full mobilization of the entire 80,000 BTC once controlled by the entity. While the motive behind the move remains unknown, the market is watching closely for signs of potential selling or redistribution. Bitcoin’s ability to hold above key support levels despite this high-stakes movement may reflect strong demand and investor confidence. However, with $4.75 billion now in motion, traders are bracing for possible volatility ahead. The market is waiting to see if this event will trigger broader implications—or if it’s simply a strategic reshuffling from one of the ecosystem’s earliest whales. Satoshi-Era BTC Consolidates Into Single Address Darkfost highlighted a major on-chain development that has captured the market’s attention: Each of the four wallets, previously holding 10,000 BTC from the 80K whale, sent their funds to a single destination address bc1qs4nzm0je7wqfyfmqr4ht4upyzy57vc95nf4au0. This address now holds the entire $4.75 billion stash, raising new questions about the intent behind the move. According to Darkfost, while the pattern differs from previous sell-off precedents, the market must remain alert. “I guess these BTC might also end up hitting the market soon,” he commented. This kind of movement—especially from dormant, high-value wallets—often signals large-scale positioning, which can precede either institutional sales or strategic long-term storage. The timing coincides with rising bullish momentum across the crypto market. With Bitcoin consolidating above $118,000 following its $123,200 all-time high, traders are eyeing a potential breakout. Adding fuel to this outlook, all three key crypto-related bills were passed by the US House this week, removing significant regulatory uncertainty and clearing a path for broader adoption.

The Ohio-based Park National Bank, which U.S. Federal Reserve statistics indicate has more than $9.8 billion in consolidated assets, denies any wrongdoing or liability but opted to settle the case to avoid dealing with the cost of litigation. The bank agreed to create a settlement fund of $510,000, and it will also provide overdraft forgiveness as defined in the agreement. Of that settlement fund, up to $170,000 could go toward attorneys’ fees. The court will determine the amount of the attorneys’ fees and costs based on numerous factors, including risk, time and the outcome of the case. The court plans to hold a final approval hearing for the settlement on September 5th. If it is approved, payments should be made within two months of the effective date.

2025-07-17 19:15:02+00:00,Sberbank wants to provide custody services for domestic crypto assets,"Russian bank Sberbank plans to offer custody services for the country’s crypto assets. With more foreign banks embracing crypto custody, Anatoly Pronin, the Executive Director of Sberbank’s Alternative Payment Solutions Department, said they presented a proposal to the central bank on domestic crypto asset regulation. Lately, Russia’s central bank has been more open to pro-crypto policies. Last year, they permitted companies to trade in crypto to bypass Western sanctions implemented due to the Ukraine war. Russia’s Sberbank says it wants to regulate digital assets like the funds in bank accounts At a crypto regulation discussion, Pronin explained that Sberbank would want to oversee crypto assets like it does customer deposits, to ensure token security . He added that their custody service would include mechanisms to freeze assets upon suspicion of illegal activity and promote secure, accessible user transactions. Russia’s central bank disclosed it would allow financial institutions to provide crypto investment products in late May. It detailed that the new rules would cover instruments, including derivatives and tokenized instruments, tied to crypto value changes. However, investors can only engage in non-deliverable contracts, meaning they can’t hold or receive cryptocurrencies. The bank also stated that financial institutions must follow a risk-averse assessment strategy before launching crypto instruments to avoid compromising financial stability. However, the CBR never specified whether it would allow crypto custody services. Sberbank came up with a workaround to bypass Western sanctions Sberbank has been trying to make transactions easier for its users. In June, the bank devised a workaround that routes wire transfers to European banks via intermediaries, avoiding Western sanctions and the SWIFT bans. The bank’s clients can now transfer rubles through its mobile app to European cardholders at Revolut or N26. However, on the recipient’s side, the transfers do not display Sberbank’s name; instead, they show the name of a individual, a regional city, or a payment processing entity. So far, about 500,000 rubles, roughly $6400, can be transferred per transaction to European banks, with a monthly threshold of 3 million rubles, worth about $38,200. However, both N26 and Revolut distanced themselves from the alleged transfer scheme, insisting they prohibit any transactions that contravene sanctions. N26 said it routinely conducts compliance assessments, and Revolut warned users that such activity could lead to account restrictions. Regardless, one of the bank’s staff remarked, “It’s not dangerous. The bank has always had transfers like that.” Sberbank moves to expand crypto access for elite Russian investors Just recently, Sberbank said it would become a market maker providing liquidity for regulated platforms that will give qualified Russian investors access to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, a high-ranking executive unveiled. In an interview with business news outlet RBC, the head of Sberbank’s Global Markets Department, Alexander Zozulya, praised the Bank of Russia’s “important step” to announce the development of an experimental legal regime (ELR) for crypto transactions and emphasized: “We expect the emergence of a legal ‘sandbox,’ an analogue of a regulated crypto platform, where super-qualified investors will be allowed to operate directly with cryptocurrencies.” Zozulya’s remarks followed recent comments by Central Bank of Russia (CBR) Governor Elvira Nabiullina, who acknowledged earlier this month that direct investment in crypto assets would necessitate regulatory reforms and the development of dedicated infrastructure. During her appearance at the “Russian Stock Market—2025” conference in mid-May, Nabiullina also clarified that such transactions should be carried out exclusively within the ELR framework and available only to “highly qualified” investors. In March, the Central Bank introduced the special regime and the “ highly qualified investors ” category. Under the ELR, Russian companies will be permitted to use and exchange cryptocurrencies in foreign trade, providing a way to sidestep restrictions linked to the war in Ukraine.

2025-07-17 19:30:44+00:00,Digital Ruble Set to Revolutionize Russian Payments by 2026: A Major Shift,"BitcoinWorld Digital Ruble Set to Revolutionize Russian Payments by 2026: A Major Shift The financial world is constantly evolving, and a significant tremor has just been felt from Russia. A groundbreaking law has been approved, mandating the rollout of the digital ruble and universal QR payments across the nation, with a firm start date of September 1, 2026. This isn’t just another payment update; it’s a foundational shift that could redefine how money moves within the Russian financial system , echoing ripples across the global economic landscape. What is the Digital Ruble and Why is Russia Embracing it Now? For those familiar with the fast-paced world of cryptocurrencies, the term ‘digital currency’ might conjure images of Bitcoin or Ethereum. However, the digital ruble is fundamentally different. It’s a form of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), meaning it’s issued and backed by the Central Bank of Russia, just like physical cash or traditional bank deposits. Unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies, a CBDC is centralized and represents a direct liability of the central bank. So, why is Russia pushing for this now? The motivations are multifaceted, blending economic efficiency with strategic autonomy. For years, nations have explored CBDCs to modernize their payment infrastructure, reduce transaction costs, enhance financial inclusion, and gain greater control over monetary policy. For Russia, these benefits are amplified by its unique geopolitical context. A state-backed digital currency can offer a more resilient and independent payment system, potentially mitigating the impact of external financial pressures and sanctions. It’s a move towards bolstering financial sovereignty and innovation within the Russian financial system . Unpacking the Universal QR Payments Mandate: A Seamless Future? Alongside the digital ruble, the new law introduces a universal QR payments code. This is a crucial element of the grand design, aiming to simplify and standardize digital transactions across the board. Imagine a single QR code that works everywhere, regardless of your bank or the merchant’s bank. That’s the vision. Standardization: The mandate requires all banks and merchants to join the digital ruble platform and utilize this universal QR code. This means an end to fragmented payment systems where different apps or codes are needed for various merchants. Ease of Use: For consumers, making payments will become incredibly straightforward. Simply scan the universal QR code with your smartphone, confirm the amount, and the transaction is complete. No Client Fees: A particularly attractive feature is that banks cannot charge clients for using this QR code. This incentivizes adoption and reduces the cost of digital transactions for everyday users, making the digital ruble an appealing option for domestic transfers. Facilitating Digital Ruble Transfers: The QR code is designed to be the primary interface for initiating and receiving digital ruble transactions, ensuring widespread usability for the new currency. This universal approach to QR payments is a clear signal that Russia intends to create a highly integrated and efficient digital payment ecosystem, making the transition to the digital ruble as smooth as possible for its citizens and businesses. The Ambitious Rollout: A Phased Approach to Russia CBDC Implementing a nationwide digital currency system is no small feat. Recognizing the complexity, Russia has outlined a phased rollout strategy to ensure a stable and successful transition for its Russia CBDC initiative. According to Interfax, the timeline is clear: Phase Timeline Participants Key Action Phase 1 Starting September 1, 2026 Major Banks & Merchants Must support digital ruble transactions and universal QR payments. Phase 2 By 2028 Smaller Banks Gradual integration into the digital ruble platform. This staggered approach allows major financial institutions to iron out any technical kinks and gather user feedback before the system is fully expanded. It’s a pragmatic way to manage the massive undertaking of integrating a new form of money into the existing Russian financial system . The initial focus on major banks ensures that a significant portion of the population and commercial activity is covered from the outset, paving the way for broader adoption. How Will This Impact the Central Bank Digital Currency Landscape? Russia’s move into the realm of Central Bank Digital Currency is part of a broader global trend, yet it carries unique implications. While countries like China have already launched their digital yuan, and the European Central Bank is actively exploring a digital euro, Russia’s geopolitical position adds a distinct layer to its CBDC strategy. Globally, CBDCs are seen as a way for central banks to retain relevance in an increasingly digital world, offer a sovereign alternative to private digital currencies, and enhance the efficiency of payment systems.

The court extended Zettai’s moratorium protection and allowed the revote following further arguments presented by WazirX’s parent company. If the amended scheme receives approval from the requisite majority of creditors and court sanction, the WazirX platform will reopen with Zanmai facilitating distributions under Indian jurisdiction.

WazirX had secured a four-month conditional moratorium in September 2024, which protected the company from litigation in different regions. The June 4 rejection also opened the door for Indian users to file litigation domestically to seek recovery of their locked funds. The exchange warned users in February that repayments could be delayed until 2030 if the court rejected the restructuring plan, potentially forcing the company into liquidation.

First-Time Bitcoin Buyers Have Increased Supply By 2.86% In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin ‘First Buyers.’ This cohort is part of Glassnode’s broader investor classification system that is based on behavior. The First Buyers include, as the name already hints, the holders who are buying the cryptocurrency for the first time. The supply associated with the group, therefore, can be considered as a proxy of the fresh capital entering into the sector. Related Reading: XRP Close Above This Level Could Send Price To $4.80, Analyst Says Other groups part of the behavioral classification include Momentum Buyers, the investors who ride the tide of price trends, and Conviction Buyers, who step in to buy during price declines. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin supply held by the First Buyers over the last couple of weeks. As displayed in the graph, the Bitcoin First Buyers have seen their supply go up during the last two weeks, implying that fresh capital has potentially been entering the market. More specifically, the cohort’s holdings have gone from 4.77 million BTC to 4.91 million BTC in this period, corresponding to an increase of around 140,000 tokens or 2.86%. This is notable and suggests the price surge to the new all-time high (ATH) has attracted real demand. In some other news, the Bitcoin Puell Multiple has been relatively muted even after the price rally, as an analyst has pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post. The Puell Multiple is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the daily value of coins being ‘issued’ by miners on the blockchain (in USD) and the 365-day moving average (MA) of the same. In short, the indicator informs us about whether the Bitcoin miners are currently making more revenue from block subsidy compared to the norm or not. Historically, the indicator shooting up to an extreme value has generally aligned with some sort of top for the cryptocurrency. As is visible in the chart, the BTC Puell Multiple is currently sitting around 1.2, which means that miners are making more than the average for the past year, but not by too much. If the past trend is anything to go by, this may be a potential sign that the current cycle still has room for growth. Related Reading: Bitcoin Next Key Level Is $136,000 If Momentum Holds, Glassnode Says Something to note, however, is the fact that the indicator’s peaks have been trending lower with each cycle.

2025-07-17 20:00:12+00:00,Ex-SEC Attorney Discredits One Major Rumor About XRP in Ripple Case,"A rumor suggesting Ripple might pay its court-imposed penalty using XRP has been firmly shut down by former SEC attorney Marc Fagel. The claim, which resurfaced this week within the XRP community, was sparked by speculation that the U.S. government’s recent Bitcoin sales were linked to preparations for accepting XRP as a settlement currency. Fagel, however, directly dismissed this theory as fiction, stating that Ripple has already paid the penalty in cash as ordered by the court. XRP Community Speculation Resurfaces The discussion was reignited when crypto personality Zach Rector posed a provocative question on X: “Why didn’t the government want to hold onto its Bitcoin?” In response, XRP commentator “XRP Savant” suggested it was part of a broader setup for Ripple to settle its SEC penalty in XRP. “Setting the stage for Ripple to pay $150M SEC fine with XRP. Then it goes into reserve,” Savant claimed, adding, “As I predicted 4 months ago. It’s nice to see the experts finally catch up with the Savant.” They already paid in cash. Sorry. — Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 16, 2025 Savant also cited an April 11 post by analyst John Squire, who wrote: “Ripple vs SEC: The endgame is near. Brad Garlinghouse confirms the lawsuit might be wrapping up. The fine could even be paid in XRP.” Marc Fagel Sets the Record Straight Marc Fagel, a former SEC San Francisco Regional Director, quickly entered the conversation to correct the record. Quoting the original claim, he stated unequivocally: “They already paid in cash. Sorry.” When pressed with Squire’s speculative post, Fagel followed up with a firmer clarification: “I’m stating facts. There’s a court order that they pay cash into escrow. But you can imagine anything you’d like.” Fagel’s comments refer to court documents from the Ripple case, which show that the company was ordered to deposit $125 million, not $150 million, into escrow in U.S. dollars as part of its proposed final judgment with the SEC.

2025-07-17 20:15:24+00:00,BlackRock has finally filed to enable staking for its ETH ETFs,"World-leading asset manager BlackRock has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for its spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). Nasdaq filed the proposed rule change on July 17. If approved, the firm can stake part or all of the ETH underlying its spot ETH ETF (ETHA) through any staking services providers. With the move, BlackRock has joined the list of spot ETH ETF issuers seeking SEC approval to allow staking. While others, such as Franklin Templeton, Fidelity , 21Shares, and Grayscale, have already applied for the same permit, the move by BlackRock represents the biggest positive sign of potential approval of such products. Efforts to allow staking for ETH ETFs and other altcoin ETFs have intensified since the Donald Trump administration started, and the SEC has changed its approach to many crypto issues, including Ethereum staking. This led to the regulator dropping staking-related lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. Before now, the ETF issuers were forced to amend their filings and drop staking from their Ethereum ETF applications in 2024 after the Gary Gensler-led SEC flagged Ethereum staking, noting that it could be unregistered securities. Fight for ETH staking in ETFs that are far from over With BlackRock submitting its 19b-4 filing, many in the crypto industry believe that staking for ETFs is now a done deal. This is not surprising given the firm’s record of only one refusal by the SEC for all its ETF applications and over 500 approvals. However, experts believe that the fight is not over yet. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted that there are several staking ETF filings before the SEC, and for earlier filings, the final deadline is late October. The final deadline for BlackRock’s filing is not until April 2026, but the analyst expects a decision from the regulator by Q4 of this year. Seyffart said: “Staking is not ‘done.’ There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October. The Blackrock filing today won’t have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25).” Seyffart noted that the major challenge that staking ETF approval will face now is not from the SEC but rather from the Internal Revenue Service. However, he did not go further into how this could be a problem. ETH doubles in value within 3 months thanks to ETFs and Institutional accumulation Meanwhile, the timing of BlackRock’s filing coincides with ETH’s recent performance, which has seen the token wipe out all its losses for the year and finally have a positive year-to-date performance. Over the past three months, ETH price has increased by 114%, a trend that is also evident within shorter periods, with a 38.5% gain in 30 days and 21.12% gains in seven days. The token is now trading at $3,420 and is up 2% year to date.

KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/blackrock-pushes-for-ethereum-staking-in-etf-as-institutional-inflows-hit-5-5-billion/,ETH|REGULATION|EXCHANGE|ALTCOIN|BTC,Ethereum|BlackRock,BTC,"BlackRock has finally filed to enable staking for its ETH ETFs. World-leading asset manager BlackRock has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to allow staking for its spot Ether exchange-traded fund (ETF). Nasdaq filed the proposed rule change on July 17. If approved, the firm can stake part or all of the ETH underlying its spot ETH ETF (ETHA) through any staking services providers. With the move, BlackRock has joined the list of spot ETH ETF issuers seeking SEC approval to allow staking. While others, such as Franklin Templeton, Fidelity , 21Shares, and Grayscale, have already applied for the same permit, the move by BlackRock represents the biggest positive sign of potential approval of such products. Efforts to allow staking for ETH ETFs and other altcoin ETFs have intensified since the Donald Trump administration started, and the SEC has changed its approach to many crypto issues, including Ethereum staking. This led to the regulator dropping staking-related lawsuits against Coinbase and Kraken. Before now, the ETF issuers were forced to amend their filings and drop staking from their Ethereum ETF applications in 2024 after the Gary Gensler-led SEC flagged Ethereum staking, noting that it could be unregistered securities. Fight for ETH staking in ETFs that are far from over With BlackRock submitting its 19b-4 filing, many in the crypto industry believe that staking for ETFs is now a done deal. This is not surprising given the firm’s record of only one refusal by the SEC for all its ETF applications and over 500 approvals. However, experts believe that the fight is not over yet. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart noted that there are several staking ETF filings before the SEC, and for earlier filings, the final deadline is late October. The final deadline for BlackRock’s filing is not until April 2026, but the analyst expects a decision from the regulator by Q4 of this year. Seyffart said: “Staking is not ‘done.’ There are plenty of ETH staking ETF filings already on the books. Final deadline for earlier filings is in late October. The Blackrock filing today won’t have a final deadline until ~April 2026 (but we think staking will likely be approved by at least 4Q25).” Seyffart noted that the major challenge that staking ETF approval will face now is not from the SEC but rather from the Internal Revenue Service. However, he did not go further into how this could be a problem. ETH doubles in value within 3 months thanks to ETFs and Institutional accumulation Meanwhile, the timing of BlackRock’s filing coincides with ETH’s recent performance, which has seen the token wipe out all its losses for the year and finally have a positive year-to-date performance. Over the past three months, ETH price has increased by 114%, a trend that is also evident within shorter periods, with a 38.5% gain in 30 days and 21.12% gains in seven days.

2025-07-17 20:36:04+00:00,Asia-Pacific Faces Record Bitcoin Thefts and Deadly “Wrench Attacks”—Chainalysis,"Violent attacks targeting cryptocurrency holders are on track to hit record highs in 2025, with Asia-Pacific among the hardest-hit regions, according to a new report from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. These incidents, commonly known as “wrench attacks,” involve criminals using physical violence or threats to coerce victims into surrendering their digital assets. 2025 On Track to Double Record Year for Crypto-Linked Kidnappings and Thefts As of July, 35 wrench attacks have already been recorded globally, surpassing nearly all previous years and placing 2025 on course to double the record set during the 2021 bull run. Source: Jameson Lopp GitHub Chainalysis says the spike is closely tied to Bitcoin’s rising price, which hit an all-time high of over $122,000 in early July . “These are not just digital crimes anymore,” a Chainalysis spokesperson said. “We’re seeing more kidnappings, extortion cases, and home invasions tied to crypto ownership—particularly in regions with fast-growing retail adoption.” The shift from online exploits to real-world violence comes amid a broader wave of crypto-related theft. Chainalysis estimates that over $2.17 billion has been stolen from cryptocurrency services so far in 2025, already surpassing the total for all of 2024 . Now, attacks on personal wallets account for nearly a quarter of all stolen funds this year. Chainalysis reports that these crimes are increasingly targeting users, often with devastating consequences. Bitcoin holders, in particular, are experiencing higher average losses, as criminals appear to prioritize large-value wallets. Chainalysis data also shows that the Asia-Pacific region ranks second globally in total Bitcoin stolen and third in Ether theft. Within APAC, countries like Japan, Indonesia, and South Korea have reported a rise in thefts, while nations such as the Philippines are grappling with more extreme outcomes. Source: Chainalysis Chainalysis warns that while wrench attacks are still relatively rare, they have an outsized impact. The physical nature of these crimes, including cases of maiming, kidnapping, and homicide, raises new concerns for crypto users and law enforcement alike. Crypto Wallet Thefts Shift Toward Retail Targets as Losses Mount in 2025 New data reveals a growing trend in crypto-related crimes targeting retail wallet holders, with wallet thefts now causing major financial damage across both developed and emerging markets. While the United States, Germany, and Japan report the highest number of victims, countries like India, Chile, the United Arab Emirates, and Norway are seeing higher average losses per victim. According to Chainalysis, North America currently leads the world in total crypto stolen, followed by Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. The shift toward targeting users, rather than exchanges or protocols, reflects broader changes in the crypto threat environment. One reason for this shift is improved cybersecurity at centralized exchanges, which has made large platforms more difficult for attackers to penetrate. At the same time, the rising number of high-value self-custodied wallets and the relative ease of identifying crypto holders online have made users increasingly attractive targets. Chainalysis also noted a rise in attacker sophistication, pointing to the use of AI-driven tools to locate, deceive, or coerce victims. “The rise of wrench attacks is a stark reminder that digital assets are only as safe as the people who hold them,” the firm said. Recent findings from blockchain security firm CertiK support the trend. In its midyear report for 2025, CertiK said crypto investors lost more than $2.2 billion to hacks, scams, and security breaches in just the first six months of the year.

2025-07-17 20:40:18+00:00,Bitcoin Treasury: DV8’s Bold Move to Transform Southeast Asia’s Crypto Landscape,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasury: DV8’s Bold Move to Transform Southeast Asia’s Crypto Landscape In a groundbreaking announcement that sent ripples across the Asian financial landscape, Thai-listed company DV8 revealed its audacious plan to become Southeast Asia’s first dedicated Bitcoin treasury firm. This strategic pivot, fueled by a successful 241 million baht (approximately $7.4 million) capital raise, marks a significant milestone in the mainstream adoption of digital assets within the region. For investors and enthusiasts alike, this move signals a new era where traditional companies are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of Bitcoin as a core treasury asset. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Treasury , and Why Now? At its core, a Bitcoin treasury strategy involves a company holding a significant portion of its corporate reserves in Bitcoin, rather than solely in traditional fiat currencies or conventional assets. This concept gained considerable traction following MicroStrategy’s pioneering adoption, which saw the business intelligence firm accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. The rationale behind such a move is multi-faceted: Inflation Hedge: In an era of increasing quantitative easing and inflationary concerns, Bitcoin’s fixed supply cap of 21 million coins positions it as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Digital Gold Narrative: Often referred to as ‘digital gold,’ Bitcoin shares characteristics with traditional safe-haven assets, offering a decentralized and censorship-resistant store of value. Long-Term Value Appreciation: Proponents believe Bitcoin’s fundamental properties and growing network effect will lead to significant long-term capital appreciation, enhancing corporate balance sheets. Market Leadership: Being an early mover in this space can signal innovation and attract a new class of forward-thinking investors. DV8’s decision underscores a growing global trend where corporations are exploring alternatives to traditional cash management strategies, seeking to optimize their balance sheets in a rapidly evolving economic climate. DV8 ‘s Ambitious Vision: Emulating the Giants The news, initially reported by Odaily, highlights DV8’s clear intention to follow in the footsteps of companies like MicroStrategy. The Thai firm’s 241 million baht raise provides the foundational capital for this transformation. But what exactly does this mean for DV8? By transforming into a ‘cryptocurrency reserve company,’ DV8 aims to: Acquire and Hold Bitcoin: The primary objective will be to purchase and securely hold Bitcoin as a significant portion of its treasury assets. Boost Shareholder Value: This is the ultimate goal. By leveraging Bitcoin’s potential for appreciation, DV8 hopes to significantly enhance its financial position and, consequently, the value for its shareholders. Set a Precedent: As the first of its kind in Southeast Asia, DV8 is positioning itself as a pioneer, potentially inspiring other regional companies to explore similar strategies. This bold move by DV8 is not just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about fundamentally re-evaluating traditional corporate finance in the digital age. Pioneering the Path for Southeast Asia Crypto Adoption DV8’s pivot carries immense significance for the broader Southeast Asia crypto landscape. The region, known for its dynamic economies and tech-savvy population, has shown increasing interest in digital assets, but corporate adoption at this scale has been relatively limited. DV8’s initiative could serve as a powerful catalyst: Increased Legitimacy: A publicly listed company embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset lends significant credibility to the cryptocurrency space within the region. Regulatory Dialogue: Such high-profile moves often spur clearer regulatory frameworks, which are crucial for sustainable growth and broader institutional participation. Regional Inspiration: Other companies in Thailand and neighboring countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Vietnam might observe DV8’s performance closely, potentially leading to a domino effect of corporate Bitcoin adoption. Investment Hub: This could further cement Southeast Asia’s reputation as a growing hub for blockchain innovation and cryptocurrency investment. The move by DV8 could be the spark that ignites a new wave of corporate interest in digital assets across one of the world’s most vibrant economic regions. The MicroStrategy Model : A Blueprint for Corporate Bitcoin Holdings When DV8 explicitly states its inspiration from MicroStrategy, it’s worth examining what this MicroStrategy model entails.

2025-07-17 20:43:57+00:00,"U.S. House officially approves CLARITY, GENIUS, and Anti-CBDC Acts","The House passed three major crypto bills on Thursday, locking in a rare legislative win for the industry. In what’s now the biggest regulatory overhaul for crypto so far, lawmakers voted on the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. The votes came after months of lobbying and internal fights between Democrats over how to approach crypto regulation heading into 2025. The GENIUS Act , which had already cleared the Senate, got a final vote of 308-122 in the House. That bill sets rules for stablecoins and is now headed straight to President Donald Trump’s desk. More than 100 Democrats backed the bill, including Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, joining most Republicans in a rare moment of bipartisan agreement. The goal is to treat crypto more like real money, giving companies the regulatory clarity they’ve been demanding for years. House sends GENIUS and CLARITY bills to Trump Right after that, the House passed the CLARITY Act with a 294-134 vote. This bill is much broader, outlining how crypto firms should register, disclose information, and follow financial rules across different agencies. Seventy-eight Democrats crossed over to back the legislation alongside Republicans. Nancy Pelosi and Pete Aguilar both voted in favor, but Jeffries didn’t. He rejected the CLARITY Act, even though he had supported GENIUS minutes earlier. There was pushback. Maxine Waters, top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, warned the bills could trigger financial instability and give President Trump a chance to exploit gaps in the system. She said the crypto-friendly rules could “enable corruption,” and questioned whether any of it was designed to protect the economy at all. The Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act was also passed . That bill blocks the Federal Reserve from creating or piloting any kind of central bank digital currency (CBDC) unless Congress gives the green light. Most Republicans supported it overwhelmingly, saying they don’t want programmable money that lets the government track or control individual transactions. Emmer restricts Fed’s CBDC powers, while Trump’s health raises risk for reversal Tom Emmer, the Minnesota Republican who introduced the bill, added strict rules to make sure no loopholes exist. The legislation says the Federal Reserve can’t “offer products or services directly to an individual,” can’t “maintain an account on behalf of an individual,” and can’t use any renamed version of a CBDC. It also blocks the Fed from using any central bank digital currency to carry out monetary policy. In short, no CBDC, no pilot programs, no technical workarounds. Crypto czar David Sacks praised the House’s votes on X, saying, “Massive wins for crypto in the House: GENIUS Act passes 307-122. CLARITY Act passes 294-134.” The post quickly went viral in crypto circles as the numbers confirmed a landslide. Billy Hagerty, the Senator who originally introduced the GENIUS Act, said the law would update America’s payment systems and boost demand for U.S. Treasuries, adding that it would help make the country the “crypto capital of the world.” Paul Atkins, the pro-crypto SEC chair, said he supports the GENIUS Act because it provides “clear rules of the road” for the industry. He said the law would cut transaction costs, increase speed, and reduce risk, while keeping essential protections in place. Atkins also said this marks a turning point for the U.S. to become a global leader in blockchain tech, not just traditional finance. Meanwhile, the White House confirmed that President Trump is dealing with a chronic vein condition after people noticed bruises on his hand. Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary, said Trump had experienced leg swelling and underwent a “comprehensive exam” including a vascular study. If his condition worsens, any or all of the crypto bills could be reversed, just like Trump did to many of Joe Biden’s past policies when he took office. Not everyone is convinced these new laws are safe. Elizabeth Warren, who has been against the crypto industry for nearly a decade, repeated that the bills could wreck the economy if they’re not backed by tough oversight. She added that she doesn’t want to see laws written by “crypto industry lobbyists” getting passed, and she called the current versions “very weak regulation.” “They also don’t put enough safeguards in place for consumer protection,” Elizabeth said. “And guardrails to make sure that crypto isn’t used to blow up our entire economy. So I’m very worried about that.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Meanwhile, the White House confirmed that President Trump is dealing with a chronic vein condition after people noticed bruises on his hand. Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary, said Trump had experienced leg swelling and underwent a “comprehensive exam” including a vascular study. If his condition worsens, any or all of the crypto bills could be reversed, just like Trump did to many of Joe Biden’s past policies when he took office. Not everyone is convinced these new laws are safe. Elizabeth Warren, who has been against the crypto industry for nearly a decade, repeated that the bills could wreck the economy if they’re not backed by tough oversight. She added that she doesn’t want to see laws written by “crypto industry lobbyists” getting passed, and she called the current versions “very weak regulation.” “They also don’t put enough safeguards in place for consumer protection,” Elizabeth said. “And guardrails to make sure that crypto isn’t used to blow up our entire economy. So I’m very worried about that.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025. Learn More"
2025-07-17 20:50:15+00:00,Bitcoin Investors Fuel Remarkable 140K BTC Accumulation Surge in July,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Investors Fuel Remarkable 140K BTC Accumulation Surge in July The cryptocurrency world is perpetually buzzing with activity, and Bitcoin, as its pioneer, often takes center stage. Recently, a fascinating trend has emerged, highlighting the underlying strength of the market: a significant influx of capital from new Bitcoin investors . This isn’t just about price pumps; it’s about a quiet yet powerful accumulation that speaks volumes about confidence in the digital gold. Who are these New Bitcoin Investors Driving the Market? In a compelling revelation, data from on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, as cited by Cointelegraph, indicates a substantial increase in holdings by new Bitcoin (BTC) buyers. During the month of July, these fresh participants added a remarkable 140,000 BTC to their portfolios. This represents an impressive 2.86% increase in their total holdings over just two weeks. This isn’t merely speculative trading; it suggests a strategic move by entities or individuals entering the market with a long-term perspective. What defines a “new” investor in this context? Glassnode’s methodology often tracks wallets or entities that have recently become active or started accumulating Bitcoin, distinguishing them from long-term holders or those engaged in short-term trading. The fact that such a significant volume of Bitcoin is being absorbed by this segment points to a broadening base of support for the cryptocurrency, moving beyond the usual suspects and seasoned veterans. The Power of BTC Accumulation: What Does 140,000 BTC Mean? The sheer volume of BTC accumulation by new investors – 140,000 Bitcoins – is a critical metric. To put this into perspective, this amount represents a substantial portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply, especially when accumulated within such a short timeframe. This aggressive buying pattern suggests strong underlying demand that is capable of absorbing selling pressure and providing a solid foundation for price stability and growth. This accumulation trend has several profound implications for the market: Reduced Circulating Supply: As more Bitcoin is moved into longer-term holdings by new participants, the amount available for trading on exchanges decreases, creating a supply squeeze. Increased Market Confidence: It signals a growing belief in Bitcoin’s value proposition, not just among existing enthusiasts but also among fresh capital sources. Foundation for Future Price Appreciation: Persistent accumulation, particularly during market dips, establishes strong support levels, making future price rallies more sustainable. This steady absorption of Bitcoin by new hands indicates a maturing market where participants are increasingly viewing BTC as a legitimate asset class rather than just a speculative gamble. Is a Bitcoin Price Surge Sustainable Without Retail FOMO? Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of this current market dynamic is the disconnect between the significant buying activity and the seemingly subdued retail interest. Despite the clear upward trajectory and consistent capital inflow, mainstream “fear of missing out” (FOMO) appears to be notably absent. Google Trends data, often a reliable indicator of public sentiment and retail engagement, shows low levels of search queries related to Bitcoin and its price surges. This phenomenon presents a unique scenario for a potential Bitcoin price surge : Institutional or High-Net-Worth Driven: The lack of retail FOMO, coupled with strong accumulation, suggests that the fresh capital might be coming from larger entities, institutional investors, or high-net-worth individuals who operate with less emotional bias and more strategic foresight. Healthy Growth Dynamics: Unlike past bull runs fueled primarily by speculative retail frenzy, the current accumulation pattern appears more organic and fundamentally driven. This could lead to a more stable and sustainable price appreciation, less prone to sudden corrections triggered by panic selling. Buying the Dips: The report highlights that this fresh capital continues to support BTC’s price breakout, particularly during dips below key thresholds like $11,800. This behavior underscores a belief in Bitcoin’s value at these levels, reinforcing its role as a robust store of value. The absence of widespread retail euphoria might be a blessing in disguise, allowing Bitcoin to build a stronger, more resilient foundation for its next major move.

2025-07-17 20:59:11+00:00,Trump To Sign Historic Crypto Legislation As House Greenlights 3 Key Bills,"On July 17, 2025, a historic day for the entire crypto industry, the House of Representatives passed all three major crypto bills, marking a crucial victory for digital asset proponents. The country’s stablecoin bill, the GENIUS Act, in particular, is now set to be presented to President Donald Trump, marking the potential for the first substantial piece of cryptocurrency legislation to be signed into law. Historic Vote For Crypto Bills As reported by Fox journalist Eleanor Terret on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), both Democrats and Republicans rallied together, voting in a manner that exceeded expectations. The path forward in the Senate, however, remains fraught with challenges. TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg noted that while the passage of these bills is symbolically significant, the real test will come with the Senate’s ability to build the necessary bipartisan consensus to avoid a filibuster. Seiberg expressed skepticism about receiving comprehensive details on the Senate’s plans until late this year or early next year, emphasizing that the language of any Senate-approved bill will ultimately determine its fate. GENIUS Act Secures Strong Approval The House votes were telling of the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency in American politics. The CLARITY Act received overwhelming support, passing with a vote of 294 to 134, which included 78 Democrats—more than double the anticipated number. This was a stark contrast to the previous year when only 71 voted for the FIT21 legislation. The GENIUS Act followed suit, passing with a vote of 308 to 122, supported by 102 Democrats. The Anti-CBDC Act, while more narrowly passed at 219 to 210, still saw bipartisan backing with two Democrats joining Republicans in favor.

2025-07-17 21:00:58+00:00,Russia to Launch Digital Ruble in 2026 Despite Public Concerns,"Russia is officially moving forward with plans to introduce its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) , the digital ruble. The lower house of parliament has recently approved a bill that sets September 1, 2026, as the official rollout date for the digital currency. However, even as the government pushes ahead, a new survey shows that most Russians are still unsure or unwilling to use it. The Digital Ruble is Not a Cryptocurrency The CBDC is a digital version of Russia’s currency. It will be created, issued, and controlled by the Central Bank of Russia. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies, this currency will not be decentralized. The government will monitor every transaction, and the central bank will oversee its use. CBDCs, such as the digital ruble, are being explored by many countries. They aim to make payments faster, safer, and more efficiently. However, in Russia, people are not yet convinced. Most Russians Say No to Ruble Over Privacy Fears A recent government-backed survey shows that more than half of Russians are not ready to use the digital ruble. According to the poll, 51% of people said they would not adopt it, while only 35% said they might try it. Many respondents stated that they did not see any significant benefits in switching to the e-ruble. Some of the biggest concerns include data privacy and the fear of government surveillance. Only 12% of those polled trust that their personal information would be safe. Just 8% are worried the government could track their spending, and only 7% of people said they fully understand how the system works. Despite these concerns, Russia is moving forward. The new law requires large businesses to accept digital ruble payments starting in 2026. Mid-sized companies will have until 2027 to comply, while smaller businesses must follow by 2028. However, there are some exceptions. Very small merchants and those without internet are exempt. The law also introduces a universal QR code payment system for easier digital payment. Lawmakers believe this system will help reduce payment fees and increase usage. Russia Hits Pause on Digital Ruble Rollout Amid Banking Pushback Initially, Russia’s Central Bank had planned to launch the digital ruble in July 2025, but the launch faced delays. Big banks, such as Sberbank, and many business owners raised concerns about costs and technical issues. As a result, the government pushed the launch date to 2026. Still, the Central Bank has been testing the digital ruble since 2023 through consumer pilot programs. Officials say the digital ruble will help Russia avoid relying on Western payment systems, especially important under current sanctions . The bill still needs final approval from the Federation Council and President Vladimir Putin. However, these steps are expected to be completed without issue. Once approved, Russia will begin preparing for the full rollout in 2026.

2025-07-17 21:20:01+00:00,Bitmine Immersion’s Monumental $1 Billion Ethereum Holdings: A Game-Changer for Crypto Treasury Strategy,"BitcoinWorld Bitmine Immersion’s Monumental $1 Billion Ethereum Holdings: A Game-Changer for Crypto Treasury Strategy In a move that has sent ripples across the digital asset landscape, Bitmine Immersion, a Nasdaq-listed entity previously known primarily for its Bitcoin (BTC) mining operations, has unveiled a staggering achievement: its Ethereum holdings have officially surpassed the $1 billion mark. This isn’t just a number; it’s a profound statement about the evolving nature of corporate finance and a bold embrace of a multi-asset digital treasury strategy. As reported by Aggr News on X, this strategic accumulation of Ethereum (ETH) signals a significant pivot, showcasing a forward-thinking approach to managing corporate assets in the volatile yet opportunity-rich cryptocurrency market. Understanding Bitmine Immersion’s Bold Pivot: Why Ethereum? For years, Bitmine Immersion has been synonymous with Bitcoin mining, diligently converting computational power into BTC. However, their recent disclosure of a $1 billion ETH treasury signals a deliberate and strategic shift. This isn’t a mere speculative gamble; it’s a calculated decision rooted in a deeper understanding of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Diversification Beyond Bitcoin: While Bitcoin remains the undisputed king of cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization and adoption as a store of value, Ethereum offers a different value proposition. It’s the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and a vast ecosystem of decentralized applications (dApps). Holding ETH allows Bitmine Immersion to tap into the growth potential of this broader digital economy. Yield Opportunities: Ethereum, particularly after its transition to Proof-of-Stake (the Merge), offers staking rewards. This means that simply holding ETH can generate passive income, a compelling factor for a corporate treasury looking to maximize returns on its assets. This contrasts with Bitcoin, which primarily offers capital appreciation. Strategic Alignment with Innovation: By holding ETH, Bitmine Immersion positions itself closer to the forefront of blockchain innovation. Ethereum’s continuous development, including scalability solutions and upgrades, promises sustained relevance and growth. Hedge Against Single-Asset Risk: Relying solely on Bitcoin exposes a company to the specific market dynamics and volatility of a single asset. Diversifying into Ethereum mitigates this risk, providing a more balanced exposure to the overall crypto market. The Evolution of Corporate Crypto Treasury Strategy The concept of a corporate crypto treasury strategy has rapidly evolved. What began with pioneering companies like MicroStrategy making massive Bitcoin acquisitions has now matured into more sophisticated approaches. Initially, the primary motivation was often seen as an inflation hedge or a bold statement of belief in Bitcoin’s future. However, as the crypto market matured, so too did the strategies employed by companies. Early adopters faced significant scrutiny and volatility. Yet, their conviction paved the way for others. Today, companies are not just buying Bitcoin; they are exploring a wider array of digital assets, seeking specific utilities, yield opportunities, and risk mitigation. This shift reflects a growing institutional comfort level with cryptocurrencies as legitimate asset classes, moving beyond pure speculation to integrated financial planning. Key Trends in Corporate Crypto Treasury: From Speculation to Strategy: Initial forays were often seen as opportunistic. Now, companies are integrating crypto into their long-term financial planning, complete with risk assessments and allocation models. Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin often forms the foundational layer, companies are increasingly looking at Ethereum for its ecosystem benefits and other altcoins for specific use cases or higher growth potential. Yield Generation: The ability to earn yield through staking, lending, or DeFi protocols is a major draw, transforming static holdings into productive assets. Regulatory Compliance: As the space matures, companies are placing a greater emphasis on navigating the complex regulatory landscape, ensuring compliance with accounting standards and tax laws. What This Means for Bitcoin Mining Firms Traditionally, a Bitcoin mining firm generates revenue by mining BTC and then either holding it or selling it to cover operational costs. Bitmine Immersion’s move challenges this conventional model. It suggests a future where mining companies are not just producers of a single digital commodity but active managers of diversified digital asset portfolios. For a Bitcoin mining firm, holding significant amounts of Ethereum offers several advantages: Enhanced Revenue Streams: Beyond selling mined BTC, the firm can now generate returns from its ETH holdings through staking or other DeFi protocols.

Today, companies are not just buying Bitcoin; they are exploring a wider array of digital assets, seeking specific utilities, yield opportunities, and risk mitigation. This shift reflects a growing institutional comfort level with cryptocurrencies as legitimate asset classes, moving beyond pure speculation to integrated financial planning. Key Trends in Corporate Crypto Treasury: From Speculation to Strategy: Initial forays were often seen as opportunistic. Now, companies are integrating crypto into their long-term financial planning, complete with risk assessments and allocation models. Diversification is Key: While Bitcoin often forms the foundational layer, companies are increasingly looking at Ethereum for its ecosystem benefits and other altcoins for specific use cases or higher growth potential. Yield Generation: The ability to earn yield through staking, lending, or DeFi protocols is a major draw, transforming static holdings into productive assets. Regulatory Compliance: As the space matures, companies are placing a greater emphasis on navigating the complex regulatory landscape, ensuring compliance with accounting standards and tax laws. What This Means for Bitcoin Mining Firms Traditionally, a Bitcoin mining firm generates revenue by mining BTC and then either holding it or selling it to cover operational costs. Bitmine Immersion’s move challenges this conventional model. It suggests a future where mining companies are not just producers of a single digital commodity but active managers of diversified digital asset portfolios. For a Bitcoin mining firm, holding significant amounts of Ethereum offers several advantages: Enhanced Revenue Streams: Beyond selling mined BTC, the firm can now generate returns from its ETH holdings through staking or other DeFi protocols.

2025-07-17 21:23:23+00:00,Trump Prepares To Allow Crypto Investments In $9 Trillion Retirement Market,"President Donald Trump is reportedly poised to open the $9 trillion retirement market to a range of alternative investments, including crypto, gold, and private equity. According to the Financial Times, this initiative is expected to be formalized through an executive order as early as this week. It seeks to diversify the investment options available within 401(k) plans, which have traditionally been limited to stocks and bonds. Crypto In Retirement Savings Trump’s forthcoming executive order will direct regulatory agencies to explore the necessary adjustments to facilitate the inclusion of these alternative asset classes in professionally managed retirement funds. According to insiders familiar with the plan, this shift aims to enable American workers to invest their retirement savings in a broader spectrum of opportunities, including digital assets, metals, and funds that focus on private loans and corporate takeovers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Influx Of New Capital: First-Time Buyers Add 140,000 BTC This executive order marks a significant acceleration in Trump’s efforts to mainstream cryptocurrency investments. His administration has already taken steps to ease regulatory burdens, notably by reversing a Biden-era policy that discouraged the inclusion of crypto options in retirement accounts. The recent passage of three crypto-related bills by the House, which Trump has vocally supported, further underscores his commitment to bolster the digital asset industry. Higher Fees And Transparency Concerns The implications of opening the retirement market to private equity are vast. Major capital groups, including Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock, have expressed keen interest in gaining access to 401(k) funds, which they view as a potential source of hundreds of billions in new assets. However, the push to integrate less liquid private investments into retirement plans carries inherent risks.

From a technical standpoint, XRP has rallied swiftly since bottoming out on June 22 at around the 1.90 handle. Bitcoin regained bullish momentum, breaking out of consolidation and entering a new price discovery phase, with most supply now in profit. The RSI has twice attempted to break back below the 70 handle which would be a signal of a momentum shift but this has not materialized. By Zain Vawda XRP ( XRP-USD ) has surged around 10% in the last 24 hours and is up around 34% in the past week. XRP continued its rally on Wednesday, briefly reaching $3.30 during Asian trading as optimism grew in the futures market. The token is now just 4% below its all-time high of $3.40, set in 2018. Futures open interest rose to $9.98 billion across major exchanges, a 26% increase in 24 hours and the highest since 2021. High funding rates show traders are heavily betting on price increases, even as the market looks overheated in the short term. Crypto Heatmap - A breakdown of the performance of individual crypto, July 17, 2024 Source: TradingView.com Open interest is the number of active, unsettled futures bets. When prices and open interest both rise, it often shows optimism and expectations of more price gains. Data from WhaleTrace reveals that large investors have bought over 2.2 billion XRP in the last two weeks. This activity lines up with news about leveraged ETFs launching in the U.S. and Grayscale adding XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund. Technical Analysis on Ripple (XRP/USD) From a technical standpoint, XRP has rallied swiftly since bottoming out on June 22 at around the 1.90 handle. The speed of the rally as well as the fact that it is in overbought territory on the RSI mean the possibility of a pullback remains in play. The RSI has twice attempted to break back below the 70 handle which would be a signal of a momentum shift but this has not materialized. Keeping an eye on the RSI may thus be a good indicator for a pullback. The question is whether a pullback will take place before fresh all-time highs are printed or not? Immediate support rests at 3.00 with a break below bringing support at 2.80 into play. Lower down, we have support around the 2.60 handle and the 200-day MA at 2.38.

The move has seen Bitcoin regain bullish momentum with the cost basis distribution heatmap (CBD) showing heavy accumulation in both the $93k-$97k and $104k-$110k zones. Source: Glassnode According to Glassnode on-chain data, a break above these dense supply clusters may now establish strong support for potential pullbacks Bitcoin has already seen a pullback after reaching fresh all-time highs around the $123k handle down to $116k as potential profit taking likely occurred. Glassnode data indicates that Bitcoin is in a new phase of price discovery, with most of its supply now in profit. The current price is above the 95th percentile cost basis level at $107.4k, a key marker for spotting potential market peaks. When prices rise sharply above this level, more investors tend to sell to lock in profits. This can lead to a ""top-heavy"" market, where many investors have bought at higher prices, making them more sensitive to price changes. After hitting a new all-time high of $122.6k, Bitcoin pulled back to $115.9k due to increased selling pressure. This drop happened after the price briefly went above $120k, a level that often acts as resistance during speculative rallies. If momentum stays strong, the next major resistance is at $136k, which aligns with the +2 standard deviation level. Technical Analysis on Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Looking at BTC/USD from a technical perspective, the four-hour chart below and support rests at 117169 provided by the 50-day MA. The recent pullback also failed to break below the 50 neutral level on the RSI period 14 which is serving as support as well. However, a change of structure has taken place with a four-hour candle close below the swing low at 116800. This would hint at a new leg to the downside which could bring support at the 112000 handle into focus.

2025-07-17 21:29:50+00:00,Trump will sign an executive order tomorrow allowing 401(k) plans to invest in crypto,"Donald Trump is getting ready to tear open the gates of America’s retirement savings system. The former president plans to sign an executive order that will let workers pour their 401(k) funds, currently holding over $9 trillion, into crypto, gold, and private equity, according to the Financial Times. This order could land as early as tomorrow and would change where Americans park their retirement money forever. Right now, 401(k) plans mostly stick to the safe, boring stuff (hint, hint: stocks and bonds). But under Trump’s new order, that list is about to get a lot weirder and way more aggressive. The assets in question aren’t just Bitcoin or Ethereum. We’re talking private loans, infrastructure deals, corporate takeover funds, and precious metals too. And to pull it off, the order tells U.S. regulators to figure out what legal roadblocks still stand in the way, so fund managers can start adding these options for retirement savers. Trump expands crypto reach “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future. No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself,” the White House told the Financial Times. Right now, most Americans can only invest their 401(k) contributions into traditional mutual funds tied to public stocks and bonds. But Trump wants to add crypto to the mix… fast. This move builds on his earlier steps: his administration has already backed off from several regulatory crackdowns on crypto exchanges, giving the industry breathing room. Just last Thursday, the House of Representatives passed three bills focused on digital assets. All of them have the full weight of Trump’s support behind them. These bills aim to reduce restrictions on crypto, and they’re part of a wider effort to get blockchain-based finance deep into the heart of the U.S. economy. The reason behind this push isn’t subtle. Trump publicly credits the crypto industry for boosting his chances in the 2024 election. His campaign painted crypto regulations from the Biden era as overkill, and he promised to reverse course. Now, this executive order would make good on that promise. Back in May, the Department of Labor, under Trump’s direction, revoked a rule left over from the Biden administration. That rule warned retirement plan managers to stay away from crypto. With that gone, there’s nothing holding plan providers back from even considering it. Private equity giants gear up to enter the 401(k) market This order would also crack the door wide open for private market players like Blackstone, Apollo, and BlackRock. All three are ready to jump into this pool, and they’ve already started lining up the partnerships they need. If this order becomes official, it will tell the Department of Labor to give plan administrators a legal cushion, a safe harbour, so they won’t get hammered by lawsuits just for offering alternative investments that cost more or aren’t traded on public markets. That’s a big deal. These private assets come with high fees, weird pricing, and very little transparency. But they also carry huge upside, and asset managers want a piece. According to private equity insiders, this one move could push hundreds of billions of dollars into their funds. Blackstone, for instance, is working with Vanguard to distribute its products through retirement accounts. Apollo and Partners Group are doing the same with Empower, which runs one of the country’s largest 401(k) plans. Meanwhile, BlackRock is already working with Great Gray Trust, a third-party retirement plan manager, to bring private funds into savers’ portfolios. For private equity, this order is arriving right on time. Big institutional investors like pensions and endowments haven’t been pouring in new capital like they used to. But 401(k) savers? That’s a whole new source of funding, and there’s a lot of it. Still, none of this comes without risk. These private investments aren’t traded daily. They’re harder to exit, more expensive, and rely heavily on leverage. And there’s not much visibility on what exactly is inside these funds. For regular savers, it’s a totally different ballgame from just buying some index fund. But none of that’s stopping Trump. He wants crypto in your 401k, private equity in your plan statement, and gold in your portfolio. And as usual, he’s going to do what he wants.

Donald Trump is getting ready to tear open the gates of America’s retirement savings system. The former president plans to sign an executive order that will let workers pour their 401(k) funds, currently holding over $9 trillion, into crypto, gold, and private equity, according to the Financial Times. This order could land as early as tomorrow and would change where Americans park their retirement money forever. Right now, 401(k) plans mostly stick to the safe, boring stuff (hint, hint: stocks and bonds). But under Trump’s new order, that list is about to get a lot weirder and way more aggressive. The assets in question aren’t just Bitcoin or Ethereum. We’re talking private loans, infrastructure deals, corporate takeover funds, and precious metals too. And to pull it off, the order tells U.S. regulators to figure out what legal roadblocks still stand in the way, so fund managers can start adding these options for retirement savers. Trump expands crypto reach “President Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future. No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself,” the White House told the Financial Times.

Ether’s price jumped sharply as big and small funds alike funneled fresh money into these products. Related Reading: If You’re Wealthy, 1 Bitcoin Should Already Be In Your Wallet, Expert Says Record Inflows Break Previous Highs According to latest data, US Ethereum spot ETFs saw a single‑day inflow of $727 million yesterday. That smashes the prior record of $428 million set on December 5. The nine funds tracked have now attracted new money every day for eight straight sessions before this surge. Based on reports, this eight‑day streak set the stage for what became the biggest one‑day haul in the ETFs’ history. Big Names Lead The Charge BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) drew nearly $500 illion on Wednesday, pushing its total net inflow to $7.11 billion since launch. The Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) wasn’t far behind, adding $113 million and lifting its cumulative haul to almost $2 billion. Other vehicles chipped in too: Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) hauled in $54 million, the Grayscale Mini Trust added $33 million, and Bitwise’s ETHW ETF contributed $14.5 million. Based on those figures, it’s clear that both institutions and everyday investors are jumping on board across multiple brands. ETF Leaders Dominate New Money Nate Geraci, president of ETF Stores, noted on social media that these ETFs have gathered close to $2 billion over the past five trading days. That pace of inflows shows the growing comfort level big players have with owning Ether through a familiar wrapper. Retail investors often follow institutional moves, so these numbers could spark even more demand. Ethereum Price Climbs Higher Ether’s price has climbed 9% in the last 24 hours, trading at $3,430 at the time of writing. According to market data, that level hasn’t been seen since January 31, when Ether last topped $3,370 before plunging below $1,500.

Both companies will also raise an additional $800 million, which will make the agreement exceed $4 billion. The deal, which is estimated to reach $10 billion by 2025 after combining purchases from Twenty One Capital, will become one of the largest BTC acquisitions to date. As the firm expands its Bitcoin accumulation strategy, BSTR’s founder will receive shares in the leading global financial services and real estate service holding company as part of the deal. Back will act as Chief Executive Officer of BSTR, while Sean Bill, an experienced hedge fund investor, will join the firm as Chief Investment Officer. “By securing both fiat and Bitcoin funding on day one…we are putting unprecedented firepower behind a single mission: maximizing Bitcoin ownership per share while accelerating real-world Bitcoin adoption.” – Adam Back , Co-Founder and CEO of BSTR. The company disclosed in the announcement that 25,000 BTC will be contributed by founding Blockstream Capital Partners shareholders, priced at $10 per share. The rest of the BTC will be issued in-kind PIPE priced at $10 per share. The crypto firm also said that revenue from BSTR will be used to acquire additional Bitcoin and establish digital asset products.

Source: DefiLIama The recent surge in Bitcoin DeFi—often referred to as BTCFi—is also likely due to institutional inflows, new protocol launches, liquid restaking, Bitcoin-backed loans, yield, and more. Institutions Seek a BTCFi Strategy Rena Shah, COO of Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem Trust Machines, told Cryptonews that institutions are finally waking up to the notion that Bitcoin is growing at a faster rate. As a result, the Bitcoin layer-2 ecosystem Stacks recently reported 5,000 sBTC (a 1:1 Bitcoin-backed asset that allows BTC DeFi) bridged in a matter of hours. sBTC Cap-3: Full.

BTCFI is inevitable. pic.twitter.com/iz08KX4ltA — stacks.btc (@Stacks) May 22, 2025 Shah added that the total loan value across the Stacks ecosystem has increased with Bitcoin price appreciation. As Bitcoin is recognized as a form of collateral, Shah believes that institutions will also begin to seek a BTCFi strategy, with many more to follow suit this year. “When everyday users see BTC hit new all-time highs, it creates an opportunity for a second step—Bitcoin DeFi,” Shah said. “The builders who prepared for this moment will have the best opportunity to introduce new users to untapping the full potential of their Bitcoin.” Ben Sanders, chief growth officer at RootstockLabs, also believes this will be the case. Sanders told Cryptonews that in the coming months there will likely be more crypto exchanges and consumer finance apps integrating Bitcoin layers like Rootstock to give users access to BTCFi. “As more institutions build Bitcoin stockpiles, it’s also inevitable that more of them will be looking at ways to put their BTC to work in truly Bitcoin-aligned blockchains like Rootstock,” Sanders stated. Stablecoins Enable Bitcoin DeFi To Surge Sanders further shared that the usage of Rootstock as Bitcoin’s DeFi layer surged in activity. “This is reflected in Rootstock hitting new all-time highs in terms of Total Value Locked and active addresses interacting with the network,” he said.

Bitcoin has long lacked a dominant stable asset, so stablecoin expansion could be a game-changer for Bitcoin DeFi.” This already appears to be the case. Sanders pointed out that two of the biggest use cases on Rootstock currently are Bitcoin borrowing and lending. “We’re seeing both retail users and institutions harnessing Rootstock to generate yield from their BTC holdings, or borrow stablecoins against them. I’ve heard some incredible stories about people financing home renovations and businesses unlocking capital to expand into new markets,” he said. Willem Schroé, CEO and co-founder of Bitcoin layer-2 Botanix Labs, told Cryptonews that Botanix is also experiencing steady growth due to these factors. “As capital flows back into the ecosystem, we’re seeing a surge in interest around Bitcoin-native DeFi, particularly in lending, restaking, and generating yield on BTC,” Schroé said. He added that Botanix has seen steady growth in new users and applications deploying to enable lending, decentralized exchange activity, and Bitcoin Yield.

This is to make it easier for Americans to use Bitcoin and other cryptos on a day-to-day basis. Karoline Leavitt revealed that President Trump has already signaled support for the exemption and that the administration continues to support it. 🚨 The White House is now exploring a de minimis tax exemption for #Bitcoin to make crypto payments easier. That means no more capital gains tax on small BTC transactions. Mass adoption just got one step closer 🇺🇸📲 #Crypto #BTC #Altseason pic.twitter.com/G5hkxlkO3L — PLETHORALLC (@plethorallc) July 17, 2025 “We are definitely receptive to it to make crypto payments easier and more efficient for those who seek to use crypto as simple as buying a cup of coffee,” Leavitt said. “Of course right now that cannot happen, but with the de minimis exemption, perhaps it could in the future, and we will continue to explore legislative solutions to accomplish that.” This would be another win for the crypto industry. However, $600 is still on the higher side. Earlier this month, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation to reform US crypto taxation. She aims to exempt transactions under $300 and alter the tax implications for mined or staked crypto. Trump’s office to hold a signing ceremony The House passed three major crypto bills on Thursday, locking in a rare legislative win for the industry. In what’s now the biggest regulatory overhaul for crypto so far, lawmakers voted on the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and the CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act. Leavitt added that the bill was very important to keeping Trump’s campaign promise. “This piece of legislation is going to make America the crypto capital of the world, and that’s what the president promised,” she said. The GENIUS Act is mostly about regulating stablecoins. On the other hand, the CLARITY Act makes it clear that the SEC and CFTC will be responsible for different types of digital commodities, like Bitcoin. Meanwhile, some Democrats are still criticizing the bill for creating what they see as an overly weak regulatory framework that could pose long-term financial risks. They’ve also raised concerns that the legislation opens the door for major corporations to issue their own private crypto tokens. “If this bill passes, it will allow Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg to issue their own money. The bill still permits Big Tech companies and other conglomerates to issue their own private currencies,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The Anti-CBDC Act says that the Federal Reserve can’t make a digital currency that is used by the whole country. The press secretary reiterated Trump’s opposition to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). She noted that he signed an executive order in January prohibiting its development. Leavitt said more crypto legislation will emerge from Capitol Hill. “The administration supports Congress’s efforts to codify that executive order into law, and I believe there will be future pieces of legislation in regards to crypto that will be moving through Capitol Hill,” she said. Bitcoin mining remains an issue Senator Cynthia Lummis recently unveiled a digital asset tax reform draft that addresses these Bitcoin issues. The one that is yet to be addressed is that the IRS doesn’t see it as a product. The IRS usually only taxes people who make goods at the point of sale.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration is looking into a de minimis tax exemption for Bitcoin transactions under $600. This is to make it easier for Americans to use Bitcoin and other cryptos on a day-to-day basis. Karoline Leavitt revealed that President Trump has already signaled support for the exemption and that the administration continues to support it. 🚨 The White House is now exploring a de minimis tax exemption for #Bitcoin to make crypto payments easier. That means no more capital gains tax on small BTC transactions. Mass adoption just got one step closer 🇺🇸📲 #Crypto #BTC #Altseason pic.twitter.com/G5hkxlkO3L — PLETHORALLC (@plethorallc) July 17, 2025 “We are definitely receptive to it to make crypto payments easier and more efficient for those who seek to use crypto as simple as buying a cup of coffee,” Leavitt said. “Of course right now that cannot happen, but with the de minimis exemption, perhaps it could in the future, and we will continue to explore legislative solutions to accomplish that.” This would be another win for the crypto industry. However, $600 is still on the higher side. Earlier this month, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation to reform US crypto taxation. She aims to exempt transactions under $300 and alter the tax implications for mined or staked crypto.

Saqib views El Salvador as a model for digital transformation in a resource-constrained environment. Other areas of collaboration include blockchain-based financial inclusion and the development of crypto policies for emerging economies. The agreement was signed in San Salvador during a meeting between Bilal bin Saqib, Chairman of the Pakistan Cryptocurrency Council (PCC) and Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain, and Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador. In addition to advancing Bitcoin adoption, both countries agreed to collaborate on blockchain-based financial inclusion and the development of crypto policies for emerging economies. The Letter of Intent they signed outlines joint efforts to promote the public adoption of Bitcoin, expand financial inclusion, and foster supportive regulatory frameworks. The official discussions centered on leveraging El Salvador’s experience as a model for countries with limited resources but ambitious plans for digital transformation. Saqib emphasized the importance of seizing the moment, stating that emerging economies need not wait—they can embrace blockchain and cryptotechnology now, guided by Bukele’s example. Crypto-Reserves: Digital Assets as Strategic State Reserves El Salvador, despite ongoing criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), continues to actively accumulate Bitcoin.

2025-07-17 23:00:37+00:00,Digi Power X: A Tiny Stock With A Big Super Micro Bet,"Summary Digi Power X Inc.’s purchase of Nvidia B200 systems marks a real shift from hype to execution, powering their NeoCloud AI platform and driving stock momentum. The company’s hybrid model—bitcoin mining, energy sales, and AI-ready modular data pods—offers multiple revenue streams, not just future promises. DGXX stock valuation is stretched, with negative margins and high volatility due to retail-heavy ownership, making this a high-risk, high-reward momentum play. Despite big red flags like ongoing losses and crypto dependency, DGXX could explode if it delivers; I’d treat it like a speculative call option. Introduction The July 17th move in Digi Power X Inc. ( DGXX ) wasn’t just another microcap spike on vague promises. This time, the company placed an actual purchase order with Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) for Nvidia (NVDA) B200 (Blackwell) systems, which will power their new AI platform called NeoCloud. The stock exploded over 30% in premarket and held on to a solid 7.5% gain by market close. And I think that reaction makes sense, because it’s not a future promise; it’s an actual, active move in the right direction. About Digi Power X DGXX is easy to dismiss because it sounds like a buzzword smoothie. It’s a small-cap stock with crypto exposure, modular pods, energy, and AI. But take a second look, and it starts to get more interesting. They are mining bitcoin, but it’s not as straightforward as you might think. They’re setting up Tier 3-level, AI-ready data infrastructure. Portable modular pods (ARMS 200s) that can be deployed without needing to build a hyperscale facility from scratch. That’s the idea behind their NeoCloud platform. And even before all this AI talk, DGXX was already running a business. They’ve got about 100MW of active capacity spread across three locations, with plans to scale up to 200MW or more. They’re mining bitcoin, hosting third-party miners, reselling energy, stacking solar credits in New York, and considering battery storage in Buffalo (maybe they are doing more, but this is what I have found). They even have some cash flow from it. Revenue (Seeking Alpha) Super Micro Deal The first time you could hear about Super Micro and Digi Power X relations was back in May, something about their subsidiary working on a GPU rack deployment. At the time, the stock jumped 15% premarket on the news, but it wasn’t as important because this time it was a definitive order. Nvidia B200s are being installed into their modular pods, and we will most likely see the rollout already in the fourth quarter. This is what changes things. For the first time, it feels like this company is determined to work hard and achieve its goals. The main goal, as you will see in the quote below, is to bring in Tier 3 AI compute. Besides, it’s a good sign they ordered the best to make it work—Blackwell B200s. With Supermicro’s advanced B200 systems, we are now taking the steps to transition from infrastructure buildout to revenue generation. Our goal is to deliver Tier 3 AI-ready capacity equipped with the world’s most powerful GPUs for the generative AI era. Crypto and Energy Most of the money comes from crypto and energy. In May, DGXX brought in around $4.3 million from bitcoin mining and energy sales. They mined 35 BTC that month. By the end of June, the total crypto and cash balance jumped 45% in a month to $13.5 million. Q2 energy revenue hit $2.3 million, and they’re stacking extra value from side projects like a solar site in New York and potential battery integration. These are things most people aren’t looking at when they glance at the stock, but it’s good because it means they’re not depending entirely on one future launch. They’ve already got multiple revenue streams, which, hopefully, will only grow over time. Valuation Look, I’m not going to sugarcoat this; the valuation is way ahead of the fundamentals. P/B close to 5x, P/S around 3x, no earnings, negative margins—if you’re looking for a safe entry, this isn’t it. But sometimes valuation doesn’t tell the whole story, especially with early-stage companies chasing multiple fast-growing markets. Valuation (Seeking Alpha) The Super Micro deal makes it more interesting because there is an actual deployment scheduled. And there’s already revenue from bitcoin and from energy. Besides the valuation, I noticed that ownership is mostly in the hands of individual investors (about 67% + almost 14% by individuals/insiders). That kind of ownership structure creates a very specific type of market behavior, like we saw today. Volatility on any sentiment and headline, and not necessarily on fundamentals. Ownership (Seeking Alpha) If you’ve followed enough smallcaps before, you know how this works. When a company with a retail-heavy float announces something big (very much like a deal with Super Micro) or anything with Nvidia’s name in it, the stock doesn’t just go up 2–3%; it can fly 30%. Hello, DGXX, today on the premarket. But it works both ways. That same setup ",seekingalpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802098-digi-power-x-a-tiny-stock-with-a-big-super-micro-bet?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,BUSINESS|BTC|MINING|MARKET|TRADING,SMCI|SMCI:CA|NVDA|NVDA:CA|BTC-USD|DGXX|DGX:CA,BTC,"Digi Power X: A Tiny Stock With A Big Super Micro Bet.

Q2 energy revenue hit $2.3 million, and they’re stacking extra value from side projects like a solar site in New York and potential battery integration. These are things most people aren’t looking at when they glance at the stock, but it’s good because it means they’re not depending entirely on one future launch. They’ve already got multiple revenue streams, which, hopefully, will only grow over time. Valuation Look, I’m not going to sugarcoat this; the valuation is way ahead of the fundamentals. P/B close to 5x, P/S around 3x, no earnings, negative margins—if you’re looking for a safe entry, this isn’t it. But sometimes valuation doesn’t tell the whole story, especially with early-stage companies chasing multiple fast-growing markets. Valuation (Seeking Alpha) The Super Micro deal makes it more interesting because there is an actual deployment scheduled. And there’s already revenue from bitcoin and from energy. Besides the valuation, I noticed that ownership is mostly in the hands of individual investors (about 67% + almost 14% by individuals/insiders). That kind of ownership structure creates a very specific type of market behavior, like we saw today. Volatility on any sentiment and headline, and not necessarily on fundamentals. Ownership (Seeking Alpha) If you’ve followed enough smallcaps before, you know how this works. When a company with a retail-heavy float announces something big (very much like a deal with Super Micro) or anything with Nvidia’s name in it, the stock doesn’t just go up 2–3%; it can fly 30%. Hello, DGXX, today on the premarket. But it works both ways. That same setup"

Imagine a publicly traded company, a titan like Enlightify Inc., making a direct, substantial commitment to a specific crypto asset. This isn’t just a hypothetical scenario; it’s the groundbreaking reality announced by the Cyber Foundation (CYBER), revealing Enlightify’s strategic decision to acquire up to $20 million worth of CYBER tokens over the next year. This bold move isn’t just news; it’s a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of digital finance. Unpacking the Significance of the CYBER Token Before delving deeper into the investment, it’s essential to understand what makes the CYBER token a compelling asset. CYBER is the native token of Cyber, a decentralized social graph protocol that aims to empower users with true ownership of their digital identities and content. In an increasingly digital world, where platforms often control user data, Cyber offers a decentralized alternative, giving power back to the individual. This focus on user-centricity and data ownership resonates deeply with the core principles of Web3. The protocol facilitates the creation of a universal identity layer, allowing users to move their social connections and content across different decentralized applications seamlessly. This utility positions CYBER not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational component for a more open and equitable internet. Enlightify’s interest likely stems from this long-term vision and the practical application of the Cyber protocol in the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem. The Landmark Enlightify Investment: What It Means Enlightify Inc. (NYSE: ENFY), a publicly traded entity, has announced its intention to acquire up to $20 million worth of CYBER tokens over the next 12 months. This is a monumental development for several reasons: First-of-its-Kind Commitment: This marks the first time a publicly traded company has explicitly committed a significant portion of its treasury funds directly to CYBER. It sets a precedent for how traditional corporations might engage with specialized crypto assets. Strategic Alignment: The investment follows Enlightify’s strategic realignment of its subsidiary, Antaeus Tech, to focus specifically on blockchain initiatives. This isn’t a speculative gamble but a calculated move aligning with their broader technological vision. Long-Term Confidence: The 12-month acquisition window indicates a long-term perspective rather than a short-term trade. It suggests Enlightify sees sustained value and growth potential in the Cyber ecosystem. This Enlightify investment is not merely a financial transaction; it’s a vote of confidence from the traditional financial world in the utility and future of decentralized protocols. Rising Tide: The Era of Institutional Crypto Adoption For years, cryptocurrency was largely seen as a retail-driven phenomenon, often viewed with skepticism by large financial institutions. However, that narrative has been steadily changing. We are now witnessing a clear and accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption . This shift is driven by several factors: Maturing Market Infrastructure: The development of regulated custody solutions, derivatives markets, and clearer regulatory frameworks has made crypto more accessible and less risky for institutions. Inflationary Hedges and Diversification: In an era of economic uncertainty, institutions are exploring alternative assets that can offer diversification and potential hedges against traditional market volatility. Technological Innovation: Beyond just Bitcoin, institutions are recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology across various sectors, from finance to supply chain management and digital identity. Enlightify’s move with CYBER is a powerful testament to this growing institutional comfort and strategic engagement with digital assets, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to more specialized tokens. Why Specialized Blockchain Networks Are Gaining Traction While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain cornerstones of the crypto market, a new wave of interest is focusing on specialized blockchain networks . These networks are designed for specific purposes, offering optimized performance, scalability, and unique functionalities tailored to particular use cases.

They will also include introductory guides designed for first-time crypto investors. Shinhan Bank: Crypto Services Debut While the new functions will not yet allow Shinhan customers to buy or sell crypto directly via the SOL app, the move is a significant bullish step for the financial behemoth. Shinhan Financial Group share prices over the past three months. (Source: Naver Finance) No other domestic bank has yet launched a similar service, although some are thought to be working on crypto-related projects. Currently, only five domestic crypto exchanges have obtained the necessary permits to offer KRW-crypto pairings. Banks are not yet allowed to offer crypto exchange services. However, some (including Shinhan) have previously explored the possibility of launching crypto custody services. The new SOL crypto resources include a real-time crypto price monitoring tool, introductory guides and quizzes for beginner investors, and a professional crypto-related reporting and news service. SOL Bank is Shinhan’s smart banking, financial services, and investment platform.

Shinhan added that it wants to help customers make information-based investments. It said it hopes to provide easy-to-understand materials for customers who are not familiar with the crypto scene, while also “protecting consumers.” But the bank has already indicated that it is prepared to go a step further in the near future, by integrating some functions with its crypto exchange partner Korbit.

2025-07-17 23:30:45+00:00,Analyst Forecasts Shiba Inu (SHIB) 130% Surge,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme-based cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of renewed strength following a prolonged period of underperformance. During its recent price recovery, a prominent analyst, known as GehavianGoals, has outlined a bullish outlook for the asset, projecting a potential rally of over 130% from its current value. Market Performance and Recent Recovery Since reaching a high of $0.0000334 in December 2024, Shiba Inu has declined significantly, dropping as low as $0.00001004 by June 2025, a correction of approximately 69%. This decline occurred even as Bitcoin recorded multiple all-time highs, underscoring a divergence in momentum between the two assets during the same timeframe. However, SHIB has recently begun reversing its downward trend. The token has appreciated by 14.51% over the past week and gained an additional 1.67% in the last 24 hours, suggesting that investor sentiment is beginning to shift. Despite these gains, SHIB remains 31% below its price at the start of the year. Technical Outlook and Support Levels In his recent analysis, GehavianGoals noted that Shiba Inu is showing signs of maintaining its upward trajectory. He identified key support levels where the asset has repeatedly rebounded, describing these areas as strong demand zones. SHIB has tested this zone several times throughout 2024 and 2025, with each test resulting in price rejections and a move higher. The most recent retests of the $0.000011 support zone occurred on February 3, March 11, April 7, and June 22. These consistent rejections of lower price levels reinforce the area’s importance as a base for potential rallies. Historically, Shiba Inu has surged significantly from this level, most notably in early 2024 when it climbed to a high of $0.00004567 before facing resistance and pulling back. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Entry Points and Price Targets The analyst shared specific buy zones to consider, with the first identified at $0.00001092, a level that SHIB has already surpassed. Another entry point is projected around $0.0000188, which is approximately 31% above the current price level. GehavianGoals has set a target of $0.00003352, representing a 130% increase from current market prices. If calculated from his initial entry at $0.00001092, the potential upside rises to 206%. While he did not offer a specific timeframe for reaching this target, he emphasized that he is prepared to hold his position for up to two years if necessary. The analyst’s bullish stance aligns with broader market sentiment within the SHIB community. Several observers believe that Shiba Inu could revisit higher price ranges if it overcomes resistance levels tied to high-volume trading clusters. A recent study also supported the view that SHIB could reclaim the $0.000035 price region under favourable technical conditions. Despite past volatility, analysts and investors are increasingly optimistic about Shiba Inu’s medium to long-term prospects , and recent technical signals suggest momentum may be returning to the asset.

2025-07-17 23:40:55+00:00,Ethereum Shift: BTC Digital’s Bold Pivot to ETH Staking and DeFi Growth,"BitcoinWorld Ethereum Shift: BTC Digital’s Bold Pivot to ETH Staking and DeFi Growth The cryptocurrency landscape is in a constant state of flux, with companies making pivotal decisions to navigate its dynamic tides and capitalize on emerging opportunities. One such groundbreaking announcement comes from BTC Digital (NASDAQ: BTCT), a name previously synonymous with Bitcoin. The company has now declared a monumental Ethereum shift , signaling a profound strategic reorientation that will see it move away from its Bitcoin-centric operations to fully embrace the vibrant and versatile Ethereum ecosystem. The Strategic Rationale: Why This Revolutionary Ethereum Shift? BTC Digital ‘s decision to undergo a complete Ethereum shift is far more than a simple asset reallocation; it’s a fundamental re-alignment of its core business strategy. For years, Bitcoin has been celebrated as ‘digital gold,’ a premier store of value and a foundational cryptocurrency. However, the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, the rapidly expanding landscape of real-world assets (RWA) on-chain, and the lucrative potential of staking demand a more versatile, programmable blockchain. Ethereum, with its robust smart contract capabilities, extensive developer community, and the recent transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), offers precisely that. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and a store of value, Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications (dApps). This distinction is crucial for a company like BTC Digital, which seeks to engage actively in complex financial protocols and asset tokenization rather than just holding a digital commodity. Ethereum’s programmability allows for the creation of intricate financial instruments, automated agreements, and new forms of digital ownership, making it the ideal foundation for their ambitious new ventures. Furthermore, Ethereum’s PoS consensus mechanism, implemented with ‘The Merge,’ has paved the way for attractive staking yields, offering a new, sustainable revenue stream that was not inherently available with Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) model without significant energy consumption for mining. This economic incentive, combined with Ethereum’s network effects and ongoing scalability improvements (like Layer 2 solutions), makes it a compelling choice for forward-thinking crypto enterprises. BTC Digital’s Ambitious Vision: From BTC to ETH Dominance This bold move by BTC Digital involves a complete conversion of its existing Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum. As reported by Stock Titan, the company aims to significantly grow its ETH reserves, targeting tens of millions of dollars by year-end. This substantial financial commitment, backed by $6 million in recent funding, underscores the seriousness and scale of their strategic reorientation. It’s a clear statement of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential and its central role in the future of decentralized finance. The transition signifies a shift from a capital-intensive mining operation, which often faces volatile energy costs and hardware depreciation, to an asset management and yield-generation model. By holding and deploying significant amounts of ETH, BTC Digital positions itself to participate directly in the network’s security and economic activity, rather than merely validating transactions through mining rigs. This pivot also implies a more diversified approach to revenue generation, moving beyond block rewards to encompass staking yields, DeFi protocol fees, and potential earnings from RWA initiatives. To better illustrate this profound transformation, consider the following comparison: Aspect Previous Strategy (Bitcoin-centric) New Strategy (Ethereum-driven) Primary Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Core Activity Mining Operations Staking, DeFi, RWA Initiatives Ecosystem Focus Store of Value, Transaction Processing Programmable Money, Smart Contracts, Decentralized Applications Revenue Streams Block Rewards, Transaction Fees (from mining) Staking Yields, DeFi Protocol Fees, RWA Tokenization & Yields Operational Overhead High (energy, hardware, maintenance) Lower (primarily digital asset management) Harnessing Passive Income: The Power of ETH Staking A cornerstone of BTC Digital ‘s new strategy is a deep dive into ETH staking . With Ethereum’s successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking has become a crucial mechanism for securing the network while simultaneously offering participants a passive income stream. By staking their substantial ETH holdings, BTC Digital aims to generate consistent yields, thereby diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional mining operations. Staking involves locking up ETH to support the network’s operations, including validating transactions and proposing new blocks. In return, stakers receive rewards in ETH.

To better illustrate this profound transformation, consider the following comparison: Aspect Previous Strategy (Bitcoin-centric) New Strategy (Ethereum-driven) Primary Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Core Activity Mining Operations Staking, DeFi, RWA Initiatives Ecosystem Focus Store of Value, Transaction Processing Programmable Money, Smart Contracts, Decentralized Applications Revenue Streams Block Rewards, Transaction Fees (from mining) Staking Yields, DeFi Protocol Fees, RWA Tokenization & Yields Operational Overhead High (energy, hardware, maintenance) Lower (primarily digital asset management) Harnessing Passive Income: The Power of ETH Staking A cornerstone of BTC Digital ‘s new strategy is a deep dive into ETH staking . With Ethereum’s successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking has become a crucial mechanism for securing the network while simultaneously offering participants a passive income stream. By staking their substantial ETH holdings, BTC Digital aims to generate consistent yields, thereby diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional mining operations. Staking involves locking up ETH to support the network’s operations, including validating transactions and proposing new blocks. In return, stakers receive rewards in ETH. This mechanism not only contributes to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain but"

Prepare for a major one: BSTR Holdings has just completed a monumental merger agreement with Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO), a move poised to reshape the institutional crypto investment space. This isn’t just another corporate handshake; it’s the birth of a formidable new player, set to become one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin globally. What Does the BSTR Merger Mean for the Crypto World? The finalization of the merger agreement between BSTR Holdings and Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO) marks a pivotal moment for both entities and the broader digital asset ecosystem. This strategic alliance isn’t merely a corporate restructuring; it’s a bold declaration of intent from traditional finance to deeply engage with the cryptocurrency market. The newly combined company, set to trade under the ticker “BSTR,” is designed to leverage the strengths of both parties: BSTR’s vision for Bitcoin-native financial products and Cantor Equity Partners’ extensive experience in capital markets and institutional reach. For years, the crypto space has yearned for greater institutional adoption. This merger serves as a powerful testament to that growing trend. It signifies that major players in traditional finance are not just observing but actively participating in shaping the future of digital assets. The combined entity aims to bridge the gap between conventional investment vehicles and the innovative potential of Bitcoin, paving the way for more sophisticated financial products and broader market access. How Will BSTR’s Bitcoin Treasury Impact the Market? One of the most striking aspects of this merger is the immediate establishment of BSTR as a significant holder of Bitcoin. With a formidable 30,021 Bitcoin (BTC) in its treasury, BSTR is poised to become the fourth-largest public Bitcoin treasury globally. This is a staggering amount that places it in an elite league alongside established names like MicroStrategy. But what does this mean for the market? Increased Institutional Demand: A large, publicly traded company holding such a substantial amount of BTC signals strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. This could encourage other corporations and institutional investors to follow suit, potentially driving further demand. Market Stability: Large, stable holders like BSTR can contribute to market stability by reducing the available supply in circulation, which might lessen volatility compared to speculative trading. Benchmarking: BSTR’s performance and strategic decisions regarding its Bitcoin treasury will likely be closely watched by analysts and investors, potentially setting new benchmarks for corporate Bitcoin adoption strategies. This substantial Bitcoin treasury is not just a static holding; it forms the very foundation upon which BSTR plans to build its future endeavors, particularly its ambitious plans for crypto investment products. The Strategic Alliance: Why Cantor Equity Partners is a Game Changer The involvement of Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO) is a critical component of this merger’s significance. Cantor Fitzgerald, its parent company, is a venerable name in financial services, with a history spanning nearly a century. Their expertise in investment banking, prime brokerage, and capital markets brings a level of legitimacy and operational sophistication that is invaluable for a crypto-focused entity. This alliance offers several key advantages: Credibility and Trust: Cantor’s established reputation can help instill greater confidence among institutional investors who might still be hesitant about the nascent crypto market. Access to Capital: Their network and experience are crucial for facilitating the massive PIPE financing BSTR is undertaking, ensuring the capital needed for growth and further Bitcoin acquisition. Regulatory Navigation: Traditional finance firms often possess a deeper understanding of complex regulatory landscapes, which is vital for navigating the evolving rules governing digital assets. Product Development Expertise: Cantor’s experience in developing and distributing a wide range of financial products will be instrumental in BSTR’s creation of BTC-native capital market offerings. This partnership exemplifies a growing trend where traditional financial giants are not just observing the crypto space but actively integrating it into their core strategies, acknowledging Bitcoin’s enduring presence and potential. Unlocking Growth: The Power of $1.5 Billion in PIPE Financing Beyond its initial Bitcoin holdings, BSTR’s strategy includes raising up to $1.5 billion in Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) financing.

2025-07-18 00:00:48+00:00,Bitcoin Treasuries Soar: Unveiling the Astounding H1 2025 Crypto Market Shift,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Treasuries Soar: Unveiling the Astounding H1 2025 Crypto Market Shift The first half of 2025 has painted a fascinating picture of the cryptocurrency landscape, one dominated by two powerful forces: Bitcoin and stablecoins. A recent report from K33 sheds crucial light on these shifting dynamics, revealing a significant surge in Bitcoin treasuries held by public companies and a remarkable expansion in the overall stablecoin supply . This isn’t just a fleeting trend; it signals a profound evolution in how institutions and individuals perceive and utilize digital assets. Why Are Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries Exploding? According to the K33 report, public companies made a colossal move in H1 2025, adding nearly 245,000 BTC to their balance sheets. This isn’t merely an increase in volume; the number of firms embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset nearly doubled, soaring from 70 to 134 across 27 countries. The United States, predictably, leads this charge, demonstrating a growing conviction among corporate giants in the long-term value proposition of the world’s leading cryptocurrency. But why are companies making such a bold shift? Several factors are at play: Inflation Hedge: In an era of persistent inflationary concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold, offering a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Balance Sheet Diversification: Forward-thinking companies are looking beyond traditional assets to diversify their treasury holdings, recognizing Bitcoin’s uncorrelated nature to conventional markets. Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions, payment processors, and investment funds embrace Bitcoin, the perceived risk decreases, making it more palatable for corporate treasuries. Future-Proofing: Holding Bitcoin can be seen as a strategic move to align with the future of finance, positioning companies at the forefront of digital innovation. This surge in Bitcoin treasuries underscores a maturing market where institutional confidence is not just a buzzword, but a tangible reality shaping corporate financial strategies globally. The Stablecoin Supply Surge: A Pillar of Crypto Stability? While Bitcoin’s institutional embrace captures headlines, the quiet but relentless growth of the stablecoin supply is equally significant. The K33 report highlights an impressive $38 billion increase in stablecoin supply during H1 2025. These digital assets, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, play a pivotal role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins serve multiple critical functions: Trading Pairs: They are the primary trading pairs for most cryptocurrencies, facilitating seamless and efficient transactions across exchanges without the need to convert back to fiat. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities with reduced volatility risk. Remittances and Payments: Their stability and speed make them attractive for cross-border payments and remittances, offering a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional banking rails. Safe Haven: During periods of market volatility, traders often convert their volatile crypto assets into stablecoins, using them as a temporary safe haven. The consistent expansion of the stablecoin supply signals robust activity within the crypto economy, reflecting increased liquidity and utility across various applications. It suggests a growing comfort level with digital dollars as a medium of exchange and value storage. Altcoin Performance: A Clear Sign of Crypto Market Dominance In stark contrast to the bullish narratives surrounding Bitcoin and stablecoins, the K33 report reveals a challenging period for most altcoins. Out of the top 50 alternative cryptocurrencies, a mere nine managed to post gains in H1 2025. This divergence paints a clear picture of the prevailing crypto market dominance by Bitcoin and the increasing preference for stable, liquid assets. This performance disparity highlights a ‘flight to quality’ phenomenon. When market sentiment becomes cautious, or when major catalysts like institutional adoption are in play, capital tends to consolidate into Bitcoin, perceived as the most secure and established digital asset. Many altcoins, often lacking the same level of liquidity, institutional backing, or proven use cases, struggle to attract investment in such an environment. For investors, this trend underscores the importance of understanding market cycles and the varying risk profiles within the crypto space. While altcoins can offer explosive growth potential, they also carry significantly higher risk, especially when Bitcoin asserts its dominance. What Lies Ahead?

2025-07-18 01:10:18+00:00,"Bitcoin Mystery: Massive 7,880 BTC Transfer Stuns Crypto World","BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mystery: Massive 7,880 BTC Transfer Stuns Crypto World The cryptocurrency world was recently abuzz with news of a colossal Bitcoin transfer that sent ripples of speculation across the market. Imagine nearly a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, a staggering 7,880 BTC, suddenly shifting from one of the most recognized exchanges, Coinbase, into an anonymous digital abyss. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a headline-grabbing event that raises numerous questions and keeps market watchers on edge. What does such a massive BTC movement signify for the broader crypto landscape? Decoding the Unprecedented Bitcoin Transfer The news broke courtesy of Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service renowned for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report highlighted the movement of 7,880 BTC from a known Coinbase wallet to an entirely new, previously unseen address. At the time of the transaction, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $934 million. To put that into perspective, it’s enough to buy a small fleet of private jets or fund significant development projects. Such a substantial Bitcoin transfer immediately signals the involvement of a major player, commonly referred to as a ‘crypto whale’. These are entities or individuals holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, and their movements often precede or influence market trends. The sheer size of this particular transfer makes it a focal point for analysis, as it could have profound implications for market liquidity, sentiment, and even future price action. Who is the Mysterious Crypto Whale Behind This Move? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, the immediate question on everyone’s mind is: who is behind it? While the blockchain transaction itself is transparent and publicly verifiable, the identity of the wallet owner remains shrouded in anonymity. This is the inherent design of many cryptocurrencies – transactions are public, but identities are private unless voluntarily disclosed or linked through external means. So, who could this crypto whale be? Several theories are circulating: Institutional Investor: A large institution, such as a hedge fund, an asset management firm, or even a corporation adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, might be accumulating a significant position. Moving funds off an exchange to cold storage is a common practice for long-term holding. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The transfer could be part of a large OTC trade, where a buyer and seller execute a transaction directly, often facilitated by a broker, to avoid impacting exchange order books with such a large volume. The funds are then moved to the buyer’s private wallet. Exchange Rebalancing: Less likely for a move to an ‘unknown new wallet’, but sometimes exchanges move funds between their own cold and hot wallets for security or operational reasons. However, the ‘unknown new wallet’ aspect points away from this being an internal Coinbase move. High-Net-Worth Individual: A very wealthy individual could be consolidating their holdings or preparing for a major private transaction. Preparation for Custody Solution: The funds might be moving to a specialized crypto custody provider, which offers enhanced security features for institutional-grade holdings. The fact that the funds moved from Coinbase , a regulated and prominent exchange, suggests a degree of legitimacy and potentially a US-based or compliant entity, although this is not definitive proof. Why Coinbase and BTC Movement Matter So Much The choice of Coinbase as the origin point for such a massive BTC movement is significant. Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally, particularly in the Western world. When large sums of Bitcoin leave an exchange, it typically has a few potential interpretations: Reduced Selling Pressure: If Bitcoin is moved off an exchange into a private wallet, it’s often interpreted as a sign that the holder intends to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell in the immediate future. This can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Long-Term Accumulation: Large withdrawals often indicate accumulation by long-term investors or institutions who prefer to self-custody their assets rather than leaving them on an exchange, which carries counterparty risk. Preparation for Private Sale: As mentioned, it could be a precursor to an OTC deal, where the buyer receives the BTC directly into their private wallet.

BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Mystery: Massive 7,880 BTC Transfer Stuns Crypto World The cryptocurrency world was recently abuzz with news of a colossal Bitcoin transfer that sent ripples of speculation across the market. Imagine nearly a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, a staggering 7,880 BTC, suddenly shifting from one of the most recognized exchanges, Coinbase, into an anonymous digital abyss. This isn’t just a routine transaction; it’s a headline-grabbing event that raises numerous questions and keeps market watchers on edge. What does such a massive BTC movement signify for the broader crypto landscape? Decoding the Unprecedented Bitcoin Transfer The news broke courtesy of Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service renowned for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report highlighted the movement of 7,880 BTC from a known Coinbase wallet to an entirely new, previously unseen address. At the time of the transaction, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $934 million. To put that into perspective, it’s enough to buy a small fleet of private jets or fund significant development projects. Such a substantial Bitcoin transfer immediately signals the involvement of a major player, commonly referred to as a ‘crypto whale’. These are entities or individuals holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, and their movements often precede or influence market trends. The sheer size of this particular transfer makes it a focal point for analysis, as it could have profound implications for market liquidity, sentiment, and even future price action. Who is the Mysterious Crypto Whale Behind This Move? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, the immediate question on everyone’s mind is: who is behind it? While the blockchain transaction itself is transparent and publicly verifiable, the identity of the wallet owner remains shrouded in anonymity. This is the inherent design of many cryptocurrencies – transactions are public, but identities are private unless voluntarily disclosed or linked through external means. So, who could this crypto whale be? Several theories are circulating: Institutional Investor: A large institution, such as a hedge fund, an asset management firm, or even a corporation adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, might be accumulating a significant position. Moving funds off an exchange to cold storage is a common practice for long-term holding. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The transfer could be part of a large OTC trade, where a buyer and seller execute a transaction directly, often facilitated by a broker, to avoid impacting exchange order books with such a large volume. The funds are then moved to the buyer’s private wallet. Exchange Rebalancing: Less likely for a move to an ‘unknown new wallet’, but sometimes exchanges move funds between their own cold and hot wallets for security or operational reasons. However, the ‘unknown new wallet’ aspect points away from this being an internal Coinbase move. High-Net-Worth Individual: A very wealthy individual could be consolidating their holdings or preparing for a major private transaction. Preparation for Custody Solution: The funds might be moving to a specialized crypto custody provider, which offers enhanced security features for institutional-grade holdings. The fact that the funds moved from Coinbase , a regulated and prominent exchange, suggests a degree of legitimacy and potentially a US-based or compliant entity, although this is not definitive proof. Why Coinbase and BTC Movement Matter So Much The choice of Coinbase as the origin point for such a massive BTC movement is significant. Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally, particularly in the Western world. When large sums of Bitcoin leave an exchange, it typically has a few potential interpretations: Reduced Selling Pressure: If Bitcoin is moved off an exchange into a private wallet, it’s often interpreted as a sign that the holder intends to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell in the immediate future. This can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Long-Term Accumulation: Large withdrawals often indicate accumulation by long-term investors or institutions who prefer to self-custody their assets rather than leaving them on an exchange, which carries counterparty risk. Preparation for Private Sale: As mentioned, it could be a precursor to an OTC deal, where the buyer receives the BTC directly into their private wallet. Conversely, large inflows of Bitcoin to exchanges often signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing selling pressure. Therefore, this particular outflow is generally seen as a bullish or neutral signal, indicating long-term conviction rather than immediate liquidation.

2025-07-18 01:20:15+00:00,Unlocking Potential: Nasdaq’s Pivotal Ethereum ETF Staking Proposal,"BitcoinWorld Unlocking Potential: Nasdaq’s Pivotal Ethereum ETF Staking Proposal A truly significant moment is unfolding in the world of digital assets, one that could redefine how institutional investors engage with cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq, a titan in the financial exchange industry, has submitted a groundbreaking proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to add staking capabilities to the iShares Ethereum Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). This isn’t just another filing; it’s a bold move that signals a growing convergence between traditional finance and the innovative realm of blockchain, particularly impacting the future of Ethereum ETF products. What is the Nasdaq Proposal and Why Does it Matter for the Ethereum ETF Landscape? At its core, the Nasdaq proposal seeks to enable the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, managed by BlackRock, to engage in crypto staking activities. Currently, many proposed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs focus solely on holding the underlying asset. However, this new filing introduces a layer of yield generation, allowing the ETF to earn rewards by participating in the Ethereum network’s proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This is a monumental shift because it could potentially offer investors not just exposure to Ethereum’s price movements, but also an additional income stream, mirroring how traditional financial instruments like bonds or dividend stocks provide returns. The proposal outlines how the Trust would utilize one or more trusted staking providers, such as Coinbase Custody, to facilitate the staking process. The rewards generated from staking would then accrue to the Trust, potentially enhancing its overall performance. This innovative approach aims to make the ETF more attractive by leveraging the native yield capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain, a feature previously accessible primarily to direct holders of Ether (ETH). Demystifying Crypto Staking: How Does it Work for iShares Ethereum Trust? For those new to the concept, crypto staking is a fundamental process in proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum. Instead of relying on energy-intensive mining (as Bitcoin does), Ethereum validators lock up a certain amount of their Ether as collateral to help secure the network and validate transactions. In return for this service, they receive rewards in the form of newly minted Ether and transaction fees. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how staking works and its relevance to the iShares Ethereum Trust proposal: Proof-of-Stake (PoS): Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to PoS with the ‘Merge’ in September 2022. This change made staking possible. Validators: Individuals or entities who ‘stake’ their ETH to participate in block validation. A full validator requires 32 ETH. Staking Rewards: Validators earn ETH rewards for successfully proposing and attesting to blocks. These rewards incentivize network security and participation. Slashing: A penalty mechanism where a portion of a validator’s staked ETH is forfeited if they act maliciously or fail to perform their duties correctly. This risk is a key consideration for institutional staking. The Nasdaq proposal addresses these intricacies by suggesting the use of reputable third-party staking providers. These providers handle the technical complexities, manage validator operations, and mitigate risks like slashing, making it feasible for a regulated financial product like an ETF to engage in staking. Why is Nasdaq Pushing for Staking? Unlocking New Investor Opportunities The inclusion of staking in an Ethereum ETF is a game-changer for several reasons. It addresses a key limitation of previous crypto ETF proposals, which often left out the inherent yield generation capability of PoS assets. For investors, particularly institutions, this means: Enhanced Returns: Staking rewards can provide an additional layer of return beyond just price appreciation. This makes the ETF potentially more competitive and appealing compared to simply holding Ether directly or through other non-staking vehicles. Simplified Access: Investing in an ETF through traditional brokerage accounts is far simpler than setting up and managing a personal staking operation. This lowers the barrier to entry for a broader range of investors, including those who are not comfortable with self-custody or the technicalities of staking. The ETF handles all the complexities, from selecting staking providers to managing rewards and risks. Institutional-Grade Security: By leveraging established custodians and staking providers, the ETF can offer a level of security and compliance that individual investors might find challenging to replicate. This institutional wrapper is crucial for attracting large asset managers, pension funds, and wealth advisors. Diversification of Investment Strategies: For portfolio managers, an Ethereum ETF with staking could serve as a unique asset class that offers both growth potential and yield, fitting into various i",bitcoinworld,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/nasdaq-ethereum-etf-staking/,ETH|REGULATION|BUSINESS|MARKET|BTC,Crypto News|ETF|ETHEREUM|Nasdaq|SEC|Staking,BTC,"Unlocking Potential: Nasdaq’s Pivotal Ethereum ETF Staking Proposal.

Even if your primary focus is on digital assets, understanding the broader economic landscape, particularly the U.S. Stock Market , is absolutely vital. Today’s news brings a wave of optimism from Wall Street, with all three major U.S. stock market indices closing higher. This positive movement isn’t just a win for traditional investors; it carries significant implications for the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Let’s dive into what these gains mean and how they might ripple through the crypto space. U.S. Stock Market Surges: A Closer Look at Key Market Indices The latest closing bell brought smiles to investors as the major U.S. Stock Market indices registered impressive gains. This broad-based rally signals a strong appetite for risk and potentially a brighter outlook on the economy. Here’s a quick snapshot of how the key Market Indices performed: Index Performance S&P 500 +0.59% Nasdaq Composite +0.74% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.52% These figures represent a collective sigh of relief and renewed enthusiasm among investors. The S&P 500, often seen as the broadest measure of U.S. stock market health, showed solid growth. The Dow Jones, home to 30 large, publicly-traded companies, also contributed positively, indicating strength in established industries. But it was the Nasdaq Performance that particularly caught the eye, leading the pack with its robust gains. Why Are These Market Indices Rising Now? Understanding the catalysts behind these gains is crucial. Several factors typically contribute to a positive day on Wall Street, and today was no exception. Often, such upticks are driven by a combination of: Positive Economic Data: Favorable inflation reports, strong employment figures, or better-than-expected GDP growth can signal a healthy economy, boosting corporate earnings prospects. Strong Corporate Earnings: When major companies report profits that exceed analyst expectations, it instills confidence in their future performance and the broader market. Optimistic Central Bank Outlook: Hints from the Federal Reserve about potential interest rate cuts or a less aggressive tightening policy can make borrowing cheaper and stimulate economic activity. Geopolitical Stability: A reduction in global tensions or uncertainty can lead investors to take on more risk, moving capital into equities. While the exact combination of factors can vary daily, the general sentiment indicates that investors are finding reasons to be optimistic about the economic trajectory, which directly influences the performance of these major Market Indices . How Does This Boost Investor Confidence? When the stock market performs well, it naturally cultivates a stronger sense of Investor Confidence . This isn’t just about financial gains; it’s about the psychological impact on market participants. Here’s why rising markets are so powerful: Positive Feedback Loop: Gains encourage more investment, which can lead to further gains, creating a virtuous cycle. Wealth Effect: As portfolios grow, individuals often feel wealthier and more inclined to spend, which can stimulate the economy. Reduced Fear: A rising market can alleviate fears of recession or economic downturns, making investors more willing to take on riskier assets. This heightened Investor Confidence isn’t confined to traditional equities. It can create a ‘risk-on’ environment where capital flows into various asset classes, including those perceived as higher risk, such as cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq Performance: A Bellwether for Tech and Growth The Nasdaq Performance , in particular, often serves as a crucial indicator for growth-oriented assets. Comprising a large number of technology and innovative companies, the Nasdaq Composite’s strong showing suggests that investors are increasingly comfortable with risk and are willing to bet on future growth potential. For crypto enthusiasts, the Nasdaq’s movements are especially relevant: Correlation with Tech Stocks: Many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have historically shown some correlation with tech stocks, as both are often seen as ‘risk-on’ assets. Innovation Driver: A strong Nasdaq implies a healthy environment for innovation and technological advancement, themes that resonate deeply within the crypto space. Institutional Interest: Tech companies and the institutions that invest in them are increasingly exploring blockchain and digital assets. A confident tech sector might signal more institutional capital flowing into crypto. Observing the Nasdaq Performance can therefore offer valuable clues about the broader appetite for speculative and growth-oriented investments, which directly impacts the digital asset landscape.

In a truly remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin price has not just broken a new barrier but has absolutely soared, crossing the monumental $120,000 mark . This isn’t just another incremental gain; it’s a significant milestone that has captured the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts worldwide. According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, and confirmed by trading data on the Binance USDT market where BTC is currently trading at $120,000 , this ascent signals a powerful shift in the market’s dynamics. What exactly is fueling this incredible climb, and what does it mean for the future of the cryptocurrency market ? The Unprecedented Rise: What Propelled Bitcoin Price Beyond $120,000? For weeks, anticipation has been building, and now, the Bitcoin price has delivered a stunning performance. This wasn’t a sudden spike out of nowhere; it’s the culmination of several converging factors that have created a perfect storm for growth. Understanding these catalysts is key to grasping the magnitude of this achievement. Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows: The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. These vehicles provide a regulated and accessible way for large funds and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, significantly increasing demand. Halving Narrative: With the Bitcoin halving event on the horizon, the inherent scarcity mechanism of Bitcoin is becoming more pronounced. Historically, halvings have preceded significant bull runs, as the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation is cut in half, reducing supply against potentially rising demand. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, often drive investors towards alternative assets. Bitcoin, increasingly seen as a ‘digital gold,’ benefits from this flight to safety and a hedge against traditional financial instability. Growing Retail Interest: Beyond institutions, a resurgence in retail investor interest is evident. Social media trends, mainstream media coverage, and the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) phenomenon are bringing new participants into the market, adding to the buying pressure. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability solutions and broader utility, also contribute to its long-term appeal and perceived value. Understanding the Mechanics of This Monumental BTC Rally A BTC rally of this scale is not merely about price; it’s about the underlying market mechanics and the psychological shifts that accompany such rapid growth. The move past $120,000 reflects robust buying pressure and a strong belief among participants in Bitcoin’s continued appreciation. Market dynamics at play include: Supply-Demand Imbalance: The available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has been steadily decreasing, indicating that holders are opting to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell. Coupled with increased demand from ETFs and retail investors, this creates a classic supply-demand imbalance pushing prices higher. Liquidity and Market Depth: The market has demonstrated impressive depth, absorbing large buy orders without significant price resistance, suggesting strong underlying liquidity and confidence. Positive Feedback Loop: As prices rise, more positive news emerges, attracting even more investors, which in turn fuels further price increases. This creates a powerful positive feedback loop. Let’s consider some key factors driving the current BTC rally : Factor Description Impact on Price Spot Bitcoin ETFs Regulated investment vehicles allowing traditional investors easy access to BTC. Significant capital inflow, increased legitimacy. Bitcoin Halving Event reducing the supply of new Bitcoin by half every four years. Creates scarcity, historically bullish. Global Macro Trends Inflation, interest rates, geopolitical stability. Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Network Development Ongoing improvements to Bitcoin’s infrastructure and utility. Enhances long-term value proposition. Wider Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Bitcoin’s performance rarely stays isolated. This significant Bitcoin surge has ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency market . When Bitcoin rallies, it often pulls the rest of the market with it, albeit with varying degrees of intensity. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‘altcoin season’ if Bitcoin’s dominance stabilizes or slightly recedes after its initial surge, allowing capital to flow into other digital assets.

Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows: The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. These vehicles provide a regulated and accessible way for large funds and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, significantly increasing demand. Halving Narrative: With the Bitcoin halving event on the horizon, the inherent scarcity mechanism of Bitcoin is becoming more pronounced. Historically, halvings have preceded significant bull runs, as the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation is cut in half, reducing supply against potentially rising demand. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, often drive investors towards alternative assets. Bitcoin, increasingly seen as a ‘digital gold,’ benefits from this flight to safety and a hedge against traditional financial instability. Growing Retail Interest: Beyond institutions, a resurgence in retail investor interest is evident. Social media trends, mainstream media coverage, and the ‘fear of missing out’ (FOMO) phenomenon are bringing new participants into the market, adding to the buying pressure. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability solutions and broader utility, also contribute to its long-term appeal and perceived value. Understanding the Mechanics of This Monumental BTC Rally A BTC rally of this scale is not merely about price; it’s about the underlying market mechanics and the psychological shifts that accompany such rapid growth. The move past $120,000 reflects robust buying pressure and a strong belief among participants in Bitcoin’s continued appreciation. Market dynamics at play include: Supply-Demand Imbalance: The available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has been steadily decreasing, indicating that holders are opting to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell. Coupled with increased demand from ETFs and retail investors, this creates a classic supply-demand imbalance pushing prices higher. Liquidity and Market Depth: The market has demonstrated impressive depth, absorbing large buy orders without significant price resistance, suggesting strong underlying liquidity and confidence. Positive Feedback Loop: As prices rise, more positive news emerges, attracting even more investors, which in turn fuels further price increases. This creates a powerful positive feedback loop. Let’s consider some key factors driving the current BTC rally : Factor Description Impact on Price Spot Bitcoin ETFs Regulated investment vehicles allowing traditional investors easy access to BTC. Significant capital inflow, increased legitimacy. Bitcoin Halving Event reducing the supply of new Bitcoin by half every four years. Creates scarcity, historically bullish. Global Macro Trends Inflation, interest rates, geopolitical stability. Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Network Development Ongoing improvements to Bitcoin’s infrastructure and utility. Enhances long-term value proposition. Wider Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Bitcoin’s performance rarely stays isolated. This significant Bitcoin surge has ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency market . When Bitcoin rallies, it often pulls the rest of the market with it, albeit with varying degrees of intensity. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‘altcoin season’ if Bitcoin’s dominance stabilizes or slightly recedes after its initial surge, allowing capital to flow into other digital assets. Is This the Dawn of a New Crypto Bull Cycle? Many analysts believe that Bitcoin breaking through key resistance levels and establishing new all-time highs could signal the beginning of a sustained"

2025-07-18 03:00:56+00:00,BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS Offers Full Access as BONK Hits $507M & TAO Eyes $779 in 2025,"Bitcoin’s recent record price is sparking fresh energy across the crypto landscape. Riding this momentum, Bittensor (TAO) is gaining traction as experts forecast a sharp climb toward $779 by 2025, powered by its AI-based model. BONK is also heating up, with strong trading activity and record-setting launchpad revenue placing it back in the spotlight. At the same time, BlockDAG has launched a NO VESTING PASS that unlocks 100% of purchased coins at launch, only 8 days remain.This comes with a discounted price of $0.0016 and has already pushed BlockDAG past the $340.5 million funding mark. Early batches have seen 2,660% returns, positioning BDAG as a top crypto coin to buy now. Bittensor Price Prediction: $779 Forecast as AI Demand Rises Bittensor (TAO) is in the spotlight again, especially after attracting $17.5 million in backing from major firms since June 2025. The current price is near $437, but analysts predict it could climb to $779 in 2025 and possibly soar to $5,915 by 2030. This outlook stems from TAO’s innovative model, where daily rewards go directly to subnet builders creating AI applications inside its system. As AI adoption grows, Bittensor’s real-world use cases keep expanding. While there are still some risks from regulatory issues or market volatility, many believe the project has room to grow. Its AI-linked structure gives it staying power, with continued attention from crypto followers focused on long-term growth. BONK Price Forecast: $507M Activity Pushes New Targets BONK has been on an upward trend, gaining nearly 20% in the past week and trading around $0.000027. Market watchers are closely monitoring its rise as BONK’s launchpad posted $7.97 million in revenue in just one week, more than all other Solana launchpads combined. Its open interest has now topped $507 million, showing growing momentum and rising trader confidence. Looking ahead, analysts believe $0.000034 is the next resistance level. Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD remain bullish, though the overbought reading may signal a small correction before another move upward. Still, BONK’s volume and community backing make it one of the more active memecoins right now. BlockDAG’s Limited-time NO VESTING PASS Deal Adds Urgency to $340.5M Surge As Bitcoin reaches new highs, BlockDAG’s move to introduce a 10-day NO VESTING PASS is hitting the market at just the right moment. This unique offer lets buyers unlock 100% of the BDAG coins they purchase during this short window. While bonus coins remain locked, all regular purchases are fully accessible at launch, no delays, no partial unlocks. That’s a major shift in a space where most launches include long lock-up periods. This clear structure is helping BlockDAG attract attention fast. It has already raised over $340.5 million in presale and sold 23.9 billion coins. Buyers in earlier batches have seen gains of up to 2,660%, measured against the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Now, with BDAG priced at just $0.0016 until August 11, there’s a final shot to secure a steep discount before the price rises to the official $0.05 launch rate. That difference could mean a possible 3,025% return if targets are met. This short window, paired with full access, is rare in the crypto space. As interest builds and more coins get locked in daily, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a must-watch project. For anyone tracking the top crypto coins to buy now, BDAG is emerging as a serious contender. Summing It Up The crypto market is showing real movement again. Bittensor (TAO) is riding the AI wave with projections hitting $779, while BONK is gaining fast thanks to strong launchpad returns and a $507 million open interest. But it’s BlockDAG that’s creating the biggest shake-up. The 10-day NO VESTING PASS, the $0.0016 entry point, and its $340.5 million milestone make it hard to ignore. With 23.9 billion coins already sold and full access guaranteed at launch, the project offers a rare edge. If the question is which crypto coins to buy now, TAO, BONK, and BlockDAG each bring a powerful angle, but BDAG’s offer makes it the most immediate play.

2025-07-18 04:00:34+00:00,Bitcoin Trades Above $117K as Whale Deposits Decline and Stablecoin Inflows Rise,"Bitcoin continues to maintain upward momentum despite a recent pullback from its all-time high. Currently trading at $117,847, the asset has recorded nearly a 10% gain over the past week. The dip from peak levels, approximately a 4.1% decline, has not dampened broader investor sentiment, with several on-chain indicators suggesting renewed buying interest and reduced selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds – $0–$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive Bitcoin Whale Withdrawals Decline, While Stablecoins Flow In In a recent analysis posted to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, analyst Amr Taha shared insights pointing to a strategic change in behavior among key Bitcoin holders and investors. The report, titled “Stablecoin Flood and Whale Retreat: Binance Moves Foreshadow Risk-On Sentiment”, outlined significant trends in whale activity and stablecoin flows that may support continued bullish momentum in the near term. Taha’s research highlighted a steep reduction in whale-level Bitcoin deposits on Binance. Over the past 30 days, these deposits have dropped from $6.75 billion to $4.5 billion, a $2.25 billion decline. Historically, large deposits from whales to centralized exchanges often signal an intention to sell, so the recent drop may imply a reduction in immediate sell-side pressure. This could stabilize Bitcoin’s price in the short term, especially if whales continue to hold or move assets to cold storage instead of preparing them for sale. At the same time, stablecoin flows have increased dramatically across major exchanges. On July 16, Binance and HTX saw combined stablecoin inflows exceeding $1.7 billion. Taha interpreted this as an indication that large entities, possibly institutions or whales, are preparing to accumulate digital assets. Large stablecoin deposits often precede significant buying activity, suggesting that the market could be gearing up for another leg higher, particularly if paired with reduced sell-side movements. Macroeconomic Developments and Miner Sentiment Add Context This on-chain activity is unfolding amid broader economic and political developments. Taha’s report also pointed to speculation around President Donald Trump’s comments during a private meeting, in which he reportedly considered replacing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Though later denied, the remark sparked reactions in traditional markets, including a weaker dollar and rising bond yields. These shifts signaled a rotation into risk assets, potentially benefiting crypto markets as investors reallocate capital in anticipation of a more accommodative monetary stance.

Its long-term goal is to hold 1% of Bitcoin’s total supply. If reached, this would place the company among the top 20 corporate Bitcoin holders worldwide. CEO Deven Soni said the company is built around Bitcoin. “Our business is structured around Bitcoin as a core asset,” he stated. New Filing Supports Treasury Growth To support its plans, Matador filed a CA$900 million shelf prospectus on July 14. The filing will let the company raise funds over the next 25 months. Capital may come from equity offerings, convertible deals, asset sales, Bitcoin-backed loans, or new partnerships. Earlier this month, Matador received final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange to operate as a hybrid “technology/investment issuer.” This change gives the company more room to develop a Bitcoin-focused strategy while still working on blockchain-related projects. Strategy Focused on BTC Accumulation The company has described its approach as a “compounding flywheel” strategy. It includes growing its Bitcoin holdings, increasing BTC-per-share value, and using market volatility and synthetic mining to build yield. The plan also includes creating BTC-based revenue streams and working with DeFi and crypto infrastructure firms. Mark Moss, the company’s chief visionary officer, said the approach is aimed at long-term strength. “Our future plans to accumulate Bitcoin are designed to establish long-term stability on our balance sheet while reducing exposure to inflationary risk,” he said. Matador’s plans come during a rise in corporate Bitcoin ownership. Public and private companies now hold an estimated 1.15 million BTC. That total is around 6% of the current supply. Meanwhile, Strategy continues to lead with the largest BTC treasury, now worth more than $73 billion. Despite the announcement, Matador’s stock fell 4.65%, per Google Finance .

Expectations currently are that the Ethereum price rally will trigger the next altcoin season and possibly lead to a push toward new all-time highs for ETH. One analyst in particular has compared this breakout to what was seen back in May 2025, something that could mean that higher levels are in store for the altcoin. Ethereum Is Mirroring Its Move From May May 2025 has remained one of the most bullish for the Ethereum price so far this year, rallying by more than 40% in a 30-day period. The price had gone from a low of around $1,770 to a high of $2,650 before retracing. But the most important thing was the trend and how the price moved before finally reaching its high. There was an initial surge, then some sideways movement, before the final upsurge to $2,600, and then the eventual top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Just Got Rejected From TSDT Resistance That Triggered Last Altcoin Season — Details According to crypto analyst CryptosBatman on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum price is once again mirroring this price movement that led to its 40% surge. The post highlights the fact that Ethereum has already seen an initial breakout and has begun to move sideways. However, this sideways move is not expected to last long and is actually part of the overall move. As the crypto analyst explained, the same triangle pattern that formed in May 2025 is now forming after the Ethereum price crossed the $3,000 range. Hence, the sideways movement is expected as investors take profit. Once the sideways accumulation is done and the triangle pattern is broken, then Ethereum is expected to begin rallying once again. The next target from here is above $3,600. Factors Driving The ETH Bullish Momentum Other than the fact that the Ethereum price has formed a similar triangle pattern to what was seen back in May, there are also notable developments in terms of accumulation that are also driving the price. For one, Spot Ethereum ETF inflows have continued to ramp up. Related Reading: XRP Becomes Top 3 Crypto After ProShares ETF Approval, Can It Flip ETH?

2025-07-18 05:16:27+00:00,Why Ethereum is Going Up? How High Can the ETH Price Go?,"The post Why Ethereum is Going Up? How High Can the ETH Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has skyrocketed over 70% since July 1, adding $150 billion to its market cap. This historic rally was driven by a massive short squeeze, institutional buying from BlackRock and Trump’s financial group, and upcoming U.S. regulatory reforms. With a $9 trillion retirement market on the horizon, Ethereum’s bullish momentum may just be getting started. Why Did Ethereum Surge 70% in July 2025? Ethereum is making crypto history with one of the largest short squeezes ever recorded. Since July 1, ETH has gained over 70%, recovering from a period of extreme bearish sentiment and liquidating billions in short positions. The rally was sparked when net short exposure on Ethereum hit record highs, 25% higher than the February 2025 peak, triggering a wave of forced liquidations as ETH began to rise. According to The Kobeissi Letter, a further 10% ETH price increase could result in another $1 billion in short liquidations, pushing prices even higher. Who’s Buying Ethereum? Trump and BlackRock Lead the Pack The timing of major institutional purchases suggests the smart money moved first. World Liberty Financial , linked to President Trump, bought $5 million worth of ETH just a day before Kobeissi’s post went viral. BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF has been accumulating ETH for 29 out of the past 30 days—well ahead of the retail crowd. These actions indicate that institutional players may have anticipated the short squeeze before it fully unfolded. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and Other Altcoins? While Ethereum stole the spotlight, Bitcoin quietly reclaimed the $120,000 level, recovering nearly $900 billion in market cap since April. XRP is also seeing bullish momentum , reflecting a broader capital rotation into altcoins. “Ethereum could hit $15,000 to $20,000 in this cycle,” says Colin Talks Crypto . Could a $9 Trillion Retirement Market Push ETH Even Higher? The most explosive catalyst might still be ahead. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans, worth $8.7 trillion, to invest in cryptocurrencies. If passed, this could unlock more than double the capital of the current global crypto market. This would mark the first time regulated retirement funds could directly allocate to crypto assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin. What Role Are U.S. Crypto Laws Playing in This Rally? Ethereum’s rally is not just technical—it’s political and structural. In July, the U.S. House passed : The Clarity Act – Defines digital asset classifications The Genius Act – Regulates stablecoins The Anti-CBDC Act – Limits the Federal Reserve’s digital currency authority With bipartisan support now behind these bills, the U.S. crypto market is entering a more mature and regulated phase, creating confidence for long-term institutional involvement. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: Ripple’s XRP Hits New ATH Following Successful Crypto Week , How High Can Ethereum Go in 2025?

Momentum is holding firm above key exponential moving averages, keeping bulls in control for now. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin price action stabilizing between converging support and resistance trendlines. The triangle pattern began forming after the breakout candle above $100,000 and has persisted despite multiple failed breakout attempts near $121,500. Notably, the 20/50/100/200 EMA cluster remains stacked below the current price, with the 20 EMA providing consistent dynamic support near $118,600. The rising On-Balance Volume (OBV) further supports the bullish case, as buying pressure has remained steady throughout the compression phase.

2025-07-18 05:30:00+00:00,US House Passes 3 Major Crypto Bills Before August Recess,"The bipartisan support for the first two bills indicates that there is growing political momentum behind establishing clearer crypto market rules. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is expected to sign the GENIUS Act and may also issue an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans to invest in cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets. In addition to this, Trump recently nominated Eric Tung, a lawyer with extensive crypto industry ties, to the influential Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. House Passes Three Crypto Bills The US House of Representatives passed three key pieces of cryptocurrency legislation after delays caused by Republican debates over central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In a session that was held Thursday, lawmakers approved the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act with a 294-134 vote, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act with a 308-122 vote, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act by a narrower margin of 219-210. Voting in the CLARITY Act (Source: US House of Representatives ) The passage of these bills is a massive legislative milestone in the US digital asset landscape. Almost 80 Democrats voted in favor of the CLARITY Act, while more than 100 supported the GENIUS Act. The support from both parties for two of the three bills suggests that there is growing bipartisan momentum for crypto regulation, though the Anti-CBDC legislation is still deeply divisive. Republicans strongly rallied behind the legislative package as part of their self-declared “crypto week.” However, the legislative process was delayed on Wednesday as some Republicans demanded a clearer stance against the development of a US CBDC. Industry stakeholders mostly welcomed the House’s approval of the bills. Summer Mersinger, former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and current CEO of the Blockchain Association, praised the Anti-CBDC measure as a defense of individual financial freedom and market competition. Despite this optimism, the opposition was also quite vocal. Representative Maxine Waters of California condemned the bills during a press conference she branded as “anti-crypto corruption week,” and warned that the proposed legislation could weaken federal financial safeguards and open the door to systemic risks similar to the 2008 financial crisis. Truth Social post from President Donald Trump President Trump is reportedly ready to sign the GENIUS Act by Friday, assuming it remains unchanged after passing the Senate in June. Meanwhile, the CLARITY and Anti-CBDC bills will proceed to the Senate for further consideration. This means that they could be amended before returning to the House or reaching the president’s desk. Trump Eyes Crypto in 401(k) Plans President Donald Trump is also reportedly preparing to sign an executive order that could open the door for American 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds, including cryptocurrencies. According to a report by the Financial Times , the executive order may be signed as early as this week and would direct regulatory agencies in Washington to explore how 401(k) plans could incorporate digital assets, metals, and funds related to infrastructure projects, corporate acquisitions, and private lending. President Donald Trump The initiative could cause a big shift in the investment options available to American workers saving for retirement. While the Financial Times cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter, White House spokesman Kush Desai warned that no decision should be considered final unless confirmed by President Trump himself. This potential move follows the US Labor Department’s May decision to rescind restrictions imposed during the Biden administration that limited the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. The regulatory rollback may also pave the way for more institutional involvement in digital assets. Meanwhile, private firms have already started moving in this direction. In April, financial services giant Fidelity, which manages $5.9 trillion in assets, launched a new crypto-enabled retirement account for American investors. The broader 401(k) market consisted of over 715,000 plans that held $8.9 trillion in assets in September of 2024. Fidelity crypto offering At the state level, North Carolina lawmakers introduced legislation in March that would allow up to 5% of various public retirement funds to be allocated to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Internationally, pension funds in the United Kingdom and Japan also explored crypto allocations. In November, UK-based Cartwright reported that an undisclosed pension scheme committed 3% of its assets to Bitcoin, while Japan’s Government Pension Investment Fund was weighing the digital asset as a diversification strategy.

2025-07-18 05:46:35+00:00,Dollar extends weekly rally as strong data delays fed cuts,"The U.S. dollar looks set to record a second straight weekly rise against other major economies, driven by strong economic data that have eased worries about Fed rate cuts. Data this week showed U.S. retail sales climbed more than analysts had forecast in June, while new claims for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in three months. Those results reinforced the belief that the Fed can hold rates steady for longer before considering a reduction, according to a Reuters report. As of 00:38 GMT, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six leading currencies, was unchanged at 98.456. That kept it on course for a 0.64% gain this week, following a 0.91% jump in the previous seven days. On Thursday, the index even peaked at 98.951, its highest level since June 23. A recent report showed that U.S. consumer prices rose in June by the most in five months. This suggests that recent tariff hikes may be starting to push up inflation. Investors now expect slightly less easing, just under 0.5% in rate cuts by December, down from about 0.5% forecast earlier this week. Despite this week’s strength, the dollar remains 9.3% below its level at the beginning of the year. In March and April, fears of unpredictable U.S. trade policies led to a big sell‑off that hurt confidence in U.S. assets, including the dollar, Treasury yields, and stocks. Markets reacted to Trump firing Powell rumor Concerns about the U.S. budget have shaken investors. Lawmakers’ large spending and tax plans have raised doubts about fiscal stability. At the same time, President Trump has repeatedly scolded Fed Chair Powell for not cutting rates faster. Analysts at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia warned that the dollar “remains vulnerable to the downside if concerns about U.S. policymaking further undermine investor confidence in USD assets.” They pointed to this week’s sudden dip, triggered by rumors that Trump planned to fire Powell, as proof of that risk. Bitcoin hovered just below $120,000 after briefly hitting $123,153.22, and the market got a boost when Congress passed rules for dollar‑pegged stablecoins. Dollar strong against yen while euro and pound made modest moves Meanwhile Japan’s yen weakened as Sunday’s upper‑house elections approached, with polls showing the ruling party could lose its majority. A change in power could make monetary policy less predictable. It can slow down tariff talks with Washington. On foreign exchange markets, the dollar was trading around ¥148.60, not far from Wednesday’s three‑and‑a‑half‑month peak of ¥149.19. Japan’s lead trade envoy, Ryosei Akazawa, held talks on Thursday with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an eleventh‑hour bid to block a 25% tariff scheduled to apply once August 1 has passed. Elsewhere, the euro climbed 0.25% to $1.1626, bouncing back from its Thursday trough near $1.1556, though it still finished the week 0.59% lower.

May 30, 2025- Comprehensive Ownership Ban The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership. The crypto ban decree became effective from June 1, 2025, states the suspension of crypto transactions, asset seizure measures, enforcement, and penalties.

By implementing the recent ban on cryptocurrency, the Chinese government is reaffirming its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital currency, the yuan . Its current focus is on: Outlawing private ownership of crypto Accelerating the adoption of central bank digital currency (CBDC) Mitigating financial risks related to crypto Reasserts its financial hegemony by banning decentralized crypto Crypto Tax in China As China implemented a ban on crypto trading, mining, and ownership, any crypto tax is irrelevant.

Crypto License in China China does not have any crypto license, as Beijing has expanded its crypto ban. Since no one will be able to hold crypto or other digital assets (except its own digital yuan), a license implementation is not necessary. Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Before China enforced the crypto ban in 2025, the adoption rate was fluctuating, and the market was unstable. Since Chinese crypto policies are too strict and have made the market sentiment rigid, it has influenced users to use VPNs to access foreign exchanges. This raised some concerns regarding crypto, and eventually, the government banned it. Conclusion When crypto was regulated in China, the government had a comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financial terrorism (CFT) framework. However, after its historical changes of banning private ownership of crypto, China is focusing on centralizing the political power and encouraging the country’s own digital currency. Despite the restrictions, use of crypto for illicit activity remains a concern for the Chinese government. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-wid",coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/cryptocurrency-regulation/crypto-regulations-in-china-in-2024/,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BTC,Cryptocurrency Regulation|Crypto Regulations,BTC,"Crypto Regulations In China 2025.
